The loan was funded in June 2014.\\n\\nWithin a month, PEX had drawn down nearly the entire loan amount. PEX operated for approximately three months before suspending service. In the aftermath of the suspension of operations, various creditors sought repayment from PEX in 2014 and 2015, according to a news release from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Virginia.\\n\\nAt the same time, Morisi opened new bank accounts to receive insurance proceeds and avoid the seizure of funds.\\n\\nMorisi gave false representations to creditors (including the PAC, which paid more than $4 million to satisfy the TowneBank loan) claiming that no funds were available, according to court documents.\\n\\nHe made large purported back salary payments to himself and other executives in lieu of paying creditors, prosecutors said.\\n\\nWhen the first bank account was made subject to a state tax lien, Morisi moved accounts again so that he could receive and divert additional insurance proceeds. He also filed false tax returns for three years omitting income and failed to file returns for two additional years, according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office.\\n\\nIn early 2017, a state audit at the airport dug into the matter of the Peninsula Airport Commission using taxpayer dollars to back the $5 million line of credit.\\n\\nThe 2017 audit caused another airline, Elite Airways, to withdraw from a plan to start service to the Newport News airport, citing “challenging perceptions” about the airport.\\n\\nFormer director Ken Spirito was indicted in May on several federal finance charges, according to an Associated Press report. The indictment includes charges of money laundering, and accuses Spirito of hiding public funds that were used to finance People Express Airlines in 2014.'"
