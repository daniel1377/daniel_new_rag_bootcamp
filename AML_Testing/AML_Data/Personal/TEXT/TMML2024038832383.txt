Treasury Targets Leading Figures And Syndicate Of Transnational Criminal Organizations

Action Builds on Treasury’s Targeted Campaign Against the Camorra, the Yakuza, the Brothers’ Circle, and MS-13

WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of the Treasury today took additional action against four transnational criminal organizations (TCOs): the Camorra, the Yakuza, the Brothers’ Circle, and Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13). Today’s designations include seven members of the Camorra, one of Europe's largest criminal organizations; the Kudo-kai, a violent syndicate within the Japanese Yakuza criminal network along with two of its leaders; an individual known to act on behalf of the Brothers’ Circle, a large multi-ethnic Eurasian criminal network; and one member of MS-13, a criminal street gang that operates internationally. These designations were imposed under Executive Order (E.O.) 13581, “Blocking Property of Transnational Criminal Organizations,” which targets significant TCOs and individuals or entities determined to have provided material support to, or to be owned or controlled by, or to have acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, such organizations.

President Obama identified the Camorra, the Yakuza, and the Brothers’ Circle, along with the Zetas, as significant TCOs in the Annex to E.O. 13581 on July 24, 2011. Pursuant to this E.O., the Treasury Department has imposed additional sanctions against their members and supporters to undermine and interdict their global criminal operations. The Treasury Department subsequently designated MS-13 as a significant TCO pursuant to E.O. 13581 on October 11, 2012.

Today’s action freezes any assets the designated persons may have within the jurisdiction of the United States and generally prohibits any transactions with them by U.S. persons.

“Those sanctioned today support some of the most violent and destructive criminal organizations in the world. From trafficking in illegal drugs, weapons, and human beings, to laundering the proceeds of their illegal acts, these organizations endanger innocent lives and compromise legitimate businesses,” said Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence David S. Cohen. “Treasury will continue to protect the U.S. and international financial system by exposing and disrupting these groups and those who support them, wherever they may be.”

The Camorra

The Italian Camorra operates internationally and is involved in serious criminal activity such as money laundering, drug trafficking, extortion, alien smuggling, robbery, blackmail, kidnapping, political corruption, and counterfeiting. Although the group is based in Naples, Italy, the negative effects from the organization’s illicit activities have been recognized throughout Italy. Italian law enforcement continues to combat, disrupt, and dismantle this criminal organization, and has conducted multiple operations within the past year to seize Camorra assets, including a single-day seizure of assets worth 450 million Euro from the Camorra’s Casalesi clan in June 2013. Including today’s action, the Treasury Department has designated fourteen individuals affiliated with the Camorra under E.O. 13581.

The individuals designated today for acting for or on behalf of the Camorra were defendants in the famous Spartacus trial held in Italy against the powerful Casalesi clan from Casal di Principe, a town outside of Naples, Italy. They include Francesco Bidognetti and Francesco “Sandokan” Schiavone, two bosses of the Casalesi clan, who received life sentences following their conviction for crimes including murder, assault, and extortion. Two other bosses of the Casalesi clan involved in the Spartacus trial, Antonio Iovine and Michele Zagaria, were designated under E.O. 13581 on August 1, 2012. The other five individuals designated today for acting for or on behalf of the Camorra, Francesco Barbato, Nicola Panaro, Sebastiano Panaro, Nicola Schiavone, and Vincenzo Schiavone, are all high-level members of the Casalesi clan. Francesco Barbato and Nicola Panaro were convicted of extortion; Sebastiano Panaro was convicted of extortion, mafia association, and murder; Vincenzo Schiavone was convicted of mafia association and extortion; and Nicola Schiavone was convicted of triple homicide.

The Yakuza

The Yakuza, reputedly the world’s largest criminal organization with close to 60,000 members, is involved in serious criminal activities, including weapons trafficking, prostitution, human trafficking, drug trafficking, fraud, and money laundering. Including today’s action, the Treasury Department has designated twelve individuals affiliated with the Yakuza and four Yakuza syndicates: the Yamaguchi-gumi, Sumiyoshi-kai, Inagawa-kai, and the Kudo-kai.

The Kudo-kai, which the Treasury Department is designating today for acting for or on behalf of the Yakuza, is reportedly the most violent Yakuza syndicate. The Kudo-kai is headquartered in Fukuoka, Japan and has approximately 950 members, including associate members.

Today, the Treasury Department is also designating Satoru Nomura, the President of the Kudo-kai, as well as the Kudo-kai Chief, Fumio Tanoue, for acting for or on behalf of the Kudo-kai. As Kudo-kai leaders, Nomura and Tanoue are responsible for the group’s operations, including relaying and enforce orders, conducting personnel changes, and promoting Kudo-kai members to lead their own subsidiary groups.

The Brothers’ Circle

The Brothers’ Circle is a multi-ethnic criminal group made up of leaders and senior members of several Eurasian criminal groups largely based in countries of the former Soviet Union but also operating in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America. The Brothers’ Circle serves as a coordinating body for several criminal networks, mediating disputes between the individual criminal networks and directing member criminal activity globally. Including today’s action, the Treasury Department has designated 23 individuals and six entities affiliated with the Brothers’ Circle.

Today, the Treasury Department is designating Adam Sultanovich Delimkhanov, a member of the Russian Duma, pursuant to E.O. 13581 for acting for or on behalf of Gafur Rakhimov, a key member of the Brothers’ Circle designated by the Treasury Department in February 2012.

Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13)

In October 2012, MS-13 became the first transnational criminal street gang to be designated by Treasury as a significant TCO. MS-13 has been involved in serious criminal activity in the United States and around the world, including human smuggling, sex trafficking, drug trafficking, kidnapping, murder, assassinations, racketeering, blackmail, extortion, and immigration offenses. Including today’s action, Treasury has designated seven individuals affiliated with MS-13.

Today, the Treasury Department is designating Jenny Judith Corado Portillo pursuant to E.O. 13581 for acting for or on behalf of MS-13, and Borromeo Enrique Henriquez Solorzano, an MS-13 leader designated by the Treasury Department on June 5, 2013. This action was supported extensively by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Homeland Security Investigations directorate. Jenny Judith Corado Portillo is a member of the Big Gangster Locos Salvatruchas MS-13 clique in El Salvador and the common-law wife of incarcerated MS-13 spokesperson Borromeo Enrique Henriquez Solorzano. Jenny Judith Corado Portillo was arrested in May 2013 on charges of extortion. It is believed she acts as an intermediary for her incarcerated husband Borromeo Enrique Henriquez Solorzano.

February 27, 2014 - Treasury Sanctions Key Sinaloa Cartel Network

The U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) today announced the designation of Hugo Cuellar Hurtado, a dual Colombian-Mexican national, for his material support to the narcotics trafficking activities of the Sinaloa Cartel and one of the organization’s leaders, Juan Jose Esparragoza Moreno (a.k.a. El Azul), pursuant to the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act (Kingpin Act). Six other individuals and ten entities linked to Cuellar Hurtado were also designated. As a result of today’s action, all property and interests in property in the United States, or in the possession or control of U.S. persons in which the individuals and entities designated today have an interest, are blocked, and U.S. persons are generally prohibited from engaging in transactions with them.

The President identified Esparragoza Moreno and the Sinaloa Cartel as significant foreign narcotics traffickers pursuant to the Kingpin Act in 2003 and 2009, respectively. Esparragoza Moreno was indicted on drug trafficking charges in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas in 2003 and is wanted in both the U.S. and Mexico. On February 22, 2014, Mexican authorities captured Joaquin Guzman Loera (a.k.a. El Chapo) – the reputed leader of the Sinaloa Cartel and considered to be among the most wanted criminals in the world. Guzman Loera was identified by the President as a significant foreign narcotics trafficker pursuant to the Kingpin Act in 2001.

“Mexican authorities achieved a major victory with the capture of Chapo Guzman. Building on this success, OFAC will continue targeting the finances and operations of the Sinaloa Cartel and its other leaders, including Esparragoza Moreno,” said OFAC Director Adam J. Szubin. “Today’s action marks the next step in this effort by targeting Hugo Cuellar Hurtado, who poses as a businessman involved in enterprises ranging from ostrich farming to pawn shops. In reality, Cuellar Hurtado is a longtime criminal who supports illicit drug trafficking activities and promotes organized crime.”

Cuellar Hurtado has been engaged in drug trafficking activities for decades. He previously worked for the Medellín drug cartel and shipped cocaine to the United States through Mexico. In the late 1990s, Cuellar Hurtado began living part time in Mexico and eventually began supplying cocaine to the Sinaloa Cartel.

Today’s designation also targets six other individuals, including five of Cuellar Hurtado’s family members. John Fredy Cuellar Silva, the son of Cuellar Hurtado, acts on his father’s behalf and is also providing support to the Sinaloa Cartel’s drug trafficking activities. The other family members were designated today because they act on behalf of Cuellar Hurtado and/or John Fredy Cuellar Silva: Ofelia Margarita Miramontes Gutierrez (Cuellar Hurtado’s current wife), Jenny Johanna Cuellar Silva (Cuellar Hurtado’s daughter), Victor Hugo Cuellar Silva (Cuellar Hurtado’s son), and Gabriela Amarillas Lopez (Cuellar Hurtado’s daughter-in-law). Also designated today is Lucy Amparo Vargas Nunez, who manages Cuellar Hurtado’s assets in Colombia.

The entities designated today include four Mexican companies. Agricola y Ganadera Cuemir and Cooperativa Avestruz Cuemir are located in Tlajomulco de Zuniga, Jalisco, which is near Guadalajara. These companies are engaged in ostrich farming and the breeding of Friesian horses. Casa de Empeno Guadalajara (a.k.a. Empenos Prestafacil) and Prenda Todo (a.k.a. Casa de Empeno Prenda Todo) are both pawn shop companies in Guadalajara.

Further, six Colombian companies were also designated. Agro y Comercio de Santa Barbara Lagromer, Compania Agro Comercial Cueta, and Inversiones Hunel Ltda. are all agricultural companies based in Bogotá. Casa Comercial Oro Rapido, of Girardot, Cundinamarca, and Casa Comercial Uni Quince, of Bogota, are both pawn shops. Hotel Paraiso Resort en Arrendamiento is a lodging establishment located in Rivera, Huila.

Today’s action was taken in close coordination with the Drug Enforcement Administration.

Internationally, OFAC has designated more than 1,300 businesses and individuals linked to 103 drug kingpins since June 2000. Penalties for violations of the Kingpin Act range from civil penalties of up to $1.075 million per violation to more severe criminal penalties. Criminal penalties for corporate officers may include up to 30 years in prison and fines up to $5 million. Criminal fines for corporations may reach $10 million. Other individuals could face up to 10 years in prison and fines pursuant to Title 18 of the United States Code for criminal violations of the Kingpin Act.

January 16, 2014 - Treasury Continues Targeting Sinaloa Cartel Leadership

​Action Targets Senior Lieutenant of Ismael “Mayo” Zambada Garcia, responsible for Narcotics Transportation

The U.S. Department of the Treasury today announced the designation of Jose Guadalupe Tapia Quintero, a Culiacan, Sinaloa, Mexico based senior lieutenant of the Sinaloa Cartel. Jose Guadalupe Tapia Quintero was designated for his role in the drug trafficking activities of Ismael “Mayo” Zambada Garcia and for playing a significant role in international drug trafficking.

“We will continue to target all aspects of the Sinaloa Cartel,” said Treasury’s Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) Adam J. Szubin. “Our actions will focus on the financial nerve points as well as the underlying logistics that are essential to the cartel’s day-to-day operations, such as the transportation network that we are taking action against today.”

Tapia Quintero oversees the transportation of cocaine and marijuana for the Zambada Garcia drug trafficking organization and is responsible for coordinating the purchase and transportation of cocaine and methamphetamine from Sinaloa into the U.S., specifically Arizona and California, on a monthly basis. Tapia Quintero also transports methamphetamine on behalf of a drug trafficking cell affiliated with Joaquin “Chapo” Guzman Loera from Sinaloa to Tijuana, Baja California via tractor trailers. The President identified Joaquin Guzman Loera, Ismael Zambada Garcia, and the Sinaloa Cartel as significant foreign narcotics traffickers pursuant to the Kingpin Act in 2001, 2002 and 2009, respectively.

Today’s action is taken with the support of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), specifically the Phoenix Field Division, and the multi-agency OCDETF Strike Force.

“DEA and its OFAC partners will not allow these dangerous cartels and their associates to exploit the U.S. financial system,” said DEA Special Agent in Charge Doug Coleman. "We’re relentlessly following the financial trail to deprive these traffickers of their assets, draining the lifeblood from their criminal enterprises.”

Pursuant to the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act (Kingpin Act), this designation generally prohibits U.S. persons from conducting financial or commercial transactions with Tapia Quintero, and also freezes any assets he may have under U.S. jurisdiction.

Since June 2000, the President has identified 103 drug kingpins, and OFAC has designated more than 1300 entities and individuals, pursuant to the Kingpin Act. Penalties for violations of the Kingpin Act range from civil penalties of up to $1.075 million per violation to more severe criminal penalties. Criminal penalties for corporate officers may include up to 30 years in prison and fines up to $5 million. Criminal fines for corporations may reach $10 million. Other individuals could face up to 10 years in prison and fines pursuant to Title 18 of the United States Code for criminal violations of the Kingpin Act.

October 30, 2013 - Transnational Criminal Organizations Designations

The U.S. Department of the Treasury today designated six individuals and four entities linked to the Brothers’ Circle, a Eurasian crime syndicate, pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 13581, which targets significant transnational criminal organizations (TCOs). Today’s actions are focused on the criminal networks of two key members of the Brothers Circle, Vladislav Leontyev and Gafur Rakhimov, both of whom were designated by the Treasury Department for acting on behalf of the Brothers’ Circle in February 2012. Today’s designations include individuals and businesses in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East working on behalf of Leontyev and Rakhimov and support Treasury’s efforts to disrupt the illicit financial networks that provide revenue and support for their global criminal activities.

“The key to targeting transnational criminal organizations, such as the Brothers’ Circle, is exposing the network behind the group’s leaders, which we have done today. We remain determined to continue our systematic effort to disrupt these networks in order to protect the U.S. financial system from abuse by these criminals,” said Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence David S. Cohen.

The Brothers’ Circle is one of five TCOs sanctioned under E.O. 13581, along with the Camorra, the Yakuza, Los Zetas, and MS-13. Today’s action brings to 28 the total number of individuals and entities designated by the Treasury Department for acting for or on behalf of the Brothers’ Circle.

The Brothers’ Circle is a criminal group composed of leaders and senior members of several Eurasian criminal groups that are largely based in the countries of the former Soviet Union, but which also operate in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America. The Brothers’ Circle serves as a coordinating body for several criminal networks, mediates disputes between individual criminal networks, and directs member criminal activity globally.

Today’s action generally prohibits U.S. persons from conducting financial or commercial transactions with these entities and individuals, and freezes any assets they may have under U.S. jurisdiction.

Targets Linked to Vladislav Leontyev - Vladislav Leontyev was designated by the Treasury Department under E.O. 13581 on February 23, 2012, for acting for or on behalf of the Brothers’ Circle. Vladislav Leontyev is a key member of the Brothers’ Circle and has been involved in various criminal activities, including narcotics trafficking. He was also involved in a shooting between regional factions within Russian organized criminal networks over an attempt to seize control of a local precious metals enterprise. The following individuals were designated today, along with entities they own or control, because they act for or on behalf of Vladislav Leontyev:

Vadim Lyalin serves as a conduit for passing messages on behalf of Vladislav Leontyev;

Grigory Lepsveridze couriers money on behalf of Vladislav Leontyev;

Igor Shlykov has worked to get identification documents and to develop business opportunities in Africa on Vladislav Leontyev’s behalf. Igor Shlykov also owns or controls M S Group Invest OOO and Meridian Jet Management GmbH based in Russia and Austria respectively. He is the director-general of M S Group Invest OOO and owns 60 percent of Meridian Jet Management GmbH;

Gurgen House FZCO is owned or controlled by Lazar Shaybazian who was designated in February 2012, for acting for or on behalf of Vladislav Leontyev. Gurgen House FZCO has offices in the U.A.E., Uzbekistan, and Russia. Lazar Shaybazian uses Gurgen House FZCO to move money.

Targets Linked to Gafur Rakhimov - In February 2012, Gafur Rakhimov was designated by the Treasury Department pursuant to E.O. 13581 for acting on behalf of the Brothers’ Circle. Gafur Rakhimov is a key member of the Brothers’ Circle and one of the leaders of Uzbek organized crime with a specialty in the organized production of drugs in Central Asia. He has operated major international drug syndicates involving the trafficking of heroin. Sergey Moskalenko and Yakov Rybalskiy were designated today by the Treasury Department because they act for or on behalf of Gafur Rakhimov.

Artur Badalyan - Artur Badalyan and his company Fasten Tourism LLC were designed today pursuant to E.O. 13581 because they are used by key members of the Brothers’ Circle to courier money and make travel arrangements. Artur Badalyan is the owner and CEO of Fasten Tourism LLC.

July 24, 2013 - New Sanctions Announced Against the Camorra and the Brothers' Circle

Treasury Designates Members And Supporters of Transnational Criminal Organizations

7/24/2013 New Sanctions Announced Against the Camorra and the Brothers' Circle

WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of the Treasury today designated five members of the Italian Camorra, including the mob boss Marco Di Lauro and the fugitive Mario Riccio, as well as two businesses linked to individuals acting on behalf of a key member of the Brothers' Circle, a large multi-ethnic Eurasian criminal network. These Transnational Criminal Organizations (TCOs) continue to use various methods to conceal the proceeds earned from their illicit activities and maintain access to the international financial system. Today's actions are the latest in the Treasury Department's use of executive authorities to expose, undermine, and disrupt these criminal activities which include: money laundering, extortion, drug trafficking, kidnapping and counterfeiting.

"Today's action against key members of criminal organizations that engage in serious crimes around the world is a continuation of our systematic effort to expose and disrupt these dangerous groups and protect the U.S. financial system from their illicit activity," said Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence David S. Cohen.

President Obama identified the Camorra, and the Brothers' Circle, along with the Yakuza and the Zetas, as significant TCOs in the Annex to Executive Order (E.O.) 13581 (Blocking Property of Transnational Criminal Organizations) in July 2011, and he charged the Treasury Department with pursuing additional sanctions against their members and supporters to undermine and interdict their global criminal operations.

Today's action freezes any assets these individuals and businesses may have within the jurisdiction of the United States and generally prohibits any transactions with them by U.S. persons. To date, the Treasury Department has designated 34 individuals and entities related to TCOs and has exposed their activity ranging from Europe to Asia to the Middle East. Treasury will continue to target additional members and supporters of these groups, as well as identify other significant TCOs, such as MS-13 which was named in October 2012, in order to expose and disrupt their criminal operations and protect the U.S. financial system from abuse.

The Camorra - The Camorra operates internationally and is involved in serious criminal activity, such as money laundering, extortion, alien smuggling, robbery, blackmail, kidnapping, political corruption, and counterfeiting. Italian law enforcement has conducted multiple operations this year to seize Camorra assets, including a single-day seizure of 450 million euros from the Casalesi clan in June. To date, Treasury has designated nine individuals affiliated with the Camorra under E.O. 13581.

The Camorra members designated today have all played a role in the recent inter-clan violence that has wreaked havoc on northern Naples. In October 2012, all five were identified by Italian authorities as involved in the murder of a bystander to the feud. Marco Di Lauro has been on Italy's Most Wanted List since 2004 for mafia-related activities. Mario Riccio is involved in a drug trafficking business that nets tens of millions of euros every year. Until his capture in January, Antonio Mennetta was in charge of a group responsible for assassinating enemies of a young splinter clan supported by Di Lauro, the "Vanella Grassi" or "Girati". Mariano Abete, also currently in jail, was arrested for mafia associated activity and conspiracy to deal drugs. Rosario Guarino, implicated in a dozen murders, was arrested in November 2012 for mafia associated activities and drug trafficking. Each of these five individuals were designated for acting for or on behalf of, or providing material support to, the Camorra.

The Brothers' Circle - The Brothers' Circle is a multi-ethnic criminal group composed of leaders and senior members of several Eurasian criminal groups largely based in countries of the former Soviet Union but extending to Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America. To date, Treasury has designated 16 individuals connected with the Brothers' Circle, including both Brothers' Circle members and their subordinates, under E.O. 13581. These designated individuals include key member Vladislav Leontyev, as well as two individuals acting for or on his behalf, Aleksandr Manuylov and Lazar Shaybazian. Leontyev, Manuylov, and Shaybazian were designated by Treasury in February 2012. Today, Treasury is taking action against the companies Avuar OOO and Guga Arm SRO because they are owned or controlled by Aleksandr Manuylov and Lazar Shaybazian, respectively. Aleksandr Manuylov is the sole director of Avuar OOO while Lazar Shaybazian is the director, sole board member, and 100 percent owner of Guga Arm SRO.

US Department of the Treasury Press Release

July 23, 2013 - Treasury Sanctions Financial Operatives Linked to Los Zetas

The U.S. Department of the Treasury today designated two Mexican nationals, Jose Odilon Ramirez Perales and Ismael Lopez Guerrero, pursuant to the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act (Kingpin Act) for their ties to Mexico’s violent Los Zetas drug trafficking organization.

Ramirez Perales is a powerful financial operative responsible for controlling and laundering tens of millions of dollars in funds smuggled from the U.S. to Mexico for Los Zetas leaders Miguel Trevino Morales and Omar Trevino Morales. Lopez Guerrero collects illicit monies from Los Zetas operations in Nuevo Laredo, and he sends large quantities of smuggled cash to Ramirez Perales for safeguarding and processing in Coahuila, Mexico. “The momentous arrest of Miguel Trevino Morales, who was captured last week, took place in the early morning hours with two of his closest advisors by his side, including a key accountant. This is another clear example of the central importance of financial operatives within the operational structure of drug cartels,” said Treasury’s Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) Adam J. Szubin. “Treasury’s action today targets the activities of two other significant financial operatives for Los Zetas. We will continue to support our Mexican partners to target those laundering Los Zetas’ ill-gotten gains.”

Ramirez Perales is wanted in the Southern District of Texas for money laundering relating to drug trafficking. Ramirez Perales and his other co-defendants are subject to the forfeiture of approximately $20 million in the Southern District of Texas. In October 2012, Mexican authorities captured Ramirez Perales, and they arrested Lopez Guerrero after a July 2012 gun battle. Lopez Guerrero, who uses the alias Gilberto Godina Guerrero, was alleged to possess ammunition, drugs, and currency at the time of his arrest. The arrests of these individuals and other high level Los Zetas members such as Miguel Trevino Morales, along with the death of former Zeta leader Heriberto Lazcano-Lazcano, has played a vital role in weakening of the organization.

Today’s action generally prohibits U.S. persons from engaging in any transactions with these individuals and freezes any assets they may have under U.S. jurisdiction.

The President identified Los Zetas as a significant foreign narcotics trafficker pursuant to the Kingpin Act in April 2009. On July 24, 2011, the President named Los Zetas as a significant Transnational Criminal Organization in the Annex to Executive Order 13581 (Blocking Property of Transnational Criminal Organizations). Additionally, OFAC designated Los Zetas leaders Miguel and Omar Trevino Morales on July 20, 2009 and March 24, 2010, respectively. Since 2009, OFAC has designated several dozen key plaza bosses, drug traffickers, and money launderers operating on behalf of Los Zetas using Kingpin Act authorities.

Internationally, OFAC has designated more than 1,200 individuals and entities linked to 103 drug kingpins since June 2000. OFAC designations are part of an ongoing effort to apply financial measures against significant foreign narcotics traffickers and their organizations worldwide. Penalties for violations of the Kingpin Act range from civil penalties of up to $1.075 million per violation to more severe criminal penalties. Criminal penalties for corporate officers may include up to 30 years in prison and fines up to $5 million. Criminal fines for corporations may reach $10 million. Other individuals face up to 10 years in prison and fines pursuant to Title 18 of the United States Code for criminal violations of the Kingpin Act.

June 05, 2013 - Transnational Criminal Organizations Designations - Mara Salvatrucha Leaders aka MS13

The Mara Salvatrucha gang originated in Los Angeles and has spread to Central America, other parts of the United States, and Canada. It is commonly abbreviated as MS, Mara, and MS-13. There is some dispute about the etymology of the name. The most common belief is that the word "Mara" refers to the Spanish word for "gang", and "Salvatrucha" (which is Spanish slang) for "Salvadoran army ant". Alternatively, it is suggested that "Salvatrucha" refers to the Salvadoran peasant guerrillas, the source of much of the gang's early manpower. The number 13 is homage to the Los Angeles gang "Los Emes" or "The Ms"(M being the thirteenth letter of the alphabet). The gang was set up in Los Angeles in 1980's by Salvadoran immigrants in the city's Pico-Union neighborhood. Source: Urban Dictionary

June 05, 2013 - Treasury Sanctions Significant Members Of MS-13 - Designation Targets Notorious Gang Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13)

The U.S. Department of the Treasury today designated six members of the notorious El Salvadoran gang Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13) pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 13581, which targets transnational criminal organizations (TCOs) and their supporters. Today's actions, supported extensively by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's (ICE) Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), are part of the Treasury Department's ongoing efforts to target the leadership of global criminal organizations, including MS-13, that threaten innocent people and legitimate business around the world, including in the United States. In October 2012, MS-13 became the first transnational criminal street gang to be designated by Treasury as a TCO. MS-13 has been involved in serious criminal activity, in the United States and around the world, including human smuggling, sex trafficking, drug trafficking, kidnapping, murder, assassinations, racketeering, blackmail, extortion, and immigration offenses.

"MS-13 is an extremely violent and dangerous gang responsible for a multitude of crimes that directly threaten the welfare and security of U.S. citizens, as well as peoples throughout Central America," said Adam Szubin, Director of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control. "We will continue to target the leadership and financial networks supporting MS-13, and work with our law enforcement partners from across the United States and around the world to disrupt their criminal activities."

"Today's designation of six MS-13 leaders is the result of Homeland Security Investigation's National Gang Unit and OFAC's joint partnership to further strike at the financial heart of one of the most dangerous transnational criminal gangs in the world today," said ICE Director John Morton. "This powerful tool will provide HSI and its local, state, federal and international law enforcement partners to further disrupt MS-13 financial networks and violent operations. "History has proven that we can successfully take down organized crime groups when we combine sophisticated investigative techniques with tough street level enforcement, cutting off cash flows, contraband and collaborators to ensure they no longer find safe haven in our communities."

Today's designations of six individuals working for or on behalf of MS-13 are designed to further disrupt the activities of MS-13 and to protect the U.S. and international financial system from abuse. As active members and leaders, these individuals are heavily involved in directing and participating in illicit activity, such as drug trafficking, money laundering, extortion, and murder. Borromeo Enrique Henriquez Solorzano, incarcerated in El Salvador, is widely regarded as the Central American leader of the group and frequently acts as the spokesperson for the MS-13 gang in El Salvador. Several other MS-13 leaders, including Marvin Geovanny Monterrosa Larios, Moises Humberto Rivera Luna, and Saul Antonio Turcios Angel, have been indicted in the United States for racketeering, murder, and other violent crimes. Moris Alexander Bercian Manchon has been involved in narcotics trafficking operations on behalf of the organization and Jose Misael Cisneros Rodriguez is both an MS-13 crime boss and a narcotics trafficker.

MS-13 consists of more than 30,000 members and operates in at least five countries, including the United States. It is one of the most dangerous criminal gangs in the world today. MS-13 promotes its illicit interests through murder, kidnapping, blackmail, extortion, and assassination, including carrying out numerous murders within the United States.

U.S. persons and businesses are generally prohibited from engaging in any transactions with the individuals designated today, and any assets of those designees subject to U.S. jurisdiction are frozen.

US Department of the Treasury Press Release

February 05, 2013 - Treasury Targets Money Laundering Operation Linked to Los Zetas

The U.S. Department of the Treasury today announced the designation of Filemon Garcia Ayala, and two of his companies located in Mexico pursuant to the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act (Kingpin Act) for their links to Los Zetas, the violent Mexican drug cartel. In addition to the entities located in Mexico, Treasury is also identifying three U.S. companies affiliated with Filemon Garcia Ayala as blocked property pursuant to the Kingpin Act. Today’s action prohibits U.S. persons from conducting financial or commercial transactions with these designees, and also freezes any assets they may have under U.S. jurisdiction.

Filemon Garcia Ayala is a Mexican national who leads a money laundering network that makes large international transfers on behalf of Los Zetas. In June 2012, Mexican authorities sought to arrest Garcia Ayala on money laundering charges, but he fled and remains a fugitive.

“By exposing another key money operation tied to Los Zetas, Treasury is depriving the Zetas of an important avenue to launder their narco-dollars,” said Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control Director Adam J. Szubin. “We will continue to target individuals and businesses linked to Los Zetas and take any action necessary to protect the U.S. financial system from their illicit financial dealings.”

Treasury is designating two of Filemon Garcia Ayala’s companies located in Mexico, Prodira Casa de Cambio S.A. de C.V. and Trastreva S.A. de C.V., both located in Zacatecas, Mexico. OFAC is also identifying the following U.S. companies as blocked property due to Filemon Garcia Ayala’s interest in them: Prodira S.A. de C.V., incorporated in Texas; Prodira, Inc., which is currently incorporated in Arizona, Colorado, Iowa, and Texas; and Internacional & Nacional Exchange Services Inc., which is incorporated in Texas.

The President identified Los Zetas as a significant foreign narcotics trafficker pursuant to the Kingpin Act in April 2009. On July 24, 2011, the President identified Los Zetas as a significant Transnational Criminal Organization in the Annex to Executive Order 13581 (Blocking Property of Transnational Criminal Organizations).

Today’s action is part of ongoing efforts pursuant to the Kingpin Act to apply financial measures against significant foreign narcotics traffickers and their organizations worldwide. The Treasury Department has designated more than 1,200 individuals and entities pursuant to the Kingpin Act since June 2000. Penalties for violations of the Kingpin Act range from civil penalties of up to $1.075 million per violation to more severe criminal penalties. Criminal penalties for corporate officers may include up to 30 years in prison and fines up to $5 million. Criminal fines for corporations may reach $10 million. Other individuals face up to 10 years in prison and fines pursuant to Title 18 of the United States Code for criminal violations of the Kingpin Act.

January 23, 2013 - The U.S. Department of the Treasury today took action against three transnational criminal organizations (TCO), the Camorra, the Yakuza, and the Brothers’ Circle

Today’s designations include four members of the Camorra, one of Europe's largest criminal organizations; the Inagawa-kai, the third-largest clan within the Japanese Yakuza criminal network; and an individual providing support to a key member of the Brothers’ Circle, a large multi-ethnic Eurasian criminal network. These designations were imposed under Treasury’s authority targeting transnational organized crime.

President Obama identified the Camorra, the Yakuza, and the Brothers’ Circle along with the Zetas, as significant TCOs in the Annex to Executive Order 13581 (Blocking Property of Transnational Criminal Organizations) on July 24, 2011, and charged the Treasury Department with pursuing additional sanctions against its members and supporters to undermine and interdict their global criminal operations.

Today’s action freezes any assets these persons may have within the jurisdiction of the United States and generally prohibits any transactions with them by U.S. persons.

“The individuals designated today are key members of criminal organizations who engage in serious crimes around the world,” said David S. Cohen, Treasury Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence. “Treasury will continue to target additional members and supporters of these groups, as well as other significant TCOs, as we systematically expose their criminal operations and protect the U.S. financial system from their illicit activity.”

The Camorra

The Camorra operates internationally and is involved in serious criminal activity, such as money laundering, extortion, alien smuggling, robbery, blackmail, kidnapping, political corruption, and counterfeiting. In 2012 Italian law enforcement conducted multiple operations to seize Camorra assets, including 800 million euro seized from the Casalesi clan in July. To date, Treasury has identified five individuals affiliated with the Camorra under E.O. 13581, including their most prominent leaders Michele Zagaria and Antonio Iovine.

In August 2012 the Treasury Department designated Michele Zagaria, a leader of the Camorra Casalesi clan, who is serving a life sentence for conspiracy, murder, extortion, and robbery. The Camorra members designated today are all members of the immediate family of Michele Zagaria: his brothers Pasquale Zagaria, Carmine Zagaria, Antonio Zagaria, and his father Nicola Zagaria. Each of these four individuals is designated for acting for or on behalf of, or providing support to, Michele Zagaria and/or the Camorra. All the brothers have led the Caselasi clan at one point while other siblings were serving jail sentences. All are involved in the family’s criminal enterprises. This network has been involved in extortion, kidnapping, money laundering, and bribery.

The Yakuza

The Yakuza, reputedly the world’s largest criminal organization with over 70,000 members, is involved in serious criminal activities, including weapons trafficking, prostitution, human trafficking, drug trafficking, fraud, and money laundering. The Treasury Department designated the Yamaguchi-gumi and the Sumiyoshi-kai, in February and September 2012, respectively. The Inagawa-kai, designated today, is the third-largest of the Yakuza organizations, and the Department of the Treasury is targeting it today for acting for or on behalf of the Yakuza. The top three clans account for approximately 72.4 percent of the Yakuza membership. To date, Treasury has identified four individuals and two entities affiliated with the Yakuza under E.O. 13581, including their most prominent leaders Kenichi Shinoda and Shigeo Nishiguchi.

Today’s action also imposes sanctions on Jiro Kiyota, the top Inagawa-kai leader, as well as the Inagawa-kai’s second-in-command, Kazuo Uchibori, for acting for or on behalf of the Inagawa-kai. As leaders of Inagawa-kai, Kiyota and Uchibori play key roles in directing the syndicate’s policies and settling disputes with other Yakuza syndicates. Under the leadership of Kiyota and Uchibori, the Inagawa-kai has become increasingly aligned with the Yamaguchi-gumi.

The Brothers’ Circle

The Brothers’ Circle is a multi-ethnic criminal group composed of leaders and senior members of several Eurasian criminal groups largely based in countries of the former Soviet Union but extending to Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America. To date, Treasury has identified 15 individuals affiliated with the Brothers’ Circle and their associates under E.O. 13581, including their most prominent members Gafur Rakhimov and Zakhariy Kalashov. The Brothers’ Circle serves as a coordinating body for several national level criminal networks, mediating disputes between the individual criminal networks and directing global criminal activity.

On December 20, 2012, the Treasury Department designated Zakhariy Kalashov, a key member of the Brothers’ Circle and a prominent Eurasian organized crime figure with extensive connections to criminal groups in Russia and countries throughout Eurasia. His criminal activities include money laundering, extortion, criminal protection, and drug trafficking. He is currently incarcerated, serving a nine year sentence for money laundering in Spain. Marina Kalashova, who has been designated today, is a key part of Zakhariy Kalashov’s network. Kalashov communicates with Kalashova to pass messages on his behalf to his organization.

December 20, 2012 - Treasury Designates Key Members of the Brothers' Circle Criminal Organization

The U.S. Department of the Treasury today designated another key member of the Eurasian crime syndicate, the Brothers’ Circle, as well as two criminal associates of an individual who was previously designated for operating on behalf of the organization. These designations were made pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 13581, which targets entities or individuals determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Attorney General and the Secretary of State, to be significant transnational criminal organizations (TCOs) or to have links to such organizations. The Brothers’ Circle is one of five TCOs sanctioned under E.O. 13581, along with the Camorra, the Yakuza, Los Zetas, and MS-13. Over the past year, the Treasury Department has designated 12 individuals associated with the Brothers’ Circle.

Today’s action targets Zakhariy Kalashov for acting for or on behalf of, or providing material support to, the Brothers’ Circle, as well as Almanbet Anapiyaev and Adilet Kasenov, for acting for or on behalf of, or providing material support to, Kamychbek Kolbayev, who was designated under E.O. 13581 on February 23, 2012. Kolbayev had previously been designated under the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act on June 1, 2011. Kolbayev is currently in custody in Kyrgyzstan.

“This action further illuminates the Brothers’ Circle illicit network, and will help squeeze them out of the global financial system and protect the U.S. financial system from the group’s laundering of its criminal proceeds. We will continue to pursue members and supporters of the Brothers’ Circle, and today’s action against the group’s leadership will help us cast an even larger net to expose their financial facilitators and associates wherever they operate,” said Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence David S. Cohen.

President Obama identified the Brothers’ Circle as a significant TCO in the Annex to E.O. 13581 on July 24, 2011, and charged the Treasury Department with pursuing additional sanctions against its members and supporters. Today’s action freezes any assets the designees may have within the jurisdiction of the United States and prohibits any transactions with them by U.S. persons. These efforts protect the U.S. financial system from transnational criminal organizations and expose and disrupt the actions of individuals who are supporting or acting for or on behalf of the Brothers’ Circle.

The Brothers' Circle is a criminal group composed of leaders and senior members of several Eurasian criminal groups that are largely based in countries of the former Soviet Union, but also operate in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America. The Brothers' Circle serves as a coordinating body for several criminal networks, mediates disputes between the individual criminal networks, and directs member criminal activity globally.

Zakhariy Kalashov is a key member of the Brothers’ Circle. He is a prominent Eurasian organized crime figure and close associate of Lasha Shushanashvilli, who was also designated under E.O. 13581 on June 6, 2012. He has extensive connections to criminal groups in Russia and countries throughout Eurasia. According to law enforcement authorities, his criminal activities include money laundering, extortion, criminal protection, and trafficking in both arms and drugs. In June 2005, Kalashov escaped a Spanish police operation and fled to the United Arab Emirates (UAE), where he was arrested in 2006. After being extradited by the UAE to Spain, a Spanish court sentenced Kalashov to a 9-year prison term and imposed a 22.5 million Euro fine on him.

Almanbet Anapiyaev is a key associate of Kamchybek Kolbayev. Anapiyaev has been described as the deputy and “muscle” of Kolbayev’s criminal organization. A former police officer in Kyrgyzstan, Anapiyaev was fired for his ties to organized crime. Currently, Anapiyaev is subject to an Interpol Red Notice, a Kyrgyzstani arrest warrant, and he has been named to Kyrgyzstan’s Most Wanted List for kidnapping, illegal confinement, and robbery.

Adilet Kasenov is an active member of Kamchybek Kolbayev’s criminal organization, serving as treasurer and as Kolbayev’s bodyguard. Kasenov reportedly also serves as the “criminal governor” of the Issyk-Kul region of Kyrgyzstan. Kyrgyzstan has named Kasenov to its Most Wanted List for using violence against a government official, as well as for the illegal sale and possession of firearms and explosive devices. Kasenov is currently in custody in Kyrgyzstan.

October 11, 2012 - Specially Designated Nationals Update

Transnational Criminal Organizations Designation

September 27, 2012 - Actions Target the Second-Largest Clan within the Japanese Yakuza Criminal Network for Activities Including Human Trafficking The U.S. Department of the Treasury today announced the designation of the Sumiyoshi-kai, the second-largest clan within the Japanese Yakuza criminal network, and two of its leaders. This group and individuals are being designated by the Treasury Department pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 13581, which targets significant transnational criminal organizations (TCOs) and their supporters.

President Obama identified the Yakuza as a significant TCO in the Annex to E.O. 13581 of July 24, 2011. Since then, the Treasury Department has targeted the Yakuza by designating the Yamaguchi-gumi (the largest and most prominent of the Yakuza’s crime families) and two of its leaders.

“Through this action, we will continue to work toward disrupting the criminal activities of the Yakuza and dismantling its financial network,” said Treasury Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence David S. Cohen. “Today’s designation of the Sumiyoshi-kai also supports the Administration’s intensified efforts to combat trafficking in persons given the Yakuza’s long-standing involvement in sex trafficking throughout Asia.”

Today, the Treasury Department is continuing to target this criminal group and disrupt its activities by identifying another key Yakuza organization and its leaders, freezing any assets they may have within the jurisdiction of the United States and prohibiting any transactions with them by U.S. persons. These efforts are designed to protect the U.S. financial system from the malign influence of transnational criminal organizations and expose the individuals who are supporting or acting on behalf of the Yakuza.

The Yakuza and its crime clans, including the Sumiyoshi-kai, are involved in serious criminal activities, including weapons trafficking, prostitution, human trafficking, drug trafficking, fraud, and money laundering. The Sumiyoshi-kai is the second-largest and most prominent of the Yakuza organizations, and the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) is targeting it today for acting for or on behalf of the Yakuza.

Today’s action also imposes sanctions on Shigeo Nishiguchi, the top Sumiyoshi-kai leader as well as the Sumiyoshi-kai’s deputy, Hareaki Fukuda, both for acting for or on behalf of the Sumiyoshi-kai. As leaders of the Sumiyoshi-kai, both Nishiguchi and Fukuda play key roles in directing the syndicate’s policies and settling disputes with other Yakuza syndicates.

August 01, 2012 - Transnational Criminal Organizations Designations - Treasury Sanctions Members of the Camorra

The U.S. Department of the Treasury today designated five key leaders of the Camorra, one of Europe's largest criminal organizations, under its authority to impose sanctions targeting transnational organized crime. The Camorra is involved in money laundering, extortion, alien smuggling, robbery, blackmail, kidnapping, political corruption, and counterfeiting around the world. It is one of four transnational criminal organizations (TCOs) specifically identified by the President for sanctions under E.O. 13581 (Blocking Property of Transnational Criminal Organizations), along with the Brothers’ Circle, the Yakuza, and the Zetas. The Camorra leaders designated today are Antonio Iovine, Michele Zagaria, Mario Caterino, Paolo Di Mauro, and Giuseppe Dell’Aquila, all leaders or senior members of Camorra clans. Each of these five individuals is designated for acting for or on behalf of, or providing support to, the Camorra.

President Obama identified the Camorra as a significant TCO in the Annex to E.O. 13581 on July 24, 2011, and charged the Treasury Department with pursuing additional sanctions against its members and supporters. Drawing on this authority, the Treasury Department is taking action against the Camorra by identifying and designating these five key leaders. Today’s action freezes any assets they may have within the jurisdiction of the United States and prohibits any transactions with them by U.S. persons. These efforts protect the U.S. financial system from transnational criminal organizations and expose and disrupt the actions of individuals who are supporting or acting for or on behalf of the Camorra.

“This action is designed to squeeze the Camorra out of the global financial system and protect the U.S. financial system from laundering of its criminal proceeds. We will continue to pursue members and supporters of the Camorra, and today’s action against the group’s leadership will help us cast an even larger net to expose their financial facilitators and associates wherever they may operate,” said Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence David S. Cohen.

The Camorra operates internationally and is involved in serious criminal activity, such as counterfeiting and narcotics trafficking. In March 2012 more than a billion dollars worth of Camorra assets reportedly were seized by Italian law enforcement.

Mario Caterino is a Camorra clan leader, identified at the time of his arrest in May 2011 as the second in command of the Casalesi clan. He is serving a life sentence in Italy for conspiracy and murder.

Giuseppe Dell’Aquila is described as the head of the Mallardo clan. He is believed to have played a key role in investing in and managing Camorra holding companies. Arrested in Italy in May 2011, he is serving a sentence for conspiracy, money laundering, robbery, and the receipt of stolen goods.

Paolo di Mauro was the third most wanted fugitive in Italy at the time of his arrest in Spain in January 2010. He is a leader of the Contini clan and is currently serving a 17-year sentence for conspiracy and murder.

Antonio Iovine is a leader of the Camorra’s Casalesi clan. He was arrested in November 2010 and is serving a life sentence for conspiracy and murder.

Michele Zagaria is a leader of the Casalesi clan and was captured by Italian authorities in December 2011 after 15 years as a fugitive. He is serving a life sentence for conspiracy, murder, extortion, and robbery.

July 24, 2012 - Treasury Targets Corporate Network of Sinaloa Cartel Drug Lord "El Azul"

The U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) today announced the designation of nine entities and 10 individuals linked to Juan Jose Esparragoza Moreno (a.k.a. El Azul), a leader of Mexico’s Sinaloa Cartel. El Azul has used proceeds from his involvement in the narcotics trade to build a large network of businesses including a housing development, a shopping mall, and an industrial park. These businesses are operated by members of his network including his family. Today’s action, taken pursuant to the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act (Kingpin Act), prohibits U.S. persons from conducting financial or commercial transactions with these entities and individuals, and also freezes any assets they may have under U.S. jurisdiction.

“While other Mexican narcotics traffickers have garnered and in some cases sought more attention, Esparragoza Moreno has purposely kept a low profile hoping to avoid scrutiny while increasing his influence and ill-gotten gains,” said Treasury’s OFAC Director Adam J. Szubin. “Today’s action shines the spotlight on this godfather of Mexican narcotics. His entire corporate network that was created with illicit drug proceeds is in our sights.”

The President identified Esparragoza Moreno and the Sinaloa Cartel as significant foreign narcotics traffickers pursuant to the Kingpin Act in 2003 and 2009, respectively. Esparragoza Moreno was indicted on drug trafficking charges in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas in 2003. He is wanted in both the U.S. and Mexico – the U.S. State Department Narcotics Rewards Program is offering a reward of up to $5 million for information leading to Esparragoza Moreno’s arrest and/or conviction while Mexican authorities are offering 30 million pesos for information leading to his capture. Esparragoza Moreno has been active in drug trafficking since the 1970s.

Today’s action targets 10 individuals, including six family members of Esparragoza Moreno. Maria Guadalupe Gastelum Payan, one of Esparragoza Moreno’s wives, owns property in Tlajomulco de Zuniga, a town near Guadalajara, on behalf of Esparragoza Moreno. Gastelum Payan and her four children with Esparragoza Moreno own and operate the companies Grupo Cinjab, S.A. de C.V. and Grupo Impergoza, S.A. de C.V. in order to manage the aforementioned property, where they developed a residential community named Provenza Residencial and a shopping mall named Provenza Center. In addition, Grupo Impergoza, S.A. de C.V. also manages La Tijera Parque Industrial, an industrial park.

The four children of Esparragoza Moreno and Gastelum Payan who were designated today are: Brenda Guadalupe, Cristian Ivan, Juan Ignacio, and Nadia Patricia Esparragoza Gastelum. Juvencio Ignacio Gonzalez Parada, who plays a key role in Grupo Cinjab, S.A. de C.V. and Grupo Impergoza, S.A. de C.V., was also designated today. The final Esparragoza Moreno family member designated today is Ofelia Monzon Araujo, also a wife of Esparragoza Moreno. She and three other individuals designated today – Elvira Araujo Monzon, Ulises Guzman Ochoa, and Martin Humberto Ponce Felix – own and/or control the following seven gas station companies located in Culiacan, Sinaloa on behalf of Esparragoza Moreno: Buenos Aires Servicios, S.A. de C.V., Estaciones de Servicios Canarias, S.A. de C.V., Gasodiesel y Servicios Ancona, S.A. de C.V., Gasolinera Alamos Country, S.A. de C.V., Gasolinera y Servicios Villabonita, S.A. de C.V., Petrobarrancos, S.A. de C.V., and Servicios Chulavista, S.A. de C.V.

Today’s action would not have been possible without the support of the Drug Enforcement Administration.

Internationally, OFAC has designated more than 1,100 businesses and individuals linked to 97 drug kingpins since June 2000. Penalties for violations of the Kingpin Act range from civil penalties of up to $1.075 million per violation to more severe criminal penalties. Criminal penalties for corporate officers may include up to 30 years in prison and fines up to $5 million. Criminal fines for corporations may reach $10 million. Other individuals could face up to 10 years in prison and fines pursuant to Title 18 of the United States Code for criminal violations of the Kingpin Act.

February 23, 2012 - Transnational Criminal Organizations - Treasury Imposes Sanctions On Key Members Of The Yakuza And Brothers’ Circle Criminal Organizations

The U.S. Department of the Treasury today designated seven key members and associates of the Brothers' Circle crime syndicate as well as the largest group within the Japanese Yakuza, the Yamaguchi-gumi, and two Yamaguchi-gumi leaders. These are the first designations by Treasury pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 13581, which President Obama issued in 2011 to target and disrupt significant transnational criminal organizations (TCOs).

President Obama identified the Brothers' Circle and the Yakuza as significant TCOs in the Annex to E.O. 13581 (Blocking Property of Transnational Criminal Organizations) of July 24, 2011, and charged the Treasury Department with pursuing additional sanctions against their members and supporters. Drawing on this authority, the Treasury Department today is identifying key members and associates of these transnational organized criminal networks, freezing any assets the designated persons may have within the jurisdiction of the United States and prohibiting any transactions with them by U.S. persons.

"Today's action casts a spotlight on key members of criminal organizations that have engaged in a wide range of serious crimes across the globe," said David S. Cohen, Treasury Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence. "We will continue to work with our international partners to target those who deal in violence, narcotics, money laundering, and the exploitation of women and children. Today's designations are just the first under our new our sanctions authority to target transnational criminal organizations and isolate them from the global financial system."

THE BROTHERS' CIRCLE The Brothers' Circle (f.k.a. Family of Eleven; f.k.a. The Twenty) is a multi-ethnic criminal group composed of leaders and senior members of several Eurasian criminal groups largely based in countries of the former Soviet Union but operating in Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Latin America. The Brothers' Circle serves as a coordinating body for several criminal networks, mediating disputes between the individual criminal networks and directing member criminal activity globally.

The individuals designated today represent criminal syndicates that operate throughout Eurasia and the Gulf, specifically within Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Russia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). They include key Brothers' Circle members Vladislav Leontyev, Vasiliy Khristoforov, Kamchybek Kolbayev and Gafur Rakhimov. Lazar Shaybazyan, Aleksandr Manuylov and Aleksey Zaytsev are designated today based on their support to Vladislav Leontyev. Several of these individuals reside in Dubai, UAE.

Two key Brothers' Circle members, Vladislav Leontyev and Vasiliy Khristoforov, are targeted today for acting for or on behalf of the Brothers' Circle. Both have been involved in criminal activities, including narcotics trafficking, and were involved in a shooting between regional factions within Russian organized criminal networks over an attempt to seize control of a local precious metals enterprise. Leontyev is currently wanted by Russian authorities for illegal transactions involving precious metals and narcotics.

Kamchybek Kolbayev acts for or on behalf of the Brothers' Circle by serving as the Brothers' Circle "overseer" for its Central Asian activities, including narcotics trafficking. In June 2011, President Obama identified Kolbayev as a significant foreign narcotics trafficker under the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act. Kolbayev is wanted in Kyrgyzstan for organized crimes and crimes involving the use of weapons/explosives, and organized/transnational crime.

As a key member of the Brothers' Circle, Gafur Rakhimov acts for or on behalf of the Brothers' Circle. Rakhimov is one of the leaders of Uzbek organized crime with a specialty in the organized production of drugs in the countries of Central Asia. He has operated major international drug syndicates involving the trafficking of heroin.

Aleksey Zaytsev, who acts for or on behalf of the Brothers' Circle key member Vladislav Leontyev, is involved in fraud and a variety of other such activities as fraud, including his 2008 participation in a financial pyramid scheme involving the St. Petersburg-based Business Club Rubin.

Lazar Shaybazyan and Aleksandr Manuylov also act for or on behalf of, Brothers' Circle key member Vladislav Leontyev.

The YAKUZA

The Yakuza (a.k.a. Boryokudan; a.k.a. Gokudo) was listed in the Annex to E.O. 13581 for its involvement in serious criminal activities, including weapons trafficking, prostitution, human trafficking, drug trafficking, fraud and money laundering. The Yamaguchi-gumi is the largest and most prominent of the Yakuza's crime families, and is being designated today for acting for or on behalf of the Yakuza. The Yamaguchi-gumi has a pyramid structure with a kumicho ("godfather") at the top. Today's action also imposes sanctions on Kenichi Shinoda, the Yamaguchi-gumi kumicho since August 2005, as well as the Yamaguchi-gumi's wakagashira ("deputy godfather"), Kiyoshi Takayama, both for acting for or on behalf of Yamaguchi-gumi.

As leaders of the Yamaguchi-gumi crime syndicate, both Shinoda and Takayama play key roles in directing the syndicate's policies and settling disputes with other Yakuza syndicates. The Yamaguchi-gumi is involved in criminal endeavors in Japan and abroad, including drug trafficking, human trafficking, extortion, prostitution, fraud and money laundering. The Yamaguchi-gumi is estimated to generate billions of dollars annually in illicit proceeds.

Today's action is designed to protect the integrity of the U.S. financial system, to prevent U.S. financial institutions from being used unwittingly to facilitate the unlawful activities of these groups, and to deny the named individuals and entity access to the U.S. economy.

Overview

July 25, 2011 - President Obama has signed an Executive Order imposing sanctions against significant transnational criminal organizations (TCO's).

As a result of this Order, any property in the United States or in the possession or control of U.S. persons in which the significant TCO's listed in the Annex have an interest is blocked, and U.S. persons are prohibited from engaging in transactions with them.

The Order also authorizes the U.S. Department of the Treasury, in consultation with the Departments of Justice and State, to identify for sanctions any individual or entity determined to have materially assisted, sponsored or provided financial, material or technological support for any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this Order.

The US encourage partners and allies to echo the commitment and join in building a new framework for international cooperation to protect all our citizens from the violence, harm and exploitation wrought by transnational organized crime.

In signing today’s Order, the President imposed sanctions on the following organizations listed - Executive Order

Name AKA / FKA Main Location Description Remarks
The Brothers’ Circle f.k.a. FAMILY OF ELEVEN; f.k.a. THE TWENTY Eurasia / former Soviet Union States The Brothers’ Circle is a multi-ethnic criminal group composed of leaders and senior members of several Eurasian criminal groups largely based in countries of the former Soviet Union but extending to the Middle East, Africa and Latin America. Many Brothers’ Circle members share a common ideology based on the “thief-in-law” tradition, which seeks to spread their brand of criminal influence globally. The Brothers’ Circle serves as a coordinating body for several national level criminal networks, which includes mediating disputes between the individual criminal networks and directing global criminal activity.
Camorra Italian Mafia Italy Considered the largest Italian organized crime group, the Camorra is a loose collection of allied and competing local clans in the province of Naples and the Campania region of Italy. The Camorra operates internationally and is involved in serious criminal activity such as counterfeiting and narcotics trafficking. The Camorra may earn more than 10 percent of its roughly $25 billion annual profit through the sale of counterfeit and pirated goods – such as luxury clothing, power tools, CDs, DVDs, and software – in European and U.S. markets. The Camorra's counterfeiting and piracy activities undermine U.S. sales of genuine products and deny U.S. copyright holders of profits. The International Intellectual Property Alliance (IIPA), a private sector coalition of trade associations, estimates that copyright piracy causes trade losses with Italy of more than $1 billion every year. - August 01, 2012 Treasury Sanctions Members of the Camorra
Mara Salvatrucha MS-13 aka Mara aka MS El Salvador The Mara Salvatrucha gang originated in Los Angeles and has spread to Central America, other parts of the United States, and Canada. It is commonly abbreviated as MS, Mara, and MS-13. There is some dispute about the etymology of the name. The most common belief is that the word "Mara" refers to the Spanish word for "gang", and "Salvatrucha" (which is Spanish slang) for "Salvadoran army ant". Alternatively, it is suggested that "Salvatrucha" refers to the Salvadoran peasant guerrillas, the source of much of the gang's early manpower. The number 13 is homage to the Los Angeles gang "Los Emes" or "The Ms"(M being the thirteenth letter of the alphabet). The gang was set up in Los Angeles in 1980's by Salvadoran immigrants in the city's Pico-Union neighborhood.

Yakuza Japanese Mafia a.k.a. BORYOKUDAN; a.k.a. GOKUDO Japan The Yakuza comprises the major Japanese organized crime syndicates, sometimes referred to as “families,” and had more than 80,000 members as of 2008. The Yakuza derives most of its profits from the drug trade, particularly methamphetamine, the most widely abused drug in Japan. The Yakuza also profits from other serious criminal activities, including weapons trafficking and nearly all aspects of sexual exploitation: sex tourism, prostitution, human trafficking, “mail order” marriages, pornography, and the exploitation of women and children, with the help of local crime syndicates in East Asia. The Yakuza is also heavily involved in white-collar crime, often using front companies to hide illicit proceeds within legitimate industries, including construction, real estate and finance. In addition to its networks in Japan, the Yakuza acts globally. It has relationships with criminal affiliates in Asia, Europe and the Americas. In the United States, the Yakuza has been involved primarily in drug trafficking and money laundering.

YAMAGUCHI-GUMI Japanese Mafia a.k.a. ROKUDAIME YAMAGUCHI-GUMI; a.k.a. SIXTH YAMAGUCHI-GUMI Japan It is one of the largest criminal organizations in the world. Estimates put the number of active members at just over 55,000, with thousands more having strong associations. It is, by far, the largest of the boryokudan groups, and its membership encompasses roughly 45% of the 86,300 yakuza in the Japanese underworld. Formal members of the Yamaguchi-gumi number 102 people in total; 1 kumicho, 15 shatei (younger brother) and 86 wakachu (child) as of November 2005 (source Wikipedia)
Los Zetas Mexico Formerly the armed wing of the Gulf Cartel, Los Zetas is an extremely violent transnational criminal organization based primarily in Mexico. The organization is estimated to have thousands of members in Mexico, Central America and the United States. Los Zetas facilitates drug trafficking into the United States and has relationships with U.S.-based gangs. Los Zetas is specifically responsible for the safe passage of large quantities of illegal narcotics, including cocaine, methamphetamine, heroin and marijuana moving through Mexico and eventually into the United States. In addition to drug trafficking, Los Zetas is involved in extortion, money laundering, intellectual property theft and human smuggling. Los Zetas and Gulf Cartel members together are named in multiple indictments in Federal District courts for violating U.S. narcotics laws. These indictments allege that Los Zetas has carried out numerous acts of violence, including murders, kidnappings and tortures. - Los Zetas members are responsible for mass murders in Mexico and Guatemala, and have demonstrated their capacity and willingness to intimidate and brazenly kill law enforcement and other government personnel. In February 2011, Los Zetas members ambushed and killed Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Special Agent Jaime Zapata and seriously wounded ICE Agent Victor Avila. In April 2011, Mexico's Office of the Attorney General announced the arrest of Los Zetas cell leaders connected to the discovery of nearly 200 bodies dumped in mass graves in San Fernando, Tamaulipas, Mexico. The victims were kidnapped from passenger buses traveling toward the U.S.-Mexico border. In May 2011, Los Zetas members stormed a ranch in northern Guatemala and killed 27 people and later killed the Guatemalan prosecutor involved in the investigation of the murders.

August 29, 2012 - The Treasury Department targeted a Mexican oil services firm owned by Francisco Antonio Colorado Cessa, who it has already identified as a drug trafficker and is U.S. custody awaiting trial on money laundering charges. The action prohibits U.S. companies and individuals from doing business with ADT Petroservicios SA De C.V. and freezes any assets the company has under U.S. jurisdiction. OFAC Enforcement Action

The President identified Los Zetas as a significant foreign narcotics trafficker under the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act in 2009. The U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) has since designated four principal Los Zetas and Gulf Cartel leaders and 54 Mexican principal lieutenants and enforcers for Los Zetas and the Gulf Cartel pursuant to the Kingpin Act.​
