FORMER Minister of Health and Child Care David Parirenyatwa has been arrested on alleged criminal abuse of office charges.

Reports say the former top government official was arrested this Thursday morning and he is being questioned by the Criminal Investigations Department (CID)â€™s Serious Fraud Squad.

There was no immediate detail on what his offence was about although he was in 2015 accused of unprocedurally receiving some payment to the tune of US$100 000 through his private surgery by the Premier Service Medical Aid Society.

The then Minister allegedly pocketed money services for services he had not rendered through the struggling health insurer.

The Parirenyatwa insisted the transaction was above board as PSMAS had not paid him for services rendered to its affiliates for a long time.
