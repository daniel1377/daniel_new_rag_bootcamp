The U.S. Treasury Department said Wednesday it placed Kingpin Act sanctions on an alleged Colombian drug trafficker, along with seven other individuals and five entities supporting him.

Fernain Rodriguez Vasquez leads an international drug-trafficking and money laundering organization based in Colombia that exported nearly 100 tons of cocaine per year, Treasury said. He also managed the daily narcotics trafficking operations of Jorge Fadlallah Cheaitelly, who was placed under sanctions in December 2011, Treasury said.

"These sanctions will expose Rodriguez Vasquez's illicit network of agents and front companies and exclude them from the legitimate financial system," said Adam J. Szubin, director of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control in a statement.

In addition, Treasury placed sanctions on seven of Mr. Rodriguez Vasquez's associates, all of whom were indicted Feb. 14 in the Eastern District of Texas on drug-trafficking charges, Treasury said. As a result of arrest warrants and the indictment, Treasury said Colombian authorities arrested 11 people in August 2013, including Mr. Rodriguez Vasquez and four others targeted Wednesday with sanctions.

Those arrested were known to collaborate with the FARC rebels, as well as Mexico's Sinaloa and Zetas cartels, Treasury said. Mr. Rodriguez Vasquez utilized FARC to protect cocaine labs in Colombia and to escort drug loads, and he provided Zetas members with tons of cocaine, which was ultimately distributed in the U.S., Treasury said.
