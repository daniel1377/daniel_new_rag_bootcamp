The National Accountability Bureau (NAB) on Monday filed a corruption reference against former Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz in the accountability court.

The notice from the NAB stated that former federal minister for power and water Liaquat Jatoi, former secretary Ismail Qureshi, additional secretary Yousaf Memon and ex-secretary of Alternative Energy Development Board (AEDB), Dr Naseem A Khan, have also been nominated in the case, as reported by Geo News.

The reference was filed in connection with the alleged illegal appointment of Basharat Hasan Bashir as a consultant for one of the country's top alternative energy board on a Management Position-II (MP-II) scale salary package.

According to the Express Tribune, the ex-joint secretary of water and power, Ghulam Nabi Mangrio, ex-section officer of water and power, Umar Farooq and retired air marshal and former chairman of AEDB, Shahid Hamid, are also among the accused in the NAB reference.

Allegedly, Bashir was appointed as the consultant in 2006 without following prerequisite procedures. His appointment also violated MP scale policy guidelines.

"After the expiry of his consultancy contract in May 2008, the accused Basharat Hasan Bashir illegally held the said post for almost 5 years without any extension, notification or regular appointment and kept on enjoying salary and all perks and privileges illegally in connivance with the management of AEDB," the NAB stated in the reference.
