WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. Treasury has named five mob bosses in Italy's Camorra organized crime family so they are banned from banking or doing business in America.

The Treasury Department on Wednesday also identified two businesses linked to the Brothers' Circle multi-ethnic criminal organization.

Treasury's name-and-ban campaign has included Japan's Yakuza, the Zetas in Mexico, and the MS-13 gang that operates from Central America.

The alleged Camorra figures are mob boss Marco Di Lauro; fugitive drug trafficker Mario Riccio; imprisoned assassin/enforcer Antonio Mennetta; jailed drug conspirator Mariano Abete; and Rosario Guarino, who is under arrest and implicated in a dozen murders.

The Brothers' Circle is based in Eastern Europe but has worldwide influence. Treasury named two companies -- Avuar OOO and Guga Arm SRO -- as part of the group.
