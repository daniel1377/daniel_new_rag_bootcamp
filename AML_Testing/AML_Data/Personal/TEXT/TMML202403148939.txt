As Commerce Secretary, Wilbur Ross may have a lower profile than some of Donald Trump’s other cabinet secretaries, but he is no less corrupt and unqualified for his position.

Ross has invested heavily in and even served as Vice Chair of Bank of Cyprus, known for its connections to Russian money laundering and oligarchs.

He has business ties to Vladimir Putin’s inner circle; Ross’ investment firm has a 31.5% stake in a British ship-charter company, whose client is a Russian energy giant owned by Putin’s son-in-law and friend. Ross’ investment firm raised $500 million from the Chinese government.

Ross, who made much of his $700 million net worth from selling U.S. steel companies to foreign firms, did not pay for his steel workers’ pensions or retirees’ health care costs. He also left $2 billion in assets off of his financial disclosure form.
