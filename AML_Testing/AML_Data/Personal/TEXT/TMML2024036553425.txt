Ex-Labour minister Elliot Morley has admitted dishonestly claiming more than Â£30,000 in parliamentary expenses, the largest sum of any former MP.

He pleaded guilty to making excessive claims for mortgage costs between 2004 and 2007 and pocketing cash for another loan that had been paid off.

Morley stepped down as an MP at the last election, having represented Scunthorpe since 1987.
