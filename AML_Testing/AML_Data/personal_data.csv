CRIMINAL EXECUTIVE OFFICER
Sam Waksal

CEO: ImClone
Convicted: October 15, 2002 of securities fraud, bank fraud, obstruction of justice, and perjury
Known for his networking skills as much as for his scientific expertise, immunologist Sam Waksal founded ImClone in 1984. The New York-based biotech firm remained relatively unknown until 1999, when it announced the creation of Erbitux — a cancer-fighting drug so promising it convinced pharmaceutical giant Bristol-Myers to purchase $1 billion of ImClone stock in one of the largest biotechnology partnerships in U.S. history. But when the Food and Drug Administration rejected the drug, Waksal alerted several relatives and friends to dump their stock as soon as possible — before the FDA's decision had been made public. Waksal's father and daughter sold $9.2 million worth of ImClone, a move that caught the attention of the SEC and eventually led to his arrest.
Though Waksal pleaded guilty and publicly apologized to his family, his colleagues, and the millions of cancer patients who had held such high hopes for Erbitux, Judge William Pauley dismissed calls for leniency, noting that Waksal had contributed a mere one-half of 1 percent of his $133 million fortune to charity. In the end, the fallen entrepreneur paid $4.3 million in fines and tax restitution, and served 87 months in prison; he was released on Feb. 9, 2009. The scandal's most infamous casualty, however, turned out to be Waksal's pal, Martha Stewart, who had unloaded all 3,928 of her company shares just days before the FDA's decision had been announced to avoid losing an estimated $45,673; the domestic diva got five months in prison as a result.",fraud

One of the world's leading fund managers has been forced to resign after the BBC discovered he had broken investment rules.

Mark Denning helped to manage more than $300bn (£229bn; €265bn) of investors' money at Capital Group.

BBC One's Panorama uncovered evidence that suggests he was secretly acquiring shares for his own benefit in some of the same companies as his funds.

Mr Denning, who had worked at the firm for 36 years, denies any wrongdoing.

The 62-year-old fund manager left his job five days after Panorama wrote to Capital Group about the findings of its investigation.

Capital Group - which manages almost $2 trillion of assets - said Mr Denning was no longer with the firm.

""We have a Code of Ethics and personal investing disclosure requirements that hold our associates to the highest standards of conduct. When we learned of this matter, we took immediate action,"" it said.

Fund managers are not supposed to invest in the same companies as their funds, because they could potentially profit at the expense of investors.

This is because their size means the funds can drive up a company's share price when they invest. The fund manager could use this power to push up the share price in the companies where they have personal investments, rather than picking the companies that offer the best returns for investors.

Leaked documents

The Panorama investigation discovered that shares were bought on Mr Denning's instructions through a secretive fund based in Liechtenstein.

It was called Morebath Fund Global Opportunities.

Leaked documents show the Morebath fund had invested in a medical research company called Mesoblast, an Indian film company called Eros International and a gold mining company called Hummingbird Resources.

Capital Group funds also invested in all three companies, and the investments in Mesoblast and Eros were made by funds that Mr Denning himself helped to manage.

In the case of Hummingbird Resources, Mr Denning appeared to have another potential conflict of interest as the company was set up and run by his son-in-law.

An expert on the financial rules told Panorama that the private purchases by Mr Denning could represent a serious conflict of interest.

Michael Ruck, investigations partner at the law firm TLT, said: ""The whole point behind the regime, in relation to declaring conflicts of interest, is to protect investors.

""If there was an intention by the fund manager to financially benefit themselves, then that does raise serious concerns in relation to their actions.""

The stakes in the three companies were ultimately held through an offshore entity called the Kinrara Trust. It was set up and controlled by Mr Denning.

'Complied with duties'

Mr Denning's lawyers deny that he owns the shares in the three companies because they say he is not a beneficiary of the Kinrara Trust.

""Our client did not declare his interest in the Kinrara Trust to his former employers because he had been irrevocably excluded as a beneficiary. He believed that he had complied with all of his relevant duties.""

Mr Denning's lawyers say he received bad advice. They also say the Morebath fund had an independent asset manager and fund administrator.

However, Panorama has seen evidence that Mr Denning was behind the share purchases in the three companies and documents show the Morebath fund was regularly included in a summary of his personal assets.

Mr Denning appears to have named the Liechtenstein-based fund after the village of Morebath in North Devon. He owns a nine bedroom house, Morebath Manor, and 21 acres of parkland in the village.

The fund manager also owns luxury homes in Chelsea and the Bahamas.

Controversial energy deal

Mr Denning used to work for Capital Group in London and was approved by the City watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority until 2018.

However, four of the funds he managed were aimed at American investors and he had been working from the company's office in Los Angeles.

Panorama also discovered that the Kinrara Trust owned Kinrara International - a company that profited from a controversial energy deal in Senegal.

Kinrara International made $22m after the exploration rights to a huge gas field off the Senegalese coast were sold to BP.

Experts have told Panorama that they believe Mr Denning should also have declared this - because Capital Group had investments in BP and another company involved in the deal called Kosmos Energy.

Mr Denning's lawyers say he has never been a legal or beneficial owner of Kinrara International.",broke investment rules

The founder of US futures broker Peregrine Financial Group has pleaded guilty to a fraud involving 24,000 customers in the US state of Iowa.

The embezzlement, totalling over $100m (£61.5m), began some 20 years ago.

Russell Wasendorf Sr, who is 64, was once regarded as a noble figure who supported a range of institutions from health care to universities.

He now faces at least 24 years in jail. Prosecutors said: ""He has gone from being a hero... to a villain.""

In court, Wasendorf pleaded guilty to charges including mail fraud, embezzling customer funds and making false statements to two regulatory agencies.

Assets sold

In July he attempted suicide, writing a note that was found on his person confessing to the fraud.

The company he built up over 30 years is being dismantled by receivers who will attempt to refund some of the money taken from the 24,000-strong customer base.

Assets recently sold include a corporate jet and a publishing company which produced Wasendorf's books and magazines giving investment advice.

The receiver is also hoping to raise money from various properties including a restaurant, company headquarters that could be worth $20m and a 4,000-bottle wine collection.

Peregrine's customers invested mainly in commodities, including corn and gold.

They have not been able to access their accounts since the firm filed for bankruptcy in July but are expected to gain back an initial 30-40% of their investment in the coming weeks.

TMML202403479017,Charlie Shrem,"Alert ID: TMML202403479017
A senior figure in the Bitcoin Foundation, which lobbies on behalf of the digital currency has been arrested for conspiracy to commit money laundering and “knowingly contributing” to anonymous drug sales.

Prosecutors announced on Monday that Charlie Shrem, the organisation's vice chairman, was arrested at John F Kennedy airport in New York on New York Sunday.

The news comes as a major blow for the digital currency lobby group and its supporters including Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss. The twins, famous for the early involvement with Facebook, have become big backers of the digital currency. They said in a statement on Monday that they were “deeply concerned” by the news.

A second man, Robert Faiella, has also been arrested and charged for the same crimes relating to his operation of a small bitcoin exchange under the name BTCKing.

The charges, unsealed by the US attorney for the southern district of New York, Preet Bharara, accuse the pair of ""engaging in a scheme to sell over $1m in bitcoins to users of Silk Road"", the online black marketplace which was closed by the FBI in October 2013.

Shrem has been one of the highest profile executives on the Bitcoin Foundation. His arrest comes as staff at the foundation have been working hard to distance the digital currency from its links to crime, testifying to the US Senate last year and been lobbying regulators in Washington. Patrick Murck, Bitcoin’s general counsel, said: “I don’t think it’s damaging for the Foundation. [The] foundation wasn’t involved in any of the allegations.”

James Hunt, an agent at the US drug enforcement administration agent, said in a statement: ""The charges announced today depict law enforcement's commitment to identifying those who promote the sale of illegal drugs throughout the world. Hiding behind their computers, both defendants are charged with knowingly contributing to and facilitating anonymous drug sales, earning substantial profits along the way.""

The charges stem from Shrem's ownership of the BitInstant bitcoin exchange, of which he is the chief executive, co-founder and compliance officer. The exchange hit the headlines in May 2013 when the Winklevoss twins led a seed round which raised $1.5m of investment. The timing of the charges is unfortunate for the Winklevoss brothers who are set to speak this week at a two-day conference on digital currencies held by New York state's department of financial services.

In a statement the twins said: “When we invested in BitInstant in the fall of 2012, its management made a commitment to us that they would abide by all applicable laws – including money laundering laws – and we expected nothing less. Although BitInstant is not named in today’s indictment of Charlie Shrem, we are obviously deeply concerned about his arrest. We were passive investors in BitInstant and will do everything we can to help law enforcement officials. We fully support any and all governmental efforts to ensure that money laundering requirements are enforced, and look forward to clearer regulation being implemented on the purchase and sale of bitcoins.”

Shrem is additionally charged with ""wilfully failing to file any suspicious activity report regarding Faiella's illegal transactions through the company,"" the documents reveal.

“As alleged, Robert Faiella and Charlie Shrem schemed to sell over $1m in Bitcoins to criminals bent on trafficking narcotics on￼￼￼￼￼ the dark web drug site, Silk Road,"" said Bharara. ""Truly innovative business models don’t need to resort to old-fashioned law-breaking, and when bitcoins, like any traditional currency, are laundered and used to fuel criminal activity, law enforcement has no choice but to act. We will aggressively pursue those who would co-opt new forms of currency for illicit purposes.”

The substance of the allegation is that Faiella offered bitcoins for sale on the Silk Road website, a move which would entail knowing of their involvement in the drugs trade. Those bitcoins were purchased from the Bitinstant exchange.

Shrem, as the compliance officer of the exchange, was in charge of ensuring its compliance of anti-money laundering rules.

The charges, delivered by an IRS agent who was assigned to the New York organised crime drug enforcement strike force, allege that ""not only did Shrem knowingly allow Faiella to use the company's services to buy bitcoins for his Silk Road customers, he personally processed Faiella's transactions, gave Faiella discounts on his high-volume orders, wilfully failed to file suspicious activity reports about Faiella and deliberately helped Faiella circumvent the company's [anti-money-laundering] restrictions, even though it was Shrem's job to enforce them.""

In December 2013, Shrem was profiled by news website Vocativ in a piece titled "" My Night Out With Bitcoin Millionaire and Proud Stoner Charlie Shrem"". In it, Shrem tells reporter Eric Markowitz that ""I won’t hire you unless I drink with you or smoke weed with you"", and says that he was forced to temporarily close BitInstant several times due to increased regulatory scrutiny. ""If we want to exist 20 years from now, we want to make sure all of our ducks are in a row,” he tells Markowitz, “and right now, they’re not.""

The Winklevoss brothers' investment in BitInstant is just a small part of their total investment in bitcoin and related companies. Following the news of Shrem and Faiella's arrest, the price of bitcoin on the Mtgox exchange dropped by 3%.",arrested for money launering

Rohan Marley is not charged with wrongdoing. (Photo: AP)

Among recent enforcement actions, the Securities and Exchange Commission shut down a $78 million pump-and-dump scheme involving a coffee company with ties to the late reggae great Bob Marley.

In addition, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority fined Deutsche Bank Securities $1.4 million on short interest reporting failures and fined Signator Investors $450,000 for supervisory failures regarding consolidated reports.

SEC Investigating Pump-and-Dump of Marley Coffee Stock

The SEC charged several individuals in a pump-and-dump scheme involving the stock of the stock of Jammin’ Java, a company that operates as Marley Coffee and uses trademarks of late reggae artist Bob Marley to sell coffee products.

According to the agency, Jammin’ Java’s former CEO Shane Whittle put together the scheme with the aid of three individuals living abroad and the offshore entities they control. Whittle utilized a reverse merger to secretly gain control of millions of Jammin’ Java shares, and he spread the stock to the offshore entities controlled by Wayne Weaver of the U.K. and Canada, Michael Sun of India and René Berlinger of Switzerland.

Charged with fraudulently promoting Jammin’ Java stock to investors are British twin brothers Alexander and Thomas Hunter, who were previously charged in a separate SEC case for touting multiple penny stocks using a fake stock picking robot. Others charged in the SEC’s complaint with pushing the illegal offering through their offshore entities are U.K. citizens Stephen Wheatley and Kevin Miller and Oman resident Mohammed Al-Barwani.

Stock promoter Whittle befriended Rohan Marley — a son of Bob Marley — in Los Angeles. When he learned that Marley had bought a small Jamaican coffee farm, Whittle proposed the creation of a large-scale coffee distribution business built on the Marley name.

To raise capital for the venture, Whittle identified publicly traded shell company Global Electronic Recovery Corp. (GERC), which was a purported waste management business in Los Angeles. He executed a reverse merger between GERC and Marley Coffee, which later became Jammin’ Java and trades under the ticker symbol JAMN. In connection with the reverse merger, Whittle secretly gained control of millions of shares that previously had been issued to foreign nominees.

Using his access and control of Jammin’ Java and its stock, Whittle and others put together an illegal offering and the fraudulent promotion of Jammin’ Java’s stock in a pump-and-dump scheme that culminated in the middle of 2011. In anticipation of the promotion, Whittle distributed some of the nominee stock to offshore entities controlled by Weaver, Sun and Berlinger.

To boost the stock price and provide cash to Jammin’ Java, Whittle, Weaver, Sun and Berlinger created a fake financing arrangement to make it look as if there were legitimate third-party interest and investment in the company. Jammin’ Java’s announcement of the financing agreement and other company announcements, along with coordinated trading by entities connected to the scheme, boosted the stock price.

Whittle hid his control of the stock and other aspects of the scheme, lying in beneficial ownership reports that he filed with the SEC. He also distributed another large block of stock to offshore entities, including those controlled or owned by Weaver, Sun, Berlinger, Wheatley, Miller and Al-Barwani. Whittle, Weaver, Sun, and Berlinger hid their beneficial ownership of Jammin’ Java stock.

The Hunters published false stock newsletters and took other actions to raise the stock’s price; then, when the price was up, the defendants and others coordinating with them dumped 45 million shares on the public market without registering the transactions, making at least $78 million in illicit profits. Weaver, Sun and Berlinger funneled $2.5 million in profits to Jammin’ Java under the guise of the phony financing arrangement that launched the promotion.

Jammin’ Java’s share price and volume began to collapse a few days after the company disclosed on May 9, 2011, that it became aware of an unauthorized and unaffiliated online stock promotion. Disappointing financial results in its annual report took the price down even more.

Marley was not accused of wrongdoing.

Jammin’ Java, Whittle, Weaver, Sun, Berlinger, Wheatley, Miller, Al-Barwani and the Hunter brothers face various charges. The SEC is seeking injunctions, disgorgement, prejudgment interest and penalties as well as penny stock bars against all of the individuals and an officer-and-director bar against Whittle.

Deutsche Bank Securities Hit by FINRA for $1.4 Million

FINRA has fined Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. $1.4 million for violations of the short interest reporting rule and related supervisory failures.

According to the agency, for more than 10 years, Deutsche Bank has been improperly including securities positions of a non-U.S.-broker-dealer affiliate in numerous aggregation units when determining each unit’s net position.

Firms are generally allowed to track their positions in a security from certain trading operations or trading desks separately from other positions maintained at the firm through the use of an “aggregation unit.” But in determining the net positions of aggregation units, firms cannot include the securities positions of a non-U.S.-broker-dealer affiliate. In addition, FINRA requires firms, with some exceptions, to regularly report their total “short” positions in all customer and proprietary firm accounts in equity securities. These short positions must be reported on a gross, rather than a net basis.

But from April 2004 to September 2012, Deutsche Bank reported the netted positions in its financial aggregation account as the firm’s short interest positions for that particular day.

FINRA also found that, during the period when the violations occurred, Deutsche Bank’s supervisory system, with respect to its aggregation unit structure and short interest reporting, was not designed to detect and prevent them.

The firm neither admitted nor denied the charges, but consented to the sanctions.

FINRA Censures, Fines Signator Investors $450,000

FINRA censured Signator Investors Inc. and fined it $450,000 for supervisory failures regarding registered representatives’ use of consolidated reports. In addition, Gregory Joseph Mitchell was assessed a deferred fine of $10,000 and suspended from association with any FINRA member in any supervisory capacity for seven months.

According to the agency, Mitchell failed to enforce the firm’s policies and procedures related to client file reviews and branch audits by providing advance notice of which client files would be reviewed, as well as advance notice of unannounced branch audits to registered representatives. In addition, despite being reprimanded by the firm’s director of compliance for surveillance, Mitchell continued to notify registered representatives in advance which files would be reviewed, and the firm did nothing to stop him.

The firm made a consolidated reporting system available to its registered representatives that allowed the representatives to enter customized values for assets and accounts held away from the firm into a consolidated report. However, the firm not only lacked an adequate supervisory system to review those reports, including the accuracy of manually entered valuations provided to the customers, but its procedures never mentioned either supervising consolidated reports or how to use the system — in fact, there was no review process for consolidated reports; as a result, the firm’s supervisors didn’t even know who was responsible for reviewing the reports.

FINRA found other procedural failures, including failure to adequately review incoming and outgoing correspondence, failure to maintain consolidated reports that were sent to its customers and failures in its written supervisory procedures regarding its client file review and branch audit programs.",sanction against smn

A Colombian who was one of the top financial managers and supervised money-laundering for a cocaine cartel accused of smuggling $10 billion in drugs into the U.S. was sentenced Tuesday to 30 years in federal prison.

Eugenio Montoya Sanchez, 39, pleaded guilty in January to drug trafficking and obstruction of justice charges, the latter involving his role in setting up the torture, killing and dismemberment a cartel associate suspected of cooperating with authorities. In a brief statement, Montoya expressed remorse.

""There is no justification for what I did,"" Montoya said through a Spanish interpreter.

Montoya is the brother of the purported mastermind of Colombia's North Valley cartel. Diego Montoya Sanchez is also in U.S. custody in Miami and has pleaded not guilty to a 12-count federal indictment charging cocaine trafficking, money laundering, witness retaliation and obstruction of justice. Another brother, Juan Carlos Montoya Sanchez, is serving a 22-year prison sentence in the U.S. his role in the drug cartel.

The Montoyas are accused of overseeing a cocaine empire that smuggled cocaine into the U.S. beginning in the 1990s. U.S. District Judge Cecilia M. Altonaga set a July 10 hearing to consider whether Montoya can pay restitution to the U.S. government for his drug activities.

Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Davis said most of Montoya's assets have been seized by the Colombian government and that the additional time is needed to determine how much he could pay.

Eugenio Montoya, who has been cooperating with U.S. authorities, previously admitted his role as a top financial manager of the cartel. Among his duties was handling a series of so-called ""stash houses"" in Colombia where about $20 million in U.S. currency was hidden. Montoya also made numerous real estate investments and oversaw a computer equipment business.

Testified about torture
The obstruction charge stems from the August 2003 killing of Jhon Jairo Garcia Giraldo, known as ""Dos Mil,"" whose main job was handling pagers and cell phones for the Montoya organization. According to court documents, Garcia was tortured at a farm outside Cali, Colombia, on orders from Diego Montoya to find out if he had talked with U.S. officials during a visit to South Florida.

""Methods used included hitting Garcia Giraldo with baseball bats in the shins and other parts of the body, holding his head under water, and asphyxiating him with a plastic bag over his head,"" according to a statement of facts signed by Eugenio Montoya.

WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of the Treasury today designated 20 entities and one individual linked to Rafael Caro Quintero, a major Mexican narcotics trafficker and fugitive from U.S. justice for his role in the murder of an agent of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). Caro Quintero was identified as a significant foreign narcotics trafficker pursuant to the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act (Kingpin Act) in 2000. Each entity designated today is owned or controlled by one or more individuals previously designated because they act on behalf of Caro Quintero.

“Today’s designation demonstrates the enormous extent to which Rafael Caro Quintero and his family members have infiltrated the economy in Guadalajara, Mexico, including the real estate and gasoline retail sectors,” said Treasury’s Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) Adam J. Szubin. “With Caro Quintero on the run, OFAC will continue to work with the DEA and our Mexican counterparts to expand the sanctions against any person or entity that acts on behalf of this murderous criminal.”

Caro Quintero began his criminal career in the late 1970s when he co-founded the Guadalajara drug cartel and amassed an illicit fortune. Caro Quintero was the mastermind behind the kidnapping and murder of DEA Special Agent (SA) Enrique Camarena in 1985. Following his capture in the same year, Caro Quintero was convicted in Mexico for his involvement in SA Camarena’s murder and received a 40-year prison sentence. However, on August 9, 2013, Caro Quintero was released from a Mexican prison with 12 years remaining on his sentence.

“We are reminded every day of the ultimate sacrifice paid by Special Agent Enrique Camarena and DEA will vigorously continue its efforts to ensure Caro Quintero faces justice in the United States for the crimes he committed,” said DEA Administrator Michele M. Leonhart. “Caro Quintero and his organization can no longer hide behind front companies with their drug trafficking profits. These illegal enterprises fuel the drug trade and its violence and corruption. DEA and our partners at Treasury and elsewhere in government will pursue any and all means available to ensure that Caro Quintero is brought to justice and his criminal network is destroyed.”

While in prison, Caro Quintero continued his alliance with Mexican drug trafficking organizations and used a network of family members and front persons to invest his illicit fortune into ostensibly legitimate companies and real estate projects in the Mexican city of Guadalajara. OFAC designated 18 of these individuals, including six of Caro Quintero’s family members, and 15 entities on June 12, 2013.

Caro Quintero is wanted in the Central District of California on criminal charges related to the kidnapping and murder of SA Camarena as well as drug trafficking. The U.S. government is seeking Caro Quintero’s arrest to face these charges.

Today’s action, which designated 20 entities and one individual linked to Rafael Caro Quintero pursuant to the Kingpin Act, generally prohibits U.S. persons from conducting financial or commercial transactions with these designees, and also freezes any assets they may have under U.S. jurisdiction.

This action targeted 20 companies primarily located in or near Guadalajara. Several of these companies are engaged in real estate activities, including Arrendadora Turin, Barsat, and Villas del Colli. Others are gasoline retailers or engaged in agricultural activities, including Petro London, Servicio y Operadora Santa Ana, and Minerales Nueva Era, which produces and sells an organic fertilizer known as Diatomag as well as an organic pesticide known as Diatomkill.

Also designated today is Juan Carlos Soto Ruiz, a Guadalajaran native who plays a key management role in six of the companies designated today, including Arrendadora Turin and Servicio y Operadora Santa Ana, as well as three of the companies designated on June 12, 2013, including Pronto Shoes (a.k.a. CX-Shoes).

Since June 2000, the President has identified 103 drug kingpins, and OFAC has designated more than 1,300 businesses and individuals, pursuant to the Kingpin Act. Penalties for violations of the Kingpin Act range from civil penalties of up to $1.075 million per violation, to more severe criminal penalties. Criminal penalties for corporate officers may include up to 30 years in prison and fines up to $5 million. Criminal fines for corporations may reach $10 million. Other individuals could face up to 10 years in prison and fines pursuant to Title 18 of the United States Code for criminal violations of the Kingpin Act.

Key Points

Unlike victims of Bernie Madoff, who have gotten back large chunks of their principal, 18,000 customers of fraudster R. Allen Stanford have recovered practically nothing.
The Securities and Exchange Commission shut down Stanford's operations 10 years ago this week. As with Madoff, the SEC missed warning signs of the fraud for years.
The Stanford scam, second only to Madoff's in size, involved billions in fraudulent certificates of deposit.

Ten years after the second biggest investor fraud in U.S. history, victims of the $8 billion Ponzi scheme run by disgraced financier R. Allen Stanford have recovered practically nothing, court records show.

That's in stark contrast to the substantial recoveries on behalf of victims of the Bernard Madoff scam, which became public two months earlier.

The difference has enraged Stanford's victims — many of whom were retirees who had been sold ""safe"" investments — and has some lawmakers still calling for reforms.

""The only true justice Stanford's victims could ever see is in getting their savings back,"" said Angela Shaw, whose family lost millions in the collapse. ""Sadly, all they have seen and can expect to see is a few pennies on the dollar.""

A group of U.S. House members is preparing to ask the Securities and Exchange Commission to step up its efforts to aid the victims, according to a draft letter obtained by CNBC.

In February 2009, the SEC was already under scrutiny for its mishandling of the Madoff case, which broke two months earlier. With the financial crisis in full swing, speculation was swirling around Stanford, a Texas billionaire who had built a sprawling financial empire on his offshore bank in Antigua. Stanford, who referred to himself as ""Sir"" Allen Stanford after receiving a knighthood from the tiny Caribbean nation, styled himself as an international man of mystery who promoted the game of cricket and just might be a CIA operative (he was not).

'Massive' fraud

On Feb. 17, 2009, the SEC and FBI agents raided Stanford's Houston headquarters, shutting down the Stanford Financial Group's worldwide operations. In a civil complaint, the SEC accused Stanford and his associates of running a ""massive, ongoing fraud"" based on certificates of deposit issued by Stanford International Bank in Antigua and sold to investors by Stanford's U.S.-based brokerage arm. While Stanford claimed the CDs were backed by solid assets and posted returns that consistently beat the market, the SEC alleged the entire operation was a fraud that financed Stanford's lavish lifestyle.

A subsequent report by the SEC inspector general found that, as in the Madoff case, the agency had missed warning signs of the scandal for years. In the case of Stanford, according to the report, the missteps went back more than a decade to 1997. And the report found the agency's investigations were hampered by a regional enforcement official who would go on to do legal work for the firm.

Stanford, a former health club operator and insurance salesman from rural Texas who once falsely claimed to be related to the founder of Stanford University, insisted his businesses were legitimate. He alleged the SEC was scapegoating him following its mishandling of the Madoff investigation.

""Madoff comes along, well, they need somebody to make an example out of,"" he told CNBC in 2009.

But a federal jury in Houston disagreed, convicting Stanford in 2012 on 13 felony counts. Now 68, he is serving a 110-year sentence at a high security prison in Florida. But none of that — or the fact that Stanford was ordered to forfeit some $5.9 billion in cash that has long since been spent — is any solace to Stanford's 18,000 investors.

According to the most recent figures from Ralph Janvey, the court-appointed receiver rounding up funds for the victims, about $500 million of the roughly $5 billion in investor losses had been recovered as of Oct. 31, 2018. Of that, a court has approved about $224 million in fees and expenses for Janvey and his team. That leaves about $275 million — or about 5 cents on the dollar — for the victims.

An attorney for Janvey, Kevin Sadler, said the receivership has recovered about $200 million more since that report, including about $63 million in a settlement with Stanford's former law firm. And Janvey is still trying to recover hundreds of millions more in lawsuits against those who allegedly received fraudulent transfers from Stanford, including members of Stanford's sales force.

Other funds are in limbo, including some $160 million in Stanford's Swiss bank of choice, Societe Generale. That money was to be returned to investors under a settlement between U.S. and Antiguan regulators, but the bank has blocked its release.

Contrast to Madoff

Even if all of Janvey's efforts are successful, Stanford's investors are likely to receive only pennies on the dollar, while Madoff investors have recovered about 75 cents on the dollar in principal — and counting. Sadler said the difference is the result of different treatment of the two frauds by the agencies that normally look out for investors.

""Sadly, unlike in the Madoff case, Stanford investors were not eligible for SIPC coverage for their losses,"" Sadler told CNBC in an email. He was referring to the Securities Investor Protection Corporation, which compensates investors for securities and cash that are lost when a brokerage firm fails.

In the case of Madoff, SIPC oversaw the liquidation of the firm, made payments to thousands of investors, and covered the fees of court-appointed trustee Irving Picard. But in the case of Stanford, whose U.S. brokerage arm was a SIPC member, the agency argued that the securities in question — bogus CDs issued by a foreign bank — were not covered under the law. Thus, neither were the victims.

Sadler also noted that the Justice Department has recovered some $8 billion for Madoff victims through criminal prosecutions, including a $2 billion settlement with Madoff's primary bank, JPMorgan Chase. But in the Stanford case, prosecutors only targeted individuals.

Stanford and two of his of his top lieutenants — Mark Kuhrt and Gilberto Lopez — were convicted at trial. Two others, Chief Financial Officer James Davis and Chief Investment Officer Laura Pendergest-Holt, pleaded guilty. A sixth individual, Antiguan banking regulator Leroy King, has thus far successfully fought extradition.

""The cleanup efforts for the Stanford and Madoff frauds are routinely compared, but there is no question that the absence of both SIPC coverage and any multibillion-dollar U.S. DOJ recoveries for Stanford victims accounts for the substantial difference between distributions to the Madoff and Stanford victims,"" Sadler said.

But Shaw also blames Janvey, and the professionals he hired, for ""spending 50 cents for every dollar they've recovered."" And she says the SEC ""botched"" a lawsuit aimed at forcing SIPC to compensate the victims.

""The list is shockingly exhaustive with failure at every turn,"" she said.

Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., introduced legislation last year that would have allowed the SEC to take over the Stanford receivership and distribute funds to investors, but the proposal went nowhere.

For his part, Stanford has not given up trying to clear his name. Acting as his own attorney, he has cranked out a steady stream of court filings from prison, none with any success. In the most recent petition, filed in December, Stanford demands to be allowed to question Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who was FBI director during Stanford's prosecution, over alleged mishandling of evidence.

As Commerce Secretary, Wilbur Ross may have a lower profile than some of Donald Trump’s other cabinet secretaries, but he is no less corrupt and unqualified for his position.

Ross has invested heavily in and even served as Vice Chair of Bank of Cyprus, known for its connections to Russian money laundering and oligarchs.

He has business ties to Vladimir Putin’s inner circle; Ross’ investment firm has a 31.5% stake in a British ship-charter company, whose client is a Russian energy giant owned by Putin’s son-in-law and friend. Ross’ investment firm raised $500 million from the Chinese government.

Ross, who made much of his $700 million net worth from selling U.S. steel companies to foreign firms, did not pay for his steel workers’ pensions or retirees’ health care costs. He also left $2 billion in assets off of his financial disclosure form.",corruption

Two former prime ministers in Algeria have gone on trial on corruption charges, in the most high-profile act of transparency and accountability since a pro-democracy movement pushed out the long-serving president.

The exceptional trial, which is being televised and also involves several other former Algerian power players, comes at a time of renewed political tensions in the oil and gas-rich country, a week in advance of a controversial election to replace President Abdelaziz Bouteflika.

Ahmed Ouyahia, who was forced out as prime minister in March as protests against Bouteflika escalated, and his predecessor Abdelmalek Sellal, testified Wednesday at the Sidi M’Hamed court in Algiers.

The accused face charges ranging from money laundering to abuse of office and granting undue privileges in the vehicle assembly industry.

Lawyer Mohamed Madjdoub, speaking on behalf of the defence, told the judge that “conditions … do not allow for lawyers to accomplish their mission and therefore, I inform you that the defence has decided to boycott the trial”.

The judge asked the lawyers to leave the small, crowded courtroom and said the proceedings would continue.

The nascent Algerian automotive sector got its start in 2014, via partnerships between foreign groups and large Algerian corporations, often owned by businessmen linked to Bouteflika’s entourage.

Setting a precedent

It is the first time since Algeria’s independence from France in 1962 that former prime ministers have been put on trial.

The two men argued that the court was not competent to try them, the constitution stipulating that crimes and infractions committed by prime ministers while in office fell under a “High Court of State”.

But the organic law to establish this court was not passed and the prosecutor responded that they had to answer for their actions before the ordinary court.

Called first to the stand, Ouyahia was accused of “misappropriation of public funds, abuse of office, granting undue privileges, conflict of interest, corruption, money laundering and false statements”.

He was charged with favouring certain manufacturers in the automotive sector – even if they did not fulfil brief specifications – to the detriment of competitors.

“There is no misappropriation (of public funds) and the choice … was based on the market. These manufacturers were already present and we wanted to keep them,” the former prime minister said in his defence.

Former ministers Bedda Mahdjoub (industry and mines), Youcef Yousfi, who succeeded him in the post, and Abdelghani Zaalane (public works and transport) are other defendants in the case.

Also standing trial was Ali Haddad, former head of the main Algerian employer organisation, the Forum of Business Leaders (FCE).

The 54-year-old businessman is also the founder and CEO of private construction firm ETRHB.

Among the other businessmen being tried is former FCE vice president Mohamed Bairi, CEO of the Ival group, which owns industrial vehicle plant Iveco.

Ahmed Mazouz, president of the eponymous group that assembles and distributes Chinese-brand vehicles in Algeria, and Hassane Arbaoui, head of Global Group which runs an Algerian factory for South Korean company Kia, are also defendants.

Key issue

Algerian authorities are hoping the trial helps convince the public that they are serious about fighting corruption and reforming themselves – and persuade them to go out and vote next week.

Corruption is a key issue for Algeria’s peaceful, 9-month-old protest movement, which considers the election a sham because it’s organised by the existing power structure. Protesters want a whole new political system instead.

“Only the people can judge whether we have the will to combat corruption,” Justice Minister Belkacem Zeghmati told legislator before the trial, describing the alleged corruption as “going beyond all comprehension.”

Bouteflika, whose health condition has remained a mystery since a 2013 stroke, has not been seen in public since he left power. Jeune Afrique magazine reported that he is staying in his home in Zeralda under full-time medical care.",on trial
TMML202403304741,Thomas Barrack,"Alert ID: TMML202403304741
Tom Barrack and Donald Trump have been friends and confidants for more than three decades — the two men are so close, for instance, that Barrack comforted Trump during the funeral of his father, Fred.

But the intimate relationship between the wealthy California investor and the president has fractured so badly that the two no longer speak, current and former White House officials say.

The key issue driving the two men apart: Barrack’s role as chairman of the president’s 2017 inauguration fund, which is under investigation by prosecutors.

Trump was “really upset” to read reports about Barrack’s role in allegedly making it easy for some foreigners and others to try to spend money to get access to Trump and his inner circle and whether some of the inauguration money was misspent, according to a senior administration official.

“The president was really surprised to read all about the inauguration and who was trying to buy access and how, because the president doesn’t get any of that money,” said the official.

(The inaugural committee spent more than $1.5 million at Trump’s hotel in Washington.)

Barrack and Trump have known each other since the late 1980s, when Barrack, now CEO and executive chairman of the real estate and private equity firm Colony Capital, helped sell him the Plaza Hotel in New York for almost $410 million, a property that creditors later seized after Trump couldn’t make the full debt payments. (Trump took out a full-page ad in New York Magazine in 1988 saying the deal was “not economic” and that “I can never justify the price I paid.”)

Barrack, 72, has said in interviews that he grew close to Trump, 73, during “soft moments” such as their divorces and the birth of children. A major fundraiser for the 2016 campaign, he spoke warmly of his friend at the convention in Cleveland — flattering him by saying, among other things, that the New York real estate mogul had played him “like a Steinway piano” in business dealings.

In the early days of the administration, the newly minted president leaned often on his longtime friend for counsel and sympathy. Trump and Barrack sometimes would speak multiple times a day, according to the senior administration official, often calling Barrack late at night to seek advice and catch up. Trump has spoken glowingly of Barrack’s business acumen over the years; he told Fortune for a 2005 profile that “Tom has an amazing vision of the future, an ability to see what’s going to happen that no one else can match.”

But that advice has not always been stellar. According to the Mueller report, Barrack recommended that Trump hire his old friend Paul Manafort, who was initially brought onto the campaign to smooth Trump’s path at the Republican convention. Manafort went on to assume a larger role in the campaign after the firing of Corey Lewandowski, only to be ousted himself amid media scrutiny of his business dealings in Ukraine -- and later to be indicted for those activities.

And as other prosecutors have dug into Barrack’s handling of the inauguration fund, Trump has privately soured on his mentor.

In July, the New York Times reported that the public integrity unit of the U.S. Attorney’s office in Brooklyn was investigating whether Barrack violated laws requiring lobbyists to register when they work for foreign interests, though he has not been accused of any wrongdoing. In particular, the Times reported, prosecutors were probing whether the inauguration let foreigners from the Middle East use straw donors to donate to the inauguration.

Trump was surprised to learn elsewhere, according to a senior administration official, that the inaugural committee paid $26 million to the firm of Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, a New York social planner who was previously close to First Lady Melania Trump and was a senior adviser to her in the White House until early last year. (Only $500,000 of that money went to Wolkoff herself, according to documents Vanity Fair reviewed earlier this year.)

All the money raised for the convention, a record $107 million, was for the specific purpose of covering inauguration costs, but it came from a number of people and companies Barrack couldn’t convince to give money to the campaign or to outside groups when he was raising money for Trump during the 2016 campaign, according to the senior administration official.

“Trump improbably wins and they’re like, ‘Holy crap, I better send a check.’ They send a check to the inauguration and are like, ‘Look at me, six- or seven-figure check, I’m involved, I support your presidency,’” this person said. “But you didn’t support his candidacy three days ago.”

Trump’s feud with Barrack may not be permanent; the president has been known to turn on allies and friends, only to bring them back into the fold months or years later. But for now, it’s clear the breach is serious and deep.

The White House declined to comment on the split. But a spokesman for Barrack, Owen Blicksilver, pushed back on the notion that the two are no longer friendly.

“The relationship between Mr. Barrack and the president remains unchanged,” he said in a statement. “They have been friends for 40 years and Tom has great respect for President Trump and the incredibly daunting task of executing the job of president of the United States. Just as the president has worked 24/7 to lead the strongest economy in the last 50 years, Mr. Barrack also has a 24/7 responsibility leading a business he created 26 years ago.”

Still, Barrack has cut back his presence in Washington in the last six months and “has not been around” D.C. much recently, according to someone who knows him, although he attended a dinner that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin recently hosted for Qatari Emir Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani. Barrack also used to regularly attend dinners or parties hosted by Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, but hasn’t been to one recently.

“The last thing Trump needs is to be closely associated with one more person facing scrutiny and potential ethical issues,” said the person who knows Barrack.

The harsh spotlight goes well beyond the inauguration as Barrack, a Lebanese-American who is friendly with several Middle East leaders, has been accused of promoting his own business interests in his dealings with the president.

A report recently released by Democrats on the House Oversight and Reform Committee showed that Barrack worked with well-connected UAE businessman Rashid Al-Malik to make suggestions for an energy speech Trump gave in 2016 to be more favorable toward the Middle East and urged Manafort to get Trump to mention Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed.

He also allegedly pushed the administration to give Saudi Arabia access to sensitive nuclear technology while at the same time trying to profit from a potential deal, according to the House committee. (Trump read with interest the Wall Street Journal article on the report, according to the senior administration official.) Nonproliferation experts have opposed such a deal because they worried that it would make it much easier for Saudi Arabia to get a nuclear bomb to compete with Iran.

In late June, when Barrack spoke at the Middle East peace conference in Bahrain organized by the president’s son in law and adviser, Jared Kushner, “eyebrows were definitely raised” inside Trump’s orbit because of his inclusion, the senior administration official said.

Federal prosecutors have probed whether Barrack or other people violated laws requiring public disclosure of efforts to influence national policy or public opinion on behalf of foreign governments or entities, strictures that Manafort, former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn and former deputy campaign manager Rick Gates have all said they violated. Public integrity prosecutors who work for the U.S. Attorney’s office in Brooklyn interviewed Barrack in June as part of the investigation, albeit at Barrack’s request, according to the Times.

Barrack’s spokesman said that Barrack has fully cooperated with the investigation and that his counsel reached out to the Justice Department, which the spokesman said had confirmed that it had no further questions for Barrack. A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney’s office declined to comment.

Barrack cooperated with requests from Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee for their investigation into Trump, with Barrack’s spokesman telling CNBC it was “important work.”

Former special counsel Robert Mueller’s team of investigators also questioned Barrack as part of his probe into Trump’s connections with Russia, which did not go unnoticed inside the White House.

Another point of friction in Trump’s relationship with Barrack is that he kept Gates, who pleaded guilty to two charges and became a star witness for Mueller, on his company Colony NorthStar’s payroll — at a rate of $20,000 per month, according to the Times — up until the moment when Gates was indicted for money laundering and violating foreign lobbying and tax laws.

Early in Trump’s presidency, Barrack brought Gates to the White House several times and also kept paying him even after Trump urged his friend to fire Gates because he was “bad luck” and “a bad penny” who wouldn’t go away, according to the senior administration official. Gates admitted during Manafort’s trial last summer that he might have stolen money from the inaugural committee, which he helped manage. Gates and his lawyer did not respond to requests for comment.

Several sources said Trump’s falling out with Barrack, who hasn’t yet donated to Trump’s re-election campaign, began even before the damaging reports about the inaugural committee.

“Barrack is the kind of guy who would tell him things he didn’t want to hear, so Trump stopped talking to him,” a former senior White House official said.

Barrack has also made some critical remarks about Trump’s performance in office and said in Trump’s first year that his friend was “better than this” (referring to Trump’s rhetoric toward Muslims and immigrants), and that he was “shocked” and “stunned” by some of the remarks.

At the start of Trump’s presidency, according to another person close to Trump, the president “got tired” of Barrack “because he felt that Tom was checking in all the time and he was a little perturbed by the fact that Tom wanted to be special envoy to the Middle East and then special envoy in South America and then he was going to be the ambassador to Argentina and then he didn’t want that and then he was going to be ambassador to Mexico.

“He was just kind of scattered all over,” the person added.",corruption
TMML202403583151,Mitzi Bickers,"Alert ID: TMML202403583151
ATLANTA - Mitzi Bickers has been arraigned on 11 federal charges including conspiring to commit bribery, wire fraud, money-laundering, federal obstruction and tax fraud. Bickers was indicted by a federal grand jury on March 27, 2018.

“City of Atlanta contracts always should go to the most qualified bidder through a contracting process that is fair and transparent,” said U.S. Attorney Byung J. “BJay” Pak. “Instead, Mitzi Bickers allegedly conspired to use her influence as a high-ranking City of Atlanta official and later as a connected political consultant to steer lucrative city contracts to Elvin R. Mitchell, Jr., Charles P. Richards, Jr., and their companies through bribery. The illicit arrangement netted over $2 million in bribes for Bickers and almost $17 million in city contracts for Mitchell and Richards, and has shaken the public’s trust in the city’s contracting process.”

“The actions of Bickers, alleged in this indictment, traded the public’s trust in a fair bidding process for personal gain,” said David J. LeValley, Special Agent in Charge of FBI Atlanta. “The FBI and its partners in law enforcement will not tolerate those who choose to try to influence established and proper government procedures.”

“Public officials need to be reminded of the trust and duty bestowed upon them by the taxpayers to serve the public’s interest not their own,” said Thomas J. Holloman, Special Agent in Charge, IRS-Criminal Investigation. “When public officials and those seeking to do business with them break this trust by committing fraud, they will be charged to the fullest extent of the law.”

According to U.S. Attorney Pak, the charges, and other information presented in court: As the City of Atlanta’s Director of Human Services and after leaving employment with the city, Bickers allegedly conspired with contractors Elvin R. Mitchell, Jr. and Charles P. Richards, Jr. to accept bribe payments for herself and other public officials in exchange for the her agreement to obtain city contracts for Mitchell’s and Richards’ companies. Both Mitchell and Richards have pleaded guilty to paying bribes to Bickers and are currently serving federal prison sentences for their crimes.

In 2009, Bickers worked on the mayoral campaign and began working for the City of Atlanta after the election. From February 2010 to May 22, 2013, Bickers served as the City of Atlanta’s Director of Human Services. Beginning in 2010, Mitchell and Richards agreed to pay bribes to Bickers to secure profitable City of Atlanta contracts for their businesses. At times, the bribe payments allegedly were referred to as “up-front money.” In reality, Mitchell and Richards often paid Bickers when their companies actually received City of Atlanta contract work.

In exchange for the bribe payments, Bickers promised to represent Mitchell, Richards and their companies on matters relating to City of Atlanta contracting, even though she was a high-level city employee at the time. Bickers also allegedly provided Mitchell and Richards with sensitive contracting information during the critical time when they were bidding on city contracts. Between 2010 and 2013, Mitchell’s and Richard’s companies received multi-million dollar contracts with the city for snow removal, sidewalk repair and maintenance, and bridge reconstruction.

In effort to conceal her relationship with Mitchell and Richards, Bickers allegedly filed numerous false City of Atlanta Financial Disclosure Forms. For example, in 2011, Bickers swore under penalty of perjury that she had no financial relationships with any outside businesses, even though Mitchell’s and Richards’ companies paid her over $650,000 in that year. She used much of this money to purchase a $775,000 lakefront home in Jonesboro, Georgia, making a down payment of over a half million dollars. In that same year, Bickers also allegedly claimed on her taxes that she made only $57,896 as a city employee, resulting in a $3,924 tax refund from the IRS.

In 2013, Bickers’ financial ties to the Pirouette Companies came to light and Bickers resigned her position with the City of Atlanta. After her resignation, Bickers, Mitchell, and Richards allegedly continued the bribery scheme. For example, Bickers helped Mitchell secure a multi-million dollar contract for snow and debris removal work after a snowstorm locked down Atlanta in 2014. In turn, Mitchell paid Bickers and companies associated with her hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes. Bickers spent the proceeds of the bribery at stores like Gucci and on expensive vacations, home renovations, four Yamaha WaveRunners, a sports utility vehicle and an ATV. Bickers is also charged with money laundering for purchasing an SUV and four WaveRunners with bribery proceeds from an account held by the Bickers Group, which was her political consulting company.

Ultimately, between 2010 and 2015, Mitchell and Richards allegedly paid Bickers and companies associated with her over $2 million in an attempt get City of Atlanta contracts through bribery. In this same period, the City of Atlanta paid Mitchell’s and Richards’ businesses approximately $17 million for the government contracts they secured.

In September 2015, Mitchell began cooperating with FBI’s investigation into corruption at City Hall. On September 11, 2015 at approximately 5:30 a.m., Shandarrick Barnes threw a concrete block reading “ER, keep your mouth shut!” through a plate glass window in Mitchell’s home. Bickers is alleged to have played a role in this attempt to obstruct the federal investigation. Barnes will be sentenced by District Court Judge Steven C. Jones on April 9, 2018.

Mitzi Bickers, 51, of Atlanta, Georgia, was arraigned today before U.S. Magistrate Judge Russell G. Vineyard. Members of the public are reminded that the indictment only contains charges. The defendant is presumed innocent of the charges and it will be the government’s burden to prove the defendant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt at trial.

This case is being investigated by the FBI and Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation.

First Assistant U.S. Attorney Kurt R. Erskine and Assistant U.S. Attorney Jeffrey W. Davis are prosecuting the case.

President Obama is nominating his top fund raiser, Penny Pritzker, to be Secretary of Commerce. Incredibly - perhaps I should write, sadly - the announcement is causing hardly a stir among the liberal and progressive blogosphere. At the very least, Greg Palast's May 4, 2013 post at Smirking Chimp, Billionaire Bankster Breaks into Obama’s Cabinet, should be going viral. Palast wrote:

Pritzker’s net worth is listed in Forbes as $1.8 billion, which is one hell of a heavy magic wand in the world of politics. Her wand would have been heavier, and her net worth higher, except that in 2001, the federal government fined her and her family $460 million for the predatory, deceitful, racist tactics and practices of Superior, the bank-and-loan-shark operation she ran on the South Side of Chicago.

Superior was the first of the deregulated go-go banks to go bust – at the time, the costliest failure ever. US taxpayers lost nearly half a billion dollars. Superior’s depositors lost millions and poor folk in Sen. Obama’s South Side district lost their homes.

There were also a couple diaries on DailyKos, including by front pager Laura Clawson, who called attention to Pritzker's and her family's role in Hyatt Hotels, which has compiled what may be the worst records of labor abuses in the hotel industry. Incredibly, just to prove, I suppose, how hopelessly uninformed, ignorant, and unaware liberals and progressives can be, someone posted in one of the first comments, ""She's not the monster you think she is.""

Even President Obama rushed to show that he was likewise uninformed, ignorant, and unaware, though at this point I'm not about to attach the labels ""liberal"" or ""progressive"" to him. ""She's built companies from the ground up,"" Obama said. ""She knows from experience that no government program alone can take the place of a great entrepreneur.""

There once were, in most every city, old labor and socialist organizers, veterans of the labor strife of the 1920s and 1930s, you could sit down with in a neighborhood tavern, and during the course of an evening, well lubricated by a few pitchers of beer, tell you more than you really wanted to know about who was actually running your town. How the police chief's kids got really good paying jobs because the chief would not make too many inquiries about (in other words, would remain deliberately uninformed, ignorant, and unaware) the prostitution on the West Side; or the numbers racket along the riverfront; or the freight pilferage at the airport. How the mayor's wife was able to drive around in a brand new Cadillac because a certain tract of land had been quietly rezoned, to the advantage a mayoral crony. Such petty corruption used to be the stock in trade of good local investigative reporters at big metropolitan newspapers, back in a nearly forgotten era when FCC rules made it nearly impossible for one or two corporate behemoths to own every major newspaper, radio station, and television station in one city.

Many of you already know that I used to be an economics correspondent, and that I burned out and became depressed watching Wall Street have its way in the early 1990s in what was called, back then, ""off balance sheet liabilities"" (what we today call ""financial derivatives"" - the stuff, like credit default swaps, that blew up in 2007 through 2008, and left a dismaying amount of the world's economy in ashes). Well, that's not really the whole truth. About what got me depressed, that is. So, tonight, you're going to learn a bit more of the truth. You're going to learn some of the dark, frightful secrets hidden away in my memory; stuff I usually don't mention, because it makes a lot of people very uncomfortable.

In a word, the mob. Organized crime. The syndicate. In Chicago, it was called the Outfit. But every major city had its own crime family, or branch thereof. You see, part of what I researched and wrote about in that depressing period of nearly a quarter century ago was how the billions of dollars, nay, hundreds of billions of dollars that were fueling what was politely called mergers and acquisitions, most especially including leveraged buy outs, came from, not entirely, but in large part, organized crime. That included hundreds of billions of dollars that the Wall Street banks laundered from illegal narcotics trafficking, including heroin and cocaine. The beginnings of financial derivatives were closely tied to the mob going legit.

So, the Reagan regime of deregulation was really a double whammy. It basically decriminalized the worst behavior of banks and corporations, at the very time that some of the most immoral, ruthless, indeed murderous, people in America were buying legitimacy for themselves and their heirs by seizing control, through brazen manipulation of debt and stock markets, of America's industrial companies.

The story of the hour is Penny Pritzker becoming Secretary of Commerce. So, tonight, you're going to learn about the Pritizker family and its fortune. I suspect that it's probably more than you want to know.

The origins of the Pritzker family fortune was her grandfather's mob connections when he was a tax attorney for a lot of people in ""The Outfit,"" the Chicago mob, beginning under Al Capone, and continuing through the 1980s. This connection to organized crime was reportedly what financed the creation of Hyatt Hotels by Penny's father. There was no crime involved, but the financial backing came from organized crime, plain and simple. The details are in Gus Russo's 2006 tome Supermob: How Sidney Korshak and His Criminal Associates Became America's Hidden Power Brokers. Russo's book is crucial reading for anyone trying to understand why America's ruling elites are, well, so bad.

It's not really a matter of incompetence or ineptitude. Rather, it is a case study in how the republican (small ""r"", not capital ""R"" as in the Republican Party, or GOP - greedy old pricks) ideals of public virtue, the general welfare, and economic and political equality, are forgotten and eventually undermined by allowing a criminal class to become legitimate and amass political and economic influence. The story of the Pritzker family is an all-American story, of how a family with ties to organized crime amasses a great fortune while striving relentlessly for legitimacy, and arrives at the pinnacle of economic and political power in America. Chris Hedges is not exaggerating when he states that""the criminal class in this country has seized power.""

This ascent to America's summits is an oft-trod trek, pioneered by Boston and Newport maritime merchants who parlayed opium and millions of ruined lives in China into wealth, respectability, and power in the 1800s. Many of the mercantile banks established along the way are still with us, brightened and prettified by numerous changes in corporate branding. The one constant is the ruthless concentration on private gain. The extent to which that concentration on private gain is tempered and ameliorated by fleeting notions of public service provides the cracks and crevices in which the ebb and flow of history eddy and swirl.

Now, you can point to the Kennedy family as an example of ill-begotten gains leading to some very good minded public service. But Penny Pritzker's roles at Hyatt and Superior Bank are, to say the least, highly troubling, and cast doubt on the idea that she may be anywhere near as mindful of the general welfare as John, Bobby, and Edward Kennedy were. Instead of public service, the tradition in the Pritzker family seems focused on economic exploitation of others, skirting the law as much as possible, and shady dealings. There is a strong tradition in the Pritzker family of outright money laundering and offshore tax evasion.

Before Superior Bank, the Pritzkers controlled Frontier Finance, a loan company in Chicago that one source told Russo ""is believed to be the secret to the origins of the family's involvement with criminals."" The president of Frontier Finance was Frank Buccieri. And Buccieri's brother was the greatly feared ""collector"" for the Outfit, Fiore ""Fifi"" Buccieri, who Life magazine in May 1969 termed ""leader of [Sam] Giancana's assassination squads."" The Wikipedia entry on Fiori Buccieri is chilling:

During the bootleg wars of Prohibition, Buccieri was reportedly involved in at least 10 gangland slayings. In the 1960s, following Giancana's rise to the day-to-day ""boss"" position in the Outfit, Buccieri served as a top enforcer and personal hitman. He was also involved in labor racketeering bombing, arson and loan sharking.

As a loan shark, Buccieri would send his men to stake out employment offices. These thugs would pass out business cards to the unemployed that listed Buccieri as a, ""loan officer."" The mob generally viewed unemployed workers as poor loan prospects; however, Buccieri was so effective at intimidating his ""juice,"" or ""loan interest,"" victims that they would steal or rob to pay him off. Buccieri would often warn friends of a ""juice"" victim not to ride around with him, ""because he is going to get hit."" When the victim heard this warning, he would quickly pay up.

It is not clear whether Fiore Buccieri's ""sales pitches"" at employment offices fed ""clients"" to his brother's (and Pritzker's) Frontier Finance, but that is a reasonable assumption. Buccieri used a warehouse where he would hang his victims on a meathook (maybe Hollywood got this gruseome idea from its mob connections?), the most infamous such murder was that of loanshark William ""Action"" Jackson, in 1961. After being arrested while unloading a truck of stolen radios then released, rumor spread within the Outfit that Jackson had become an FBI informant. Buccieri and two others hung the 300-pound Jackson on a meat hook and tortured him with ice picks, baseball bats, a blow torch and an electric cattle prod for nearly three days, until Jackson finally died. Federal authorities later obtained details of Jackson's murder from conversations overheard between Buccieri and one of the other murderers.

But, you object, so far all we have is guilt by association. Uh, yeah. Get over it. In fact, learn to use it. You want a criminal indictment or conviction? Ain't going to happen. Not for the most successful criminals. As Russo quotes John P. Barnes, Judge of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois from the 1930s top 1950s: “The Syndicate could not operate without the approval of the [State's Attorney's] office.... The relationship between the State's Attorney's office, and Capone's Syndicate, under [Tom] Courtney and [Dan] Gilbert, was such that during the entire period that Courtney was in office [1932-44], no Syndicate man was ever convicted of a major crime in Cook County.""

A specialty developed and refined by the Chicago Outfit was labor racketeering. Al Capone's very own lawyer, Abe Teitelbaum got the bar rolling when he was ""hired' as the attorney for the Chicago Bar and Restaurant Association in 1932. As the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Improper Activities in Labor and Management (also known as the McClellan Committee) stated in its final report in 1950, the Association, under the counsel of Teitelbaum, functioned ""principally to to defeat and destroy legitimate unionization and has callously and calculatedly used men with underworld connections to make collusive arrangements with dishonest union officials.""

Teitelbaum's labor racketeering became of forte of Sidney Korshak, who would become a key Pritzker associate. Russo writes that

In the case of unions not directly under the mob's control, it was often just a simple matter of paying off the union bosses to persuade them to accept a substandard deal, a modus operandi adopted by Sid Korshak. ""He made cash payoffs to business agents - five thousand dollars here, three thousand dollars there,"" said Leo Geffner, a Los Angeles attorney who negotiated with Korshak years later. ""I know that. That's the way it was--to keep labor peace, you'd find a corrupt business agent and pay him off."" Of course, in doing so, the racketeer stabbed both the workers and their employers in the back. Ironically, this was the very abuse suffered by Korshak's grandparents in Kiev. The ever-vigiulent Korshak gadfly, Lester Velie, succinctly described [in Readers Digest in 1957] how the treachery worked: ""The deal may be to bring a ""friendly"" union in, or to keep a union out, or to accept substandard wages.... In the deals that the go-between arranges, the union's function is perverted. Instead of serving as an instrument to win better wages and working conditions, it becomes a tool for keeping the worker in line. Thus it performs the same function as the unions do in Communist Russia.""

What do you think? Would it be impolite to ask Penny Pritizker, in her confirmation hearings, about her grandfather's relations to organized crime? Is it impolite to ask her if her ideas about suppressing workers wages are in any way informed or influenced by the role of her grandfather's associates in smashing and corrupting unions? It does seem to be a tradition in her family.

Is it impolite to ask about the similarities in the business models of Frontier Finance in the 1950s and Superior Bank in the 1990s? And is Penny Pritzker now willing, without hesitation, to condemn the type of banking practices that seem to be another family tradition among the Pritzkers? Back in February 2008, Dennis Bernstein reported, in Obama's Sub-Prime Conflict,

Though Superior Bank collapsed years before the current sub-prime turmoil that is rocking the world’s financial markets – and pushing those millions of homeowners toward foreclosure – some banking experts say the Pritzkers and Superior hold a special place in the history of the sub-prime fiasco.

“The [sub-prime] financial engineering that created the Wall Street meltdown was developed by the Pritzkers and Ernst and Young, working with Merrill Lynch to sell bonds securitized by sub-prime mortgages,” Timothy J. Anderson, a whistleblower on financial and bank fraud, told me in an interview.

“The sub-prime mortgages,” Anderson said, “were provided to Merrill Lynch, by a nation-wide Pritzker origination system, using Superior as the cash cow, with many millions in FDIC insured deposits. Superior’s owners were to sub-prime lending, what Michael Milken was to junk bonds”

In other words, if you traced today’s sub-prime crisis back to its origins, you would come upon the
role of the Pritzkers and Superior Bank of Chicago.... When it collapsed in 2001, Superior Bank represented the largest failure of a U.S.-insured depository institution for a decade.

“The failure of Superior Bank was directly attributable to the Bank’s Board of Directors and executives ignoring sound risk management principles,” said FDIC Inspector General Gaston Gianni Jr. in a Feb. 7, 2002, report.

Banking whistleblower Anderson noted that “Superior failed at a time of historically low interest rates, high employment, a strong economy, and a growing housing market.… There was no reason for it to fail unless you consider gross negligence, a flawed business plan, and a conspiracy to deceive the regulators who were clearly asleep and were negligent themselves in their duties of protecting the class of underinsured depositors.”

A few voices the past few weeks have raised the issue of Hyatt Hotels and Superior Bank, but this past week, Rick Perlstein's two-part article in The Nation, raised an even more troubling chapter of Pritzker history: the family's connection to Castle Bank of the Bahamas. According to Russo (pages 439 ff.) Castle Bank was the granddaddy of offshore money laundering and tax evasion. Castle Bank was set up in 1964 by former senior Office of Strategic Services officer Paul Helliwell, who had become an important cutout for hiding CIA funds; Morris Kleinman of the Cleveland organized crime family headed by Moe Dalitz; Burton Kanter, a tax attorney for the Pritzkers, and a board member of Hyatt; and Stanford Clinton, a partner in grandpa Pritzker's law firm, and a trustee of the Teamsters Pension Fund, which was an important center of mob finances in the 1950s through 1960s. (Much of the financing for organized crime's invasion of Las Vegas came from the Teamsters Pension Fund, usually at absurdly low interest rates. Russo, p. 438, notes that Hyatt's 1972 acquisition of the Four Queens casino was financed by a loan from the Teamsters Pension Fund loan at just four percent, saving Hyatt $8 million.)

Essentially, Castle Bank pioneered the development of offshore money laundering and hiding, and served not only to launder illegally obtained money for US organized crime families, but to launder money for the CIA to fund various covert operations around the world, particularly in South America. According to Russo,

....it turned out that the Pritzkers were the largest depositors in one of the most notorious offshore tax havens ever devised, The Castle Bank of the Bahamas, which was nothing less than an intersection of the Supermob, known gangsters, pop stars, a U.S. president, and the covert branch of the CIA--all of whom had good reason to hide their money from Uncle Sam. Bahamian and Cayman Islands banks have long been valued by those wishing to hide their money because those nations absolutely refuse to cooperate with U.S. law enforcement. Bank expert and author Penny Lernoux wrote of the main advantage of the Caribbean banks: ""Relying on a strict code of banking secrecy that makes Swiss banks look like blabbermouths, hundreds of banks have set up operations in the Caribbean."" To further guarantee its clients’ anonymity, Castle had arranged for Miami National Bank, which was controlled by Lansky associates, to accept the deposits, then transfer the deposit list to Castle with no names attached--only code numbers.

Agent Furfaro was among those frustrated by the government's inability to follow the money trail. ""The money was getting out of the country through Western Union,"" Furfaro recently said. ""But we weren't allowed to follow it. And the foreign banks wouldn't let us in. We had reports that money was also being shipped in railroad cars and containers placed on ships. There was so much money that they would just weigh it instead of count it....

...Given all the Pritzker associates involved in the management of Castle, it came as no surprise when Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Knut Royce determined in 1982 that the Pritzkers were in fact the bank's largest depositors. A September 1972 IRS statement noted, 'An informant [F. Eugene Poe, a former VP and director of Castle Bank] with access to the records of Castle Trust has stated that the Pritzker family of Chicago, through their Hyatt Corporation, received their initial backing from organized crime.

By 1977, IRS investigators had made things so hot for Castle Bank that it lost its banking license in the Bahamas, and moved to Panama. In April 1980, the Washington Post reported that not much more came of the IRS investigations because the CIA's Office of General Counsel warned that further pursuit of Castle ""would harm the national security."" (A scan of the Post article was online here at the time of this writing.) Russo notes that at the time the IRS investigation was terminated, the IRS Commissioner was Nixon appointee Donald Alexander, who was a senior partner in the Cincinnati law firm of Dinsmore, Shohl, Coates and Deupree - which law firm also had accounts with Castle Bank. Alexander either ordered or accepted the termination of the investigation into Castle Bank, despite it having already recovered $52.5 million in tax penalties.

Frontier Finance. Castle Bank. Superior Bank. If you don't see a pattern yet, Russo reports on page 521 that when the Pritzkers began to develop their Hyatt hotels in Saudi Arabia, they partnered with the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI), at one time the seventh largest private bank in the world. In July 1991, customs and bank regulators in seven countries raided and seized the branch offices of BCCI in their countries because BCCI was involved in massive money laundering and other financial crimes worldwide. In 1986, a US Customs undercover operation had infiltrated BCCI and found the bank actively solicited deposits from drug traffickers and money launderers, including the Medellin Cartel. Among BCCI's clients were Saddam Hussein, Manuel Noriega, Hussain Mohammad Ershad and Samuel Doe. USMC Colonel Oliver North used multiple accounts at BCCI to fund Reagan's Iran-Contra operations. And, true to the pattern, the CIA also used BCCI to finance and buy arms for the Afghan mujahideen fighting the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan.

Maybe not all rich people are bad. Maybe there are some that made lots of money actually doing something useful. I personally don't think so. I don’t believe there are that many rich people – and I mean people in the top one percent, people with a hundred million or more, and most especially I mean billionaires – who got rich honestly and without hurting a lot of people on their way to the top. When I review the history of the Pritzker family, and its rise to political power in the person of Penny Pritzker, I think it is just the most recent example of the process the Bible describes about how a nation comes to be ruled by mean-spirited and unjust people. Then I look at the destruction of America's working class since 1980, and I see the warnings of the Bible about the disasters that befall such a nation being fulfilled.

Penny Pritzker, I’m sure, is a perfectly charming and very nice lady. I have no doubt she throws nice parties, and donates to very worthwhile charities, and is a pillar of her local community. But honestly, screw Godwin’s law: the very same was said about a lot of Germans in the 1950s who were officers and guards at Nazi death camps just a few years before. Why is it so hard to comprehend that someone can be a sweet and wonderful parent and grandparent, a rock of their church, a pillar of their community, yet make a living being the most despicably ruthless corporate banditti. I mean, who are the people who work at the banks that foreclosed on the homes of actively deployed servicemen and women? Or the people that are now overseeing the robo-signing the latest wave of fraudulent bank actions, collection of credit card debt? Maybe we don’t like to think about this; maybe we’re much more comfortable reading about the latest corporate or bankster ripoff, or corruption of our political life, or oil spill, and not actually know the people who occupy those corporate offices and cubicles day in and day out, and whose job it is that results in those ripoffs, corruption, and oil spills. Maybe it’s easier for us if we refuse to see them for who they are, and instead maintain in our mind a cartoonish caricature of a villain, with the shifty eyes, and the evil sneer, and the menacing five o’clock shadow.

But, I ask you to take a breath and think of Penny Pritzker. She was the head of a hotel chain that committed serial violations of labor law, and repeatedly, over years, systematically cheated tens of thousands of employees out of wages and benefits. And before that she directed the affairs of a bank that was among the most blatant in committing financial fraud and abuse. Is Penny Pritzker a criminal? Probably not under today's laws in the USA. We have pretty well decriminalized criminal behavior committed under a corporate guise. And now we have a new doctrine, that if there is the possibility that your enterprise is so huge and so important that its failure just might endanger the ""stability"" or the ""integrity"" of the financial system, then you will simply not be held to account. But is this the type of person you really want as your Secretary of Commerce? Is this the type of person you really want as a top adviser to the President of the United States?

Perhaps it's a good thing to let criminal families become legitimate. They hopefully are no longer committing crimes. I can assure you, this is going to be an issue many of you are going to have tpo grapple with in your own community. Just who do you think has had the money to buy real estate in inner cities and even suburbs the past five years of ""green shoots"" ""recovery""? Why, it's been your friendly neighborhood drug dealers and money launderers! Does it make a difference who are the leaders in a community? Maybe you don't think so, but it sure makes for popular movies: Frank Capra's 1946 classic, It's a Wonderful Life, in which James Stewart as bank officer George Bailey is dissuaded from suicide by an angel who shows him how debauched and evil the town becomes without his influence. Or, Robert Zemeckis' 1989 Back to the Future Part II, in which Marty and the Professor have to go back in time to stop Biff from becoming rich and totally corrupting Hill Valley. Are these just modernized fairy tales we entertain ourselves with? Or are they reflections of deeper currents of political history and social consciousness we now ignore at our peril?

Should we not be concerned about the character of our leaders at the national level as well?

To the promotion of interested Pursuits, and the gratification of voluptuous wishes, a ready sacrifice is made of the general good at the shrine of power. Then slumbers that virtuous jealousy of public men and public measures, which was wont to scrutinize not only actions but motives; then nods that active zeal, which, with eagle eye watched, and with nervous arm defended the constitution. Every day new inroads are made upon public liberty, while encroachments, like temptations, grow more frequent and more dangerous in proportion as the power of resistance decreases. Thus, before a nation is completely deprived of freedom, she must be fitted for slavery by her vices.

-- Oration Delivered at Boston, March 5, 1779, by William Tudor, Esq., in On, Principles and Acts of the Revolution in America, by Hezekiah Niles, 1822.

While I am more than willing to criticize Obama about these atrocious choices for economic advisers and officials he continually makes, I would prefer people focus on the problem of the pecuniary culture of our country, rather than being distracted in a useless debate over whether or not Obama is a corporate shill or a Reaganite in disguise, or whatever. Look at it this way: what really are the political chances that someone like Bill Black or Michael Hudson will be nominated and approved for high level economic policy positions? Or, another way, why do the greediest and most selfish people, with no conception at all of the general welfare, so completely dominate economic policy making in the USA? Why, in a word, does the political culture spawned by the neo-liberal idea that market forces should dictate the destinies of nations rather than the people acting through the agency of their government, leave us with such horrible, pernicious elites? We may comfort ourselves by thinking our elites are merely incompetent, or even greedy and corrupt, but I have reached the conclusion that such analyses is dangerous as it does not strike at the criminal essence of our elites.

The older I get, the more bruises I suffer toiling to accumulate wisdom, the more I come to appreciate what an excellent book the Bible is. Penny Pritzker, oppressor of labor, smasher of unions, exploiter of the poor, consort of criminals. “By their fruits ye shall know them,” the Bible counsels. Tell me, please, exactly what policies do you expect a person like Penny Pritzker to champion? Will they be policies that help working men and women? Please, tell me.

No, wait, I don’t need to be told. Tell yourself.",

The jailed promoter of crisis-hit mortgage lender DHFL, Kapil Wadhawan, has offered his personal and family properties, which he claims are worth Rs 43,000 crore, for repayment of outstanding loans of lenders to the company.

Wadhawan wrote to RBI-appointed administrator R Subramaniakumar on October 17 saying his offer would ensure maximum value for the assets that have been put on the block to repay loans.

Currently under judicial custody, Wadhawan has proposed to the transfer of the right, title and interest in various projects which form part of the real estate portfolio of his family to enable proper and complete resolution of DHFL and to maximise the value of the properties.

The valuation of these projects including Juhu Galli project and Irla project are about Rs 43,879 crore that to at a 15 per cent lesser market value, the letter dated October 17 said.

Wadhawan has mentioned that after the IL&FS crisis in September 2018, not only DHFL but all the NBFCs face major financial crisis and the company took various steps and repaid Rs 44,000 crore of liabilities by monetising DHFL's assets such Aadhaar housing finance Ltd, Avanse Financial, DHFL Pramerica Asset Managers and DHFL Pramerica Trustee Ltd.

On June 7, 2019, RBI issued a circular on Prudential Framework for resolution of stressed assets and the process of restructuring DHFL's debt and resolution of its financial stress began.

An Inter Creditor Agreement (ICA) was executed on July 5, 2019 among the banks and some lenders. The exposure of the lenders who signed the ICA was Rs 39,000 crore.

Even today DHFL's collection has been between Rs 10,000-15,000 crore and are available to repay the lenders, Wadhawan said in the nine-page letter sent from Taloja jail on the outskirts of Mumbai, where he and brother Dheeraj are currently lodged.

Wadhawan, who is in judicial custody since April on various charges including violation of money laundering law, said, ""The erstwhile management of DHFL have made all the efforts to resolve the financial stress being faced by DHF. This letter is one more effort in continuation of our resolve.

Last week, Adani Group, Piramal Enterprises and two other entities placed bids for DHFL, the first financial services player undergoing insolvency process, according to sources.

The US-based Oaktree and Hong Kong-based SC Lowy submitted bids for DHFL on October 17, the last date to submit final bids, the sources said.

In November, the Reserve Bank referred DHFL, the third largest pure-play mortgage lender, to the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) for insolvency proceedings.

According to a filing last month, fraudulent transactions worth Rs 17,394 crore were reported at DHFL during 2006-07 to 2018-19, as per a report of transaction auditor Grant Thornton.

Fund diversion by the promoters of DHFL resulted in lenders classifying DHFL account as ""fraud"".

Another fraudulent transactions worth Rs 12,705.53 crore were reported by the forensic audit, followed by the third one earlier this month.

The third fraud worth Rs 2,150.84 crore, by way of undervaluing the company's insurance subsidiary, was detected by Grant Thornton.

CHICAGO (CBS) — Former Ald. Ed Vrdolyak asked to have his sentencing hearing postponed Thursday, after he fell and hurt himself and home.

Vrdolyak’s attorneys said he suffered a fall at his home on Monday and suffered head trauma that required hospital care. He was also set to go for an MRI on Wednesday, his attorneys said.

Vrdolyak is in a great deal of pain, and his primary care doctor is out of town until next week, his attorneys said. The doctor wants to see Vrdolyak and determine an appropriate treatment plan at that point, according to his attorneys.

Defense lawyers asked U.S. District Judge Robert Dow to have Vrdolyak’s sentencing hearing moved from Oct. 2 to a yet-to-be-scheduled date in December so Vrdolyak can obtain the necessary medical treatment and also obtain medical records that he can present to the court.

Vrdolyak, 81, pleaded guilty in March to a tax charge tied to a tobacco settlement scheme. An indictment accused him of tax evasion tied to money he allegedly collected from a tobacco lawsuit settlement he never actually worked on.

He allegedly worked out a deal to collect up to $65 million in legal fees from the tobacco case, although the charges do not specify how much money he actually was paid or how much income tax he failed to pay.

According to the U.S. Attorney of the Northern District Of Illinois, Vrdolyak conceded that he helped another lawyer, co-defendant Daniel P. Soso, in evading income taxes from 1993 through 2004 and then again from 2008 through 2013. The money came from attorney fees received connected to a $9.2 billion settlement between the state and several tobacco companies in the 1990s.

He paid Soso between 2000 and 2005 around two million dollars, representing Soso’s “agreed-upon share of the fees of the tobacco litigation.”

Vrdolyak pleaded not guilty in 2016 to an indictment accusing him of tax evasion charges. The federal charge alleged he obstructed an IRS investigation into the tobacco settlement by hiding payments with Soso’s assistance.

Vrdolyak previously served a 10-month prison sentence after pleading guilty to mail fraud in a $1.5 million kickback scheme in 2008. He admitted to scheming with businessman and convicted scam artist Stuart Levine to split a payoff to arrange the sale of a Gold Coast building belonging to Smithfield Properties, eliminating other bidders.

The building had belonged to the former Chicago Medical School.

In the 2008 case, Vrdolyak was initially sentenced to probation by U.S. District Judge Milton I. Shadur. But in 2009, Vrdolyak was resentenced to 10 months in prison by Judge Matthew Kennelly after prosecutors appealed the original sentence and an appeals panel agreed.

The former alderman of the Southeast Side’s 10th Ward earned the nickname “Fast Eddie” for his reputation for working backroom political deals while steering clear of criminal charges during his four terms as alderman from 1971 to 1986.

Vrdolyak also served the chairman of the Cook County Democratic Party, and he led the bloc of 29 aldermen who battled the late Mayor Harold Washington during the “Council Wars” era, from 1983 to 1986. The “Vrdolyak 29” blocked the mayor’s appointments and voted down his legislative initiatives, while voting themselves control of every committee on the City Council – though they were too few in number to override Mayor Washington’s veto.

Vrdolyak ran unsuccessfully against Mayor Washington in 1987 on the Illinois Solidarity Party ticket. He then switched to the Republican Party and ran unsuccessfully for Cook County Circuit Court Clerk in 1988.

In 1989, Vrdolyak ran for mayor as a Republican in a special election following Mayor Washington’s death. He was trounced in that race by Democrat Richard M. Daley and went back to practicing law afterward.

Vrdolyak also hosted a talk radio show in the 1990s, and was also a key adviser to former Cicero Town President Betty Loren-Maltese, who was convicted in a scheme to loot the western suburb’s treasury.",admits to fraud

Muhammad Saad Iqbal
Department of Defense photograph
Born October 17, 1977 (age 43)
Detained at Bagram and Guantanamo
Alternate name Hafez Qari Mohamed Saad Iqbal Madni
ISN 743
Charge(s) No charge (held in extrajudicial detention)
Status Repatriated September 8, 2008

Muhammad Saad Iqbal is a Pakistani citizen who was held in extrajudicial detention in the United States Guantanamo Bay detention camps, in Cuba. [1] Madni's Guantanamo Internment Serial Number was 743. The Department of Defense reports that he was born on October 17, 1977.

Madni was arrested in Jakarta after he asked about the whereabouts of an American official, prompting accusations that he intended to assassinate the individual. After six months in captivity, he attempted suicide and was subsequently relabeled as ""non-compliant"" by his captors.

He was released in 2008 after six years imprisonment, and returned to Pakistan. His government said that he would not face any criminal charges, and that he was returning to his life. On 19 August 2009, the UK arm of the legal charity Reprieve commenced legal action on behalf of Madni, seeking information from the UK government about whether Madni had been rendered through Diego Garcia.

Rendered to Egypt for torture[ edit ]

Main article: Combatant Status Review Tribunal

Muhammad Saad Iqbal was among the 60% of prisoners who participated in the tribunal hearings. [2] A Summary of Evidence memo was prepared for the tribunal of each detainee. The memo accused him of the following: [3]

a The detainee is a member of al Qaida.

The detainee is an al Qaida operative.
The detainee ascertained the plans and movements of a US government official for the purpose of inflicting harm of death to that official.
The detainee claimed prior knowledge of a terrorist act
The detainee engaged in planning of and surveillance for, a proposed terrorist act.

Transcript[ edit ]

The Department of Defense published a 13 summarized transcript from his 2004 CSR Tribunal. [3]

Testimony[ edit ]

Madni told his Tribunal that he was wearing the orange jumpsuit that non-compliant captives were made to wear because of a suicide attempt he had made on the 191st day of his detention.

Publication of captives' CSR Tribunal documents[ edit ]

In September 2007 the Department of Justice published dossiers of unclassified documents arising from the Combatant Status Review Tribunals of 179 captives. [4] A habeas corpus petition was filed on behalf of "" Muhammed Saad Iqbal Madni"" on December 13, 2005. [5] But his dossier was not one of those the DoD published.

Administrative Review Board[ edit ]

Detainees whose Combatant Status Review Tribunal labeled them ""enemy combatants"" were scheduled for annual Administrative Review Board hearings. These hearings were designed to assess the threat a detainee might pose if released or transferred, and whether there were other factors that warranted his continued detention. [6]

First annual Administrative Review Board[ edit ]

A Summary of Evidence memo was prepared for Hafez Qari Mohamed Saad Iqbal Madni's first annual Administrative Review Board on October 19, 2005. [7] The two page memo listed nine ""primary factors favor[ing] continued detention"" and zero ""primary factors favor[ing] release or transfer"". Those factors included denunciations from unnamed informants that he claimed to be a member of al Qaida, that he plotted assassinations, that he was related to a female member of the extremist Ak Ikhwan Al Muslimoon Group in Indonesia, and that he had stated:

The detainee stated it was better to kill one U.S. Government Official than 100 Americans.

Madni chose to participate in his Administrative Review Board hearing. [8]

Preliminary meeting with Assisting Military Officer[ edit ]

Madni's preliminary meeting with his Assisting Military Officer took place on November 29, 2005. Madni said he would attend. His Assisting Military Officer described him as responsive, polite and attentive, during this meeting, but highly skeptical, based on his experience Combatant Status Review Tribunal.

Second annual Administrative Review Board[ edit ]

A Summary of Evidence memo was prepared for Hafes Qari Mohammed Saad Iqbal Madni's second annual Administrative Review Board on October 19, 2005. [9] The two page memo listed nine ""primary factors favor[ing] continued detention"" and two ""primary factors favor[ing] release or transfer"".

In addition to the allegations listed on the earlier memos the 2006 memo stated he had visited with members of al Qaida in Jakarta, Indonesia, that he met the Secretary General of the Islamic Defenders Front, that he had seen weapons at the house of his new militant acquaintances, and he had been told about two failed terrorist attacks in which they had participated—an attempt to use a car bomb against the US embassy, and an attempt to attack an airliner. One factor offered as a justification for his further detention stated:

The detainee stated that because of his ability to memorize and sing the Koran at the age of twelve he became famous in Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, he was introduced to presidents, kings and princes. The detainee stated that he won approximately five million dollars in prize money from Koran competitions.

Third annual Administrative Review Board[ edit ]

A Summary of Evidence memo was prepared for Hafes Qari Mohammed Saad Iqbal Madni's annual Administrative Review Board on December 27, 2007. [10] The two page memo listed just four ""primary factors favor[ing] continued detention"" and two ""primary factors favor[ing] release or transfer"".

All four of the factors favoring his continued detention concerned a leadership role he played in a student group, the Sipah-e-Islam Pakistan, which was an adjunct to a violent anti-Shi'a group, the Sipah-e-Sahaba Pakistan. The factors stated these two groups followed the Deobandi School, and were created in reaction to the Iranian revolution, and that the SSP group was behind the assassination of the Iranian Ambassador to Pakistan in the early 1990s. More recently the groups organized political rallies.

The factors favoring his release or transfer stated that he feared being returned to Pakistan, and that:

The detainee stated that with regard to his relationship to a known jihadists, he made a mistake when he got involved with bad people at a young age.

Earlier allegations that he personally was involved in hostile acts were all dropped in this memo.

One January 9, 2009, the Department of Defense released two heavily redacted memos, from his Board, to Gordon R. England, the Designated Civilian Official. [11] [12] The Board's recommendation was unanimous The Board's recommendation was redacted. England authorized his continued detention on March 17, 2008.

A writ of habeas corpus was filed on Hafez Qari Mohamed Saad Iqbal Madni's behalf.

The Military Commissions Act of 2006 mandated that Guantanamo captives were no longer entitled to access the US civil justice system, so all outstanding habeas corpus petitions were stayed. [13]

Boumediene v. Bush[ edit ]

On June 12, 2008 the United States Supreme Court ruled, in Boumediene v. Bush, that the Military Commissions Act could not remove the right for Guantanamo captives to access the US Federal Court system. And all previous Guantanamo captives' habeas petitions were eligible to be re-instated. The judges considering the captives' habeas petitions would be considering whether the evidence used to compile the allegations the men and boys were enemy combatants justified a classification of ""enemy combatant"". [14]

Protective order[ edit ]

On 15 July 2008 Kristine A. Huskey filed a ""NOTICE OF PETITIONERS' REQUEST FOR 30-DAYS NOTICE OF TRANSFER"" on behalf of several dozen captives including Iqbal. [15]

Repatriation[ edit ]

A former Guantanamo captive named as ""Qari Saad Madni"" was repatriated on September 8, 2008. [16] [17] Pakistani officials stated he would soon be released without charge, following a debriefing. The Associated Press reported that Madni claimed he had tried to commit suicide during his first year in detention.

On September 19, 2008 Richard L. Cys, James P. Walsh filed ""Petitioner Muhammed Saad Iqbal Madni's response to court order to show cause why his petition should not be dismissed as moot"", as part of 05-CV-2385, on behalf of Muhammed Saad Iqbal Madni. [5] Madni's lawyers argued his habeas petition should not be dismissed because he was entitled to continue to seek relief if his original detention was not legally justified. Further, his lawyer had not been advised of the conditions agreed upon by the US Government and the Pakistani Government:

Undersigned counsel have no knowledge regarding the terms and conditions of the agreement under which Mr Madni's physical custody was transferred to Pakistan. Respondents have not submitted any evidence to the court regarding the nature of Mr Madni's transfer or his current status in Pakistan. Accordingly, undersigned counsel does not know whether as part of his transfer the United States required that Mr Madni continue to be imprisoned, or after what period of time or under what conditions he might be released. Furthermore, undersigned counsel does not know whether Mr. Madni has at all times since his transfer remained imprisoned in Pakistan.

On 5 January 2009 the New York Times published a profile of Mohammed Saad Iqbal. [17] The profile chronicled serious health problems during and after his repatriation, and was illustrated with a picture of him standing in a walker. The New York Times reported that senior US officials were prepared to confirm aspects of his account of himself—off the record. They informed the New York Times that, shortly after he had apprehended in Jakarta, during his first two days of interrogation analysts had decided he was a braggart and ""wannabe"" and should be immediately released:

He was a talker. He wanted to believe he was more important than he was.

He was first transferred for four months to a brutal interrogation center in Egypt, where he was housed in a 4 x 6-foot (1.8 m) cell he said ""like a grave"", and subjected to electric shocks during his interrogation. [17] He was then transferred, for a year to the Bagram Theater Internment Facility.

He described harassment from other captives because he had never trained in Afghanistan. [17]

Richard L. Cys of Davis Wright Tremaine is seeking relief for his long detention without charge, and for the release of his medical records, which may document his torture claims. [17]

CIA spokesman Paul Gimigliano denied Madni had been subjected to illegal treatment: [17]

The agency's terrorist detention program has used lawful means of interrogation, reviewed and approved by the Department of Justice and briefed to the Congress. This individual, from what I have heard of his account, appears to be describing something utterly different. I have no idea what he's talking about. The United States does not conduct or condone torture. [17]

We are almost certainly going to have an inquiry into the 1993 dealings of Brian Mulroney and Karlheinz Schreiber. The inquiry has a narrow focus and will not deal with other possible corrupt practices by our former prime minister.

Since the inquiry will cover the Schreiber $300,000, the Ethics committee should focus on other matters, such as:

- The huge amounts of cash given to the Mulroneys during his years as PM: how much he got, how much they spent, where it came from, whether the Mulroneys paid tax on it.

- The money Frank Moores said he was collecting to give Mulroney after he was prime minister. How much was this? Was there a quid pro quo?

- Airbus. Where did the $20 million earmarked for Canadian schmiergelder go?

Due to the diligence of investigative journalists Stevie Cameron and Harvey Cashore, we know that Airbus, Thyssen and Messerschmitt Bolkow-Blohm earmarked tens of millions to influence the Canadian government during the Mulroney years. We need to start connecting some dots. We know Frank Moores lobbied for Airbus to help them get Air Canada to buy planes; we know Brian Mulroney appointed Frank Moores to the board of Air Canada just before the Airbus vote, but Moores was forced to resign because of a public scandal; we know Mulroney made other dubious appointments to the Air Canada board; we know that on February 4, 1986, Schreiber and Giorgio Pelossi opened two Swiss bank accounts, one each for Moores and Mulroney. All this has been in the public domain for years. We need to get testimony on these issues under oath and then we need someone to decide what it all adds up to.

- The 1983 Tory leadership covention where Schreiber chartered planes and bribed delegates to vote for Mulroney, apparently bankrolled by far-right Austrians and arms dealers: how many delegates were given free flights or bribed; who exactly was behind this and why; who besides Frank Moores was in on it; what did Mulroney know.

- Whether Mulroney should return the $2.1 million defamation suit settlement, given that he appears to have lied under oath during the proceedings. (David Johnston left this issue out of his recommendations for the inquiry.)

The Ethics committee should from now on put every witness under oath. They should consider granting immunity to witnesses, if that is possible.

In addition to the Ethics committee hearings and the inquiry, I urge investigative journalists and/or the RCMP to look into the wider issue of who else got bribes and who else paid bribes.

Schreiber has said that the ministries of transport and defence are where most of the graft is collected: those two ministries have the big-money contracts that can net the minister and other decision-makers the big kickbacks. During the Mulroney years, did the ministers of transport or defence have any extra spending money? Each big contract should be investigated. It seems pretty clear that the Mulroney government was into extraremuneratory deals, and it's very likely that the shennanigans went on with other nogoodnicks besides Karlheinz Schreiber.

A serial fraudster pretended to be a police officer and a lawyer in order to con three vulnerable women out of thousands of pounds.

Stephen Davey of Rumney Road West, in Kirkdale, used two false identities, 'Stephen Burns' and 'Simon Davey', as part of his elaborate plot.

The women, who cannot be named, included a single mother who thought Davey could help her through a family court case after she suffered from domestic abuse.

However, the conman went on to steal a total of nearly £8,500 from his victims between January to April this year, leaving them feeling ""extremely vulnerable and anxious"".

Today he was handed four years behind bars for the crimes, after the judge described him as a ""dishonest fraudster"" with an ""appalling criminal record"".

The 49-year-old has 17 previous convictions for 94 offences, 57 of which are fraud offences and 37 for theft.

He pleaded guilty at Liverpool Crown Court to counts 1,2,4,5 and 6 on August 16.

Fraudster seduced woman at sports bar

Prosecuting, Nardeen Nemat, told of how Davey met his first victim at the start of December 2018 when he began regularly attending a sports bar in Liverpool.

It was there that Stephen Davey introduced his fake identity to the victim, as 'Stephen Burns' - a police officer, offender manager and probation worker.

Over the following months Davey convinced the woman that he was in love with her. In order to borrow money from her, he told her that he was in the process of buying a house for the pair of them to live in.

The woman went on to ask Davey if he would help her friend, a victim of domestic violence, who was going through the Family Courts to retain custody of her children.

The court heard how Davey said his friend ‘Simon Davey’ was a family law solicitor and would help her friend who was struggling to pay for legal representation.

Mum betrayed in her hour of need

However, Simon Davey did not exist and over the next four months he used this fake identity to take payment from the woman, having promised to ‘represent her’ at court.

He also claimed he had ‘hired a private investigator’ to follow her ex-husband, and charged her for the service. In total he took £8,000 from her.

Davey told the woman not to attend court and that ‘Simon Davey’ would represent her in her absence, but no one attended, leaving her unrepresented.

Even after this, Davey carried on the fiction, telling the woman that she’d been granted full custody of her children and compensation, when this was not true.

He also told her on occasions to keep her children off school and produced fake legal documents and emails from Warrington Borough Council about her ex-husbands parental rights.

Still claiming to be a police officer, Davey went on to send the woman fake screenshots claiming that they were from the police.

He said that the police were involved in an operation to arrest one of the women’s ex-husband for 14 offences, including terrorism and possession of indecent images of children.

He also forged a fake email from the Chief Constable of Merseyside Police, claiming that her ex-husband was going to be arrested.

Prosecuting, Nardeen Nemat, told of how between January 2019 and April 2019 Davey asked for and obtained money from the victim on a regular basis.

This included £400-500 for private health scans, after Davey claimed that he feared he may have bowel cancer and that waiting for a scan on the NHS would take too long.

A second victim

Davey was then introduced to another friend of the two women who was also in family law proceedings against her ex-husband following domestic abuse.

He also referred the woman, who wanted a non-molestation order to be put in place to protect herself and her daughter, to 'Simon Davey' in exchange for £475.

But despite the woman being told the order was now in place to protect them, no application was ever made.

The court heard of how Davey's crimes were finally discovered after staff at the Tune Hotel in Castle Street, where he was staying, became suspicious and googled his name.

The search brought up a series of news articles about earlier frauds he’d committed, prompting a member of staff to confront him via Whats App.

Davey never returned to the hotel, abandoning his possessions and staff contacted the police.

His bedroom was searched by the police and various articles were recovered that he’d used as part of his frauds, including police lanyards and files provided by the women to ‘Simon Davey’.

Nardeen Nemat, prosecuting, said: “Stephen Davey is a serial fraudster whose behaviour showed a disregard for the havoc and heartache he created in the lives of the people he conned.

“The women thought he was trying to help them with difficult family problems, yet he just made things so much worse.

""By telling the women that his ‘solicitor friend’ was dealing with the Family Court matters and that they didn’t need to attend Court, he could have derailed their hopes of maintaining custody of their children.

“His behavior was reckless and heartless. Thankfully the women found the courage and perseverance to support this prosecution and help the Crown Prosecution Service build a strong case – so strong that Davey pleaded guilty at an early stage.""

Kids can't understand where 'Stephen Burns' has gone

In a victim impact statement read out by the prosecution, the first mother said she was seeking assistance from the family courts after an abusive relationship but she no longer trusts police, social services or legal representation as a result of Davey's actions.

She described how guilty she feels for allowing her children to get to know Davey and that they don't understand why they can't see 'Stephen Burns' again.

The victim says she feels ""extremely vulnerable and anxious"" since the incident and has since been referred for counselling and given strong medication for her anxiety.

The court also heard how the second mum has been left feeling anxious and has suffered panic attacks at work where she has broken down and cried as a result of Davey's actions.

Prosecution, Nardeen Nemat, told of how the victim has previously been in a violent relationship and had been subject to mental torture.

And now thanks to Davey's actions, she has been left feeling more vulnerable than ever before and fears that her daughter could be kidnapped.

She has also been left struggling to trust the police and says she is constantly looking over her shoulder.

'He is disgusted with himself'

Defending, Tom Watson, said: ""He does accept that the two victims have suffered and have suffered as a result of what he has done and he does not wish them to suffer any further.

""The defendant knows this court will look at his record and see something of a life of crime and he does not attempt to deny that but he does attempt to give some form of apology for his behaviour.

Defence, also told the court of how an email had been sent by Davey's mother to illustrate ""the frustrations and difficulty that he faces when he tries to get on with his life lawfully. The internet follows him around.""

The court heard how Davey, who has two children aged 21 and 23, enrolled on a online BA degree in Criminology and Psychology in 2015 because ""he does want to make something more of himself"".

Judge Warnock, said: ""The matter is complex and tortuous because you took complex and tortuous actions against your victims.

""The real harm in this case is the affect it had in the case involving these children.

""You have an appalling criminal record, you are a dishonest fraudster. You have been committing this type of offence for a long time with 94 offences for 17 convictions starting in 1987.

""The time has come for you to stop committing fraud and harm to others.""

Stephen Davey was sentenced today to four years in jail, with 25% credit given for his early guilty plea.

This included a consecutive sentence of 2.5 years for count one and 1.5 years for count two.

He was also handed an 8 month concurrent sentence on counts four and five and 6 months on count six.

The court imposed a 10-year restraining order, which states that Davey must not contact any of the women or go to their addresses.

The restraining order also covers the Tune Hotel in Castle Street where Davey had been living at the time he committed his offences.",fraud and theft

The National Police said on Friday they would not arrest two Indonesian nationals who were recently added to the list of global terrorists by the US government for their links to what it considered Indonesian-based terrorist organizations.
National Police spokesman Insp. Gen. Ronny F. Sompie said that the police would not take any action unless Washington filed a formal request through the National Central Bureau (NCB)-Interpol Indonesia. 'As far as I know,
we haven't heard any official information about that from the US government. I don't know if the National Police Chief has heard any of it,' he said.
On Wednesday, the US Treasury Department issued a press release stating that it had included two Indonesians, Afif Abdul Majid and Said Ahmad Sungkar, on its Specially Designated Nationals (SDN) list for their alleged involvement in providing financial support for Jamaah Islamiyah (JI) and Jamaah Anshorut Tauhid (JAT), labeled by the US government as terrorist groups.
NCB-Interpol said that they had not received any special notice about the matter from the Interpol system, through which the member countries could share any urgent information about international crimes.
The US Treasury Department has said that JI and JAT still posed threats because the two groups, which were established and inspired by firebrand cleric Abu Bakar Ba'asyir, had links to the international terrorist organization al-Qaeda.
'The threats posed by terrorist groups such as JI and JAT remain significant. We will continue to take action to protect the international financial system from illicit activity tied to these groups, making it ever more difficult for them to carry out their acts of violence,' US Treasury's Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence David S. Cohen said in a statement.
Afif, who lives in Pacitan, East Java, allegedly provided funding to a terrorist camp and oversaw its recruitment process. As a member of JAT's consultative council (majelis syuro), he allegedly urged JAT fighters to take violent action against the National Police, according to the US treasury's statement. The US authorities said Afif donated US$2,000 to support the Aceh terrorist training camp in early 2010.
Afif said that he was not concerned about the US move to designate him a terrorist. 'I am just a preacher, it is impossible for me to have any assets in the US,' he said, adding that he preached from mosque to mosque and there had never been any problems with his activities.
Meanwhile, Said, who lives in Pekalongan, Central Java, is being accused of providing financial, material or technological support to both JI and JAT. The department has also found that he had recently conducted fund raising and recruiting for JAT in 2013.
Said did not understand the accusation leveled against him by the US government, saying 'I have not even dreamed of being a JI or JAT member,' as quoted by tempo.co.id.
Said admitted, however, that he had a close relation with JAT founder Ba'asyir, whom he regarded as his teacher. 'He was my teacher and we often preached together before he was taken to prison,' he added.
Disgraced cleric Ba'asyir was sentenced to 15 years' imprisonment after being proven to have planned and raised up to Rp 1.39 billion ($125,358) for a terrorist training camp in Aceh.
In February last year, the US Treasury Department included another three JAT members in its terrorist list. They were JAT spokesman Son Hadi bin Muhadjir and two JAT members Mochammad Achwan and Abdul Rosyid Ridho.
Son Hadi accused the US government of slander, saying that its counterterrorism operation was just a disguise to take Indonesia's natural resources and wealth.
Insp. Gen. Arif Darmawan of the National Counterterrorism Agency (BNPT) said that his agency would not directly help the US government should they ask them to arrest the two suspects or designees.
'We haven't received any information. In addition, we will not do whatever they want. We will verify the accuracy of the information. They also need to coordinate with the Foreign Ministry and the police before making any request,' he said.

Actress Lori Loughlin and her fashion designer husband, Mossimo Giannulli, were indicted on fraud and money laundering charges Tuesday in the multimillion-dollar college admissions cheating scam that has ensnared dozens of wealthy parents trying to get their kids into the nation's most prestigious colleges.

The ""Fuller House"" star and her husband, along with 14 other parents, were charged in Boston in a ""second superseding indictment with conspiring to commit fraud and money laundering,"" the Department of Justice said in a statement to Fox News.

Loughlin and Giannulli were charged last month with conspiracy to commit mail fraud. The new indictment adds a money laundering charge for all 16 defendants.

FELICITY HUFFMAN TO PLEAD GUILTY IN COLLEGE ADMISSIONS SCANDAL: 'I AM ASHAMED OF THE PAIN I HAVE CAUSED'

Loughlin and Giannulli are accused of paying $500,000 in bribes to get their daughters admitted to the University of Southern California as crew team recruits, even though neither of them played the sport.

A rep for Loughlin did not immediately return Fox News' request for comment. She and her husband appeared in a Boston federal court briefly last week and were not asked to enter a plea. The couple has not publicly commented on the allegations.

More than four dozen people have been charged in the nationwide scam, which is alleged to have placed students in top-tier schools like Yale, Georgetown, Stanford, the University of Southern California, UCLA and the University of Texas. A federal investigation into the matter – dubbed ""Operation Varsity Blues"" – has been ongoing for more than a year.

The move comes a day after fellow actress Felicity Huffman, 12 other parents and a coach agreed to plead guilty — signaling an escalation in the case against the parents who are continuing to fight the allegations against them.

On Monday, the ""Desperate Housewives"" actress announced her decision to plead guilty, explaining that she accepts ""full responsibility"" for her actions.

""I am pleading guilty to the charge brought against me by the United States Attorney's Office,"" the ""Desperate Housewives"" alum said in a statement obtained by Fox News.

""I am in full acceptance of my guilt, and with deep regret and shame over what I have done, I accept full responsibility for my actions and will accept the consequences that stem from those actions,"" Huffman continued. ""I am ashamed of the pain I have caused my daughter, my family, my friends, my colleagues and the educational community. I want to apologize to them and, especially, I want to apologize to the students who work hard every day to get into college, and to their parents who make tremendous sacrifices to support their children and do so honestly.

""My daughter knew absolutely nothing about my actions, and in my misguided and profoundly wrong way, I have betrayed her. This transgression toward her and the public I will carry for the rest of my life. My desire to help my daughter is no excuse to break the law or engage in dishonesty,"" she concluded.

Prosecutors say they will seek a prison sentence that's on the low end of between four and 10 months for Huffman.",

A group of fraudsters from the East of England who conned more than 50 people out of millions of pounds were today (26 April 2019) sentenced to a combined total of 21 years in prison at Southwark Crown Court.

The group ran a ‘boiler room’ scam from 2014 to 2016, convincing elderly and vulnerable people to invest in fake companies. Some people were scammed more than once and one 83-year-old lost over £1m.

After a number of concerned victims contacted police, an investigation was launched by the Eastern Region Special Operations Unit (ERSOU). Forensic Analytics provided expert witness testimony on behalf of the prosecution.

Barry Spearing, 58, from Suffolk was jailed for six years and Muhammad Tanveer, 30, from Romford, received a seven year sentence. Shaun Cross, 30, from Orpington and Ryan Weston from Wisbech, were jailed for four years and three years respectively. Accomplices Lucy Richardson, 25, Mandy Cross, 59, from Oprington, Mark Bowman, 55, from Whitley Bay and Philip Hunt, 32, from Norfolk all received suspended sentences.

A ‘boiler room’ fraud sees criminals cold calling or emailing their victims pretending to be from an established and legitimate company to persuade them to invest in worthless or non-existent stocks, often using high pressure sales tactics.

Detective Chief Inspector Liz Fernandes, who led the investigation, said:“These ruthless criminals conned many innocent people out of money they had worked hard for throughout their careers, tricking them into investing into non-existent companies and stocks. The sentences handed out today can never make up for the traumatic impact this has had on the lives of the victims, but we hope that it has brought them some closure. This was an incredibly lengthy and complex investigation and our officers have worked tirelessly in bringing these offenders to justice and ensuring they will remain behind bars for a considerable amount of time.”",fraud

A corrupt lawyer who helped a buy-to-let landlord use dirty money to fraudulently build a £10.8million property empire has been jailed for seven years.

Father-of-three Ross McKay, 39, was the conveyancing solicitor who gave a 'veneer of respectability' in a series of illicit properties deals masterminded by Scott Rowbotham.

Businessman Rowbotham, of Stalybridge, Greater Manchester, managed to build up a portfolio of 88 properties with the help of McKay.

Manchester Crown Court heard the pair's scheme yielded £10,842,271 and police managed to seize £3.5million of it in the biggest haul in British history.

The pair's trial also heard McKay represented crime lord Billy Black, who was friends with one-eyed police killer Dale Cregan. Black is currently serving 22 year for fraud and drugs offences.

Rowbotham accumulated around £500,000 a year in rent from his property empire, getting mortgage lenders to hand over huge amounts by lying about his income.

He told clients he was an operations manager for a TV company with a salary of £48,000 a year - but the fake pay slips covered up the reality - that he had only declared £1,000 in income and £18.20 in tax over 11 years.

Rowbotham's girlfriend was also pocketing £20,000 in tax credits at the time.

McKay, of Wilmslow, Cheshire, who worked for Parker Birds law practise in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire after qualifying in 2004 carried out the conveyances on a 'no questions asked basis' for 81 of the criminal properties belonging to Rowbotham knowing it would enable him to build up a large property portfolio and to live lavishly off the proceeds.

Rowbotham drove a Range Rover Sport while Burns had a Mercedes C220 AMG Sport.

McKay was arrested in 2014 during an investigation by police and tax officials into the financial affairs of Rowbotham and his associates following Cregan convictions the previous year for murdering two policewomen and two gangland rivals.

It emerged the lawyer had also been laundering money for a shell company used as a front by crimelord Billy Black who is currently serving 22 years in jail for fraud and drugs offence.

At Manchester Crown Court McKay, of Wilmslow, who now runs a solo consultancy was convicted of money laundering following a seven week trial.

He denied wrongdoing. Another lawyer acting on behalf of 52-year old Black was jailed for nine months at an earlier hearing.

Sentencing him to seven years in prison, Judge Timothy Smith told McKay: ' You were expected to be of the utmost integrity and honesty in your role.

'Any applicant for a solicitor must comply with 10 practices, including to uphold the rule of law, act with integrity, and comply with legal obligations.

'These convictions mean you fall short of the qualities expected of a solicitor. You were consistently in breach of each requirement of a solicitor, and failed as your duty to uphold the law.

'In trial you portrayed yourself as being an average solicitor, one that helped to support your family but any outward show of professionalism was a charade.

'You allowed criminal property to be obtained and assisted these people in organised crime.

'You must have known or suspected in continuing to provide them with legal services.

'You were turning a blind eye and you knew the money you were dealing with was criminal property.

'Any case in which the court sees a mature professional man with young children is a tragic one.

'Although the consequences will be harsh and will affect your family, the tragedy is not yours, it is theirs.

'There has been for you as a solicitor a fall from grace. This will have a devastating effect on your family. The professionalism you had will not be there anymore.'

The court heard Rowbotham had claimed to be an operations manager for a TV company earning £48,000 a year to get loans when in reality he had earned only £1,000 in declared income and paid just £18.20 in tax in an eleven-year period.

Nick Clarke QC prosecuting said: 'In brief McKay a practising solicitor throughout, carried out the conveyances on the vast majority of criminal properties belonging to Rowbotham and Burns knowing or suspecting it would enable them to build up a large portfolio of criminal property and to live an expensive lifestyle off the proceeds.

'Properties currently held in Rowbotham's name in which McKay acted as the solicitor, obtained during the years 2005 -2008 show a purchase price total of over £6.6 million. Others were new builds for which we have no price.

'In order to buy the properties Rowbotham obtained mortgages and Re-mortgages amounting to millions of pounds obtained through mortgage fraud.

'The total deposits have come from criminal activities of himself and others and cannot be explained by any legitimate and honest employment.

He also obtained mortgages by purporting to sell properties he already owned to other people including his long-term partner, mother of his long-term partner and other associates, in order to raise finance.

'McKay received his instructions from Rowbotham. After Rowbotham's criminal property empire was complete, the defendant was recruited to assist in the management of a loan company, in part used as a front for money laundering some of the proceeds of Billy Black's criminal activities.

'The Company received over £250,000 which after laundering through the company was repaid to Black through dividends and income.

'The role of the defendant was to add a veneer of respectability to the management of that company and the idiosyncratic payment of dividends and wages.

The court heard the total benefit from the frauds was £10,842,271.

Police seized £3,522,459 in assets from Rowbotham - one of the biggest proceeds of crime recoveries in Britain.

In mitigation defence lawyer Mark Rhind said: ' It is sad when a mature man comes before the court with his first conviction and to face his first custodial sentence.

'It is even more sad when he is of good character and has a young family who will suffer badly.

'When that man is a lawyer and facing the end of his career and and may face financial ruin is a tragic set of circumstances.

'Rowbotham had hatched this scheme and was doing this before McKay became involved.

'He would apply for mortgages with false details and McKay had knowledge of that.

'They were all tainted properties and came from Rowbotham being able to buy them.

'McKay may have closed his mind to what the jury believed what in front of him - but he wouldn't ask questions.

'The criminality became obvious over time as Rowbotham kept putting in deposits but he simply closed his eyes to what was in front of him.

Mr Rhind added: 'He had given his training contract at the law firm as the boss had just left but the supervision was like a light touch and he was in his early 20s and was left to create a business with little supervision.

'He led the practice on his own and it clearly went badly wrong - it was when he was young, inexperienced and left to his own devices.

'There was nobody in the conveyance department that was qualified other than him. As soon as he was arrested he was unemployed as a solicitor.

'His wife has worked to support the family but she is in debt with tax and the mortgage.

'They now have no family income as she is looking after the new child. She is unable to return to work as she has to look after the children. This will be an extremely difficult sentence for a man of his age to deal with.'

Rowbotham, of Stalybridge was jailed for three years and eight months at an earlier hearing after he admitted fraud and money laundering between 2004 and 2014.

Council revenues assistant Burns, 36, was given a suspended sentence and is reported to be running Rowbotham's letting operation.",jailed for corruption related to illicit properties deals

CHICAGO (CBS) — Knowing he would soon be sentenced for a brazen $23 million scam involving scores of phony pieces of sports memorabilia, an Arkansas con man looked at his oldest son in court and said, “I screwed it up.”

Pausing and tapping his fingers on a table, John Rogers explained that he cut a deal with the feds that led him to wear a wire against dangerous people — even killers — because he hoped it would help him get out of prison in time for the high school junior’s last year of college.

Then the feds caught him selling fake merchandise all over again this fall, putting an end to any such hope. U.S. District Judge Thomas Durkin called the move “monumentally stupid” on Wednesday, moments before he hammered Rogers with a 12-year sentence for a fraud of “breathtaking” proportions.

He did so after Rogers also admitted, “I didn’t think of my son when I was doing these things.”

When the hearing ended, Rogers gave a thumbs-up to the boy, who quickly left the courtroom where he had earlier called his father his “hero.”

First charged in September 2016 for a scheme to use a fake Billy Sims Heisman Trophy as collateral for a $100,000 loan, prosecutors say Rogers was more recently involved in a “new wave” of fraud that involved a phony Super Bowl I game ball and even “a fake Mickey Mantle silverware set.”

Rogers, 44, wound up in federal jail here after a hearing on the matter last month.

Rogers said he set out to create “fantasy items” — replicas — that would never fool the public. But he said he fell back into his old ways. He and his attorney, J. Blake Hendrix, also said Rogers has long battled a drug addiction. Rogers tested positive for cocaine in October, according to Hendrix, and Rogers said he brought cocaine along when he traveled to Chicago for last month’s hearing.

“I know my words are shallow and may not be believed,” Rogers said.

Rogers pleaded guilty to wire fraud last March. He made the fake Sims Heisman using an honorary Heisman given to announcer Al Helfer in 1960. He swapped out the trophy’s nameplate but ignored a dent on the left side of its base, as well as scratches and other marks. He also failed to replace a missing screw.

The feds say Rogers had at least 26 victims, stealing $23 million that he must now pay back in restitution. He said more fake merchandise remains on the market.

Rogers’ case followed a yearslong FBI investigation into sports memorabilia auction houses such as Mastro Auctions in the western suburbs. Rogers secretly recorded Doug Allen, the former president of Mastro Auctions, who was sentenced to 57 months in prison last year. Hendrix also said Rogers wore a wire on other “very bad people.”

Meanwhile, Rogers said he realized he had put himself in a position where he could no longer be a proper father to his children.

But Durkin told Rogers, “I can’t care more about your children than you did.”",sentenced

A former Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agent known for his lavish lifestyle was arrested Friday on charges of conspiring to launder money for the same Colombian drug cartel he was supposed to be investigating.

Authorities arrested Jose Irizarry and his wife at their home near San Juan, Puerto Rico. Federal prosecutors say in a 19-count indictment that the 49-year-old used ""his position and his special access to information” to launder millions in drug profits.
They both posted $10,000 bail and were released.
“It’s a black eye for the DEA to have one of its own engaged in such a high level of corruption,"" said Mike Vigil, the DEA's former chief of international operations. ""He jeopardized investigations. He jeopardized other agents and he jeopardized informants.""
Irizarry had been a model agent after joining the DEA in Miami in 2009. He was entrusted with an undercover money-laundering operation using front companies, shell bank accounts and couriers. Irizarry resigned in January 2018 after being reassigned to Washington when his boss in Colombia became suspicious.

Previous reports by The Associated Press detailed his alleged wrongdoing last year.
“His fingerprints are all over dozens of arrests and indictments,” said David S. Weinstein, a former federal prosecutor in Miami. “It could have a ripple effect and cause courts to re-examine any case he was involved in.”
Authorities said Irizarry filed false reports and misled superiors while directing the DEA to wire funds intended for undercover operations to accounts in Spain and other countries. The accounts were either controlled by him or connected to his wife and co-conspirators, prosecutors said.

The money funded a lavish lifestyle that included the purchase of a $30,000 Tiffany diamond ring, a BMW, three Land Rovers and a $767,000 home in Cartagena, as well as homes in south Florida and Puerto Rico, where the couple has been living.
A red Lamborghini with the same vehicle ID named in the indictment belongs to Jenny Ambuila, who was arrested last year in Colombia along with her father, Omar Ambuila, a customs agent in the port of Buenaventura, a major transit point for cocaine and contraband goods used to conceal the proceeds of narcotics sales. Before her arrest, Ambuila shared photos and videos of herself on Facebook posing next to the red sports car, which is valued at more than $300,000.
￼
One of two unnamed co-conspirators in the indictment is Diego Martin, a relative of Irizarry's wife, The AP reported. Martin is considered one of the top money-laundering suspects in Colombia over the past decade, according to U.S. and Colombian officials.
He was arrested in 1993 for allegedly hiding money for the Cali cartel in home appliances bound for Colombia. He was never charged and eluded prosecution ever since by leveraging relationships built over decades as an informant to multiple U.S. law enforcement agencies, the officials said.
The indictment comes a week after another DEA agent was sentenced to four years in prison for smuggling drugs from Puerto Rico to New York.

Investors defrauded by Reed Slatkin hope to recover funds from Scientology groups
Los Angeles Times, Mar. 26, 2003
http://www.latimes.com/
By E. Scott Reckard, Times Staff Writer

Investors defrauded of $255 million by EarthLink Inc. co-founder Reed Slatkin are hoping to recover funds from the Church of Scientology International and six affiliated organizations that allegedly wound up with tens of millions of dollars from the investment scam, their attorneys said Tuesday.

The investors won an initial battle when a bankruptcy judge in Santa Barbara recently refused to block subpoenas ordering the Scientology groups to hand over records of money transferred to them by certain Slatkin investors who came out ahead financially. The subpoenas also seek records of communications the groups had about Slatkin, a longtime but now excommunicated Scientologist who was known for his celebrity clientele.

Investors burned by Slatkin’s schemes have sued individuals who profited, including supermodel Cheryl Tiegs and actor Peter Coyote. But the subpoenas mark the first legal targeting of church entities. No suits have been filed against the church or the affiliates. Attorneys expect months of legal wrangling before the subpoenas might yield anything.

Lawyers for the church groups, who sought to block the subpoenas, won a partial victory from U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Robin Riblet, who is overseeing Slatkin’s bankruptcy. The judge ruled Friday that they can participate in the subpoena process. That will allow the groups to mount further legal challenges and to have access to any documents that are made public.

Church of Scientology attorneys will confer with the Chapter 11 bankruptcy trustee on the material that should be released through the subpoenas, “and to the extent the subpoenas seek to violate religious protections of communications between the church and its members, we will object,” said Joseph Eisenberg, a lawyer for the church.

One of the claims made to try to block the subpoenas was that details of money transfers are protected by “clergy-communicant privileges” — the status accorded to the confessing of sins to a priest. But attorneys for the trustee and the committee of unsecured creditors questioned in court documents “how a simple monetary transfer, where no communication was involved, would violate any clergy-communicant privileges.”

In pleading guilty to fraud last year, Slatkin described his investment empire as a scam from its start in 1986. Lawyers for the trustee and the creditors contend that proves the “profits” he distributed were ill-gotten, whether the investors knew it or not, and must be returned.

Legally, there is no protection for third parties such as the Church of Scientology if it can be shown that they received supposed profits from Slatkin, said Alexander Pilmer, an attorney for the trustee and creditors. He added that there’s a potential for significant recoveries from the organizations.

“We believe that Scientology entities received tens of millions of dollars from Slatkin or from Slatkin’s Ponzi scheme,” Pilmer said.

In a report to the Bankruptcy Court, trustee R. Todd Neilson calculated that investors poured $593 million into Slatkin’s investment pools. Neilson wants to recover as much as possible of the $195 million that investors received as purported profits.

Slatkin pleaded guilty nearly a year ago to fraud, money laundering and conspiracy charges carrying a potential sentence of up to 15 years. The co-founder of the Internet service provider EarthLink is in federal custody, trying to win a lesser sentence by cooperating with prosecutors. Sentencing is set for June 9.

Slatkin’s plea agreement allowed him to request a lighter sentence because of what the plea agreement called the “psychological impact of his association with certain individuals and/or groups,” a reference to his membership in the Church of Scientology and long and close relationship with some prominent members.

Linda Simmons Hight, a spokeswoman for the church in Los Angeles, said Slatkin “used his position in the church to suck in Scientologists who were victimized along with other people.”

Pilmer said dozens of people who profited from Slatkin’s scheme have settled the claims. The latest settlement, approved Friday by Riblet, was with CNN legal commentator Greta Van Susteren and her husband, tobacco litigator John Coale. They agreed to pay about $700,000 — about 81 cents on the dollar for the profits Slatkin paid them.",fraud

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Honduran politician Juan Antonio “Tony” Hernandez was found guilty of U.S. drug trafficking charges on Friday after a two-week trial that featured dramatic accusations of corruption against his brother, the Central American nation’s president.

The verdict against Hernandez, 41, on all counts was handed up by a jury in federal court in Manhattan. He is scheduled to be sentenced on Jan. 17 and faces up to life in prison.

“They reached a verdict that was inconsistent with the truth,” one of Hernandez’s lawyers, Omar Malone, told journalists outside the courthouse. “We plan to appeal on behalf of Mr. Hernandez.”

Members of Hernandez’s family who attended the trial were swarmed by protesters as they left the courthouse. Some protesters chanted “Fuera JOH,” meaning “Out with JOH,” referring to Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez.

Tony Hernandez was arrested in Miami in 2018 and charged with drug trafficking and possessing illegal weapons. U.S. prosecutors accused him of helping smuggle almost 200,000 kilograms (220 tons) of cocaine into the United States while enjoying the protection of his brother. President Hernandez has repeatedly denied the allegation.

In a Twitter post, he said that he received news of the verdict with “great sadness.” The verdict was “based on testimonies of confessed murderers,” referring to former drug traffickers who cooperated with U.S. authorities in the trial.

The two-week trial featured testimony from Honduran drug traffickers who are now in U.S. custody and cooperating with authorities, including, Amilcar Alexander Ardon, a former mayor, and Devis Leonel Rivera Maradiaga, former leader of Honduras’ Cachiros gang.

Some of the most explosive testimony was from Ardon, who told jurors that Tony Hernandez promised Mexican drug lord Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman protection for his shipments in exchange for a $1 million donation to his brother’s presidential campaign in 2013.

Rivera Maradiaga, who admitted to murdering 78 people, testified that he paid bribes to multiple officials including Juan Orlando Hernandez.

Tony Hernandez’s lawyers urged jurors not to trust the prosecutors’ cooperating witnesses, describing them as career criminals willing to lie to get their prison sentences reduced.

The president, who began his second term in January 2018 amid allegations of electoral fraud, has not been charged with a crime. He has represented himself as tough on narcotics and responsible for breaking up the six most powerful cartels in Honduras and extraditing 24 traffickers to the United States. He said traffickers were using his brother’s trial to seek revenge.

Honduras is under pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to curb migration to the United States. Honduras and the United States struck a deal last month on asylum seekers.","bribe, drug trafficking"

Who Is Ivan Boesky?

Ivan Boesky, a renowned American arbitrageur, came to epitomize the “greed is good” mantra during the 1980s era of financial excess. A major player in the hostile takeover and junk bond craze, and financial superstar, he became an inspiration for Gordon Gekko in Oliver Stone’s 1987 movie, ""Wall Street""—before going to prison for his role in a 1986 insider trading scandal.

Key Takeaways

Ivan Boesky is a former investment banker who was convicted of insider trading in 1986 and fined a record $100 million.
Boesky made his money in the 1980s through investing in the stocks of companies that were primed for takeover.
He embodied the 1980s junk bond boom, in which leveraged buyouts of companies were financed by junk debt, and a life of excess and greed were the norm.
As part of his conviction, he served over three years in jail and informed on a number of his former colleagues and associates.
His conviction and that of his colleagues led to the passage of the Insider Trading Act of 1988, which increased the fines for securities violations.

Understanding Ivan Boesky

Ivan Boesky, the son of a Detroit strip club owner, rose to power and fame as the world’s leading takeover arbitrageur and made a fortune investing in stocks of companies that were takeover targets. A public figure and author of "" Merger Mania: Arbitrage, Wall Street's Best Kept Money-Making Secret,"" he was unapologetic about the pursuit of money. In 1986, in a graduation speech at the Berkeley School of Business, Boesky said; ""Greed is all right, by the way, greed is healthy…You can be greedy and still feel good about yourself."" It was a line that would be immortalized by Gordon Gekko.

It was also a message that chimed with the neoliberal economic policies Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher had embarked upon. Corporate takeovers and downsizing were just the tickets for restructuring ossifying and highly unionized old industries. Boesky was, for a time, feted by the financial media, and his gospel of greed was much in demand on the speaking circuit. However, the Boeskys were nouveau riche parvenus, known for their conspicuous consumption, but not necessarily their good taste.

In 1987, Boesky suffered a spectacular and abrupt fall from grace when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission announced he had been using confidential inside information on upcoming deals—channeled through one of his underlings, investment banker Denis Levine—and was charged with illegal stock manipulation. These takeover targets included Nabisco Brands Inc., General Foods Corp., and Union Carbide Corp.

Boesky Brings Down the Curtain on the 1980s Junk Bond Boom

It was the end of an era of roaring corporate takeover activity and leveraged buyouts funded by junk debt. If all the raiders and junk bond traders were engaged in illegal activity, who would buy all these companies at their inflated prices?

As part of a plea bargain deal—in which he received a prison sentence of over three years and a $100 million fine—Boesky ratted on his tipster friends, including junk bond king Michael Milken. Boesky’s testimony would bring Milken and his junk bond firm Drexel Burnham Lambert to justice. Drexel had fueled the leveraged buyout boom through junk bonds and was famous for its predators' ball, an investment gala for corporate raiders, and financiers.

Milken would pay over a billion dollars in fines and restitution and served two years in jail. The following year, Congress increased the penalties for securities violations when it passed the Insider Trading Act of 1988. Boesky never recovered his reputation and was permanently barred from working in the securities industry.",insider trading
TMML202403798581,Philip Righter,"Alert ID: TMML202403798581
A West Hollywood man accused of attempting to sell fraudulent paintings to a South Florida gallery was sentenced to five years in prison by a Miami federal court on Wednesday.

Philip Righter, 43, pleaded guilty to three felony charges—wire fraud, aggravated identity theft and tax fraud—in a case filed in Los Angeles. He admitted to selling works he falsely claimed were created by artists such as Andy Warhol, Jean-Michel Basquiat, Keith Haring, Kurt Schwitters and Roy Lichtenstein. According to a statement from the US Attorney’s office, Righter also admitted to using the fake art as collateral for loans on which he later defaulted, and using “bogus” pieces for fraudulent write-offs on his income tax returns.

In total, Righter’s scheme attempted to swindle buyers out of around $6m, and he caused losses of at least $758,265 known to date. Additionally, his fraudulent tax returns resulted in $100,000 of unpaid taxes to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), according to a plea agreement in the case.

In addition to the five-year felony sentence, US District Judge Marcia G. Cooke of the Southern District of Florida also handed down another sentence of 60 months in federal prison in another case involving Righter filed by prosecutors in Miami. Righter pleaded guilty in that case in March and admitted trying to sell Haring and Basquiat forgeries to the owner of a Miami art gallery, which remains unnamed in the court documents. Both sentences will run concurrent to each other.

Righter ran a fraud scheme in California up until 2018, in which he attempted to sell counterfeit or fake art as genuine works by famous artists. To make the pieces appear authentic, he used custom-made embossing stamps that were similar to those used by the estates of Basquiat and Haring on provenance documents he created, according to court papers. He also created fake gallery labels falsely identifying works as having been purchased from the New York-based Annina Nosei Gallery, a real dealership known for selling works by Basquiat and other artists.

In a bid for leniency from the judge, Righter’s defense attorney suggested that there was nothing “especially complex” about his fraud scheme, as the US Attorney claimed. ""Mr Righter simply logged onto the Internet and purchased artwork from, among other sources, eBay,” the documents say. “All that was required was a computer with an Internet connection and some knowledge of these well-known artists’ styles, works, and biographies, as well how letters of authenticity and provenance documents look and function (which could also be achieved through a series of Internet searches). The Haring and Basquiat estate embossing seals, though designed by Mr Righter, were also simply ordered from a commercial rubber stamp company.""

Yet Righter’s schemes grew increasingly more complicated and malicious. At first, he sold the works under his own name, but when he was interviewed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Art Crime unit and the Los Angeles Police Department about a fake Haring work he tried to sell to the unnamed Miami gallery in 2016, he began using the names of other people and organisations, the court documents say.

Also, Righter received or tried to obtain numerous loans by using the fake art and provenance documents. For instance, in February 2016, he submitted an application to an online lender, identified as “P.G.” in the court documents, a made up provenance document identifying a work as Roy Lichtenstein’s Seductive Girl (Study), saying it had been purchased for $103,200, and another work he said was by Keith Haring, which turned out to be a fake. The lender agreed to provide a loan of $5,000 against the Haring. When Righter defaulted on the loan, the lender sold the work through Leslie Hindman Auctioneers for $50,000; the auction house lost $35,351 on the transaction when the fraud was later discovered. Similarly, in August of that same year, Righter obtained a $270,000 loan against the fake Lichtenstein from another lender identified as “E.C.”. Once again, Righter defaulted and the lender took the work to an unnamed auction house, which deemed it a fake.

The court documents also outline several attempts by Righter to sell fake works of art. In May 2017, under the names of a father and son duo, he offered a UK buyer two works purportedly by Basquiat totalling over $1m. The collector wired Righter a deposit of £120,000 ($151,484) before discovering the works were fakes.

And in August of the same year, once again using another person’s name, Righter listed a piece purported made by Basquiat in 1983 with the word “Samo”—the artist’s well known street tag—written on it with an art sale website identified as “A.B”, providing fake provenance documents he said were from Annina Nosei gallery. The website sold the piece for $50,000 to a buyer in Dubai. In 2018, after the piece was determined to be a fake, the website had to refund the purchase price to the buyer and lost the $37,970 that they had already sent to Righter for the sale (minus the site’s commission) for a total loss of around $88,000. Righter also sold another purported Basquiat to an Arizona buyer through the website for $90,000, whom the website also had to refund.

In 2018, under yet another person’s name, Righter attempted to sell two more purported Basquiat works to a gallery identified in the court papers as “S.W. Gallery”, which offered him $990,000 for both. The gallery discovered that the works were fraudulent before the sale went through, after contacting Annina Nosei directly to verify the certificates of authenticity.

Righter also admitted to the court that he knowingly and willfully included a false W2 and documentation of a donation of fake art to a charity on his 2015 federal income tax return, which resulted in him receiving a refund of $54,858. Righter then signed and filed a false 2015 amended tax return, in which he claimed a loss of $2,575,000 related to art he said had been stolen. In truth, the art was fake and had no value. This fraudulently amended tax return resulted in carryback refunds for 2012, 2013 and 2014 totalling $52,485, according to court documents.

In the Florida lawsuit, Righter offered to sell the fraudulent Basquiat and Haring works to a South Florida gallery, auction houses and others under another name. When the gallery owner showed interest, Righter (who was still in Los Angeles) shipped a number of the forgeries to a warehouse in South Florida. Righter’s price for the forgeries was $1,056,000 and he directed the gallery owner to wire the money to his own bank account. He pleaded guilty to one count of mail fraud and one count of aggravated identity theft. The works in both cases have been seized by the FBI.",

		Tech mogul Robert Brockman has been charged in a $2 billion tax evasion case, the biggest in US history, the Justice Department said Thursday.
		Brockman hid $2 billion in income from the Internal Revenue Service over two decades, according to an indictment unsealed on Thursday.
		He was charged after fellow billionaire Robert Smith turned against him to avoid prosecution himself, the Justice Department said.
		Brockman faces seven counts of tax evasion, six counts of failing to file reports disclosing foreign bank accounts, and counts of wire fraud, money laundering, and evidence tampering.

Houston technology executive Robert Brockman has been charged in the biggest-ever tax evasion case against a US citizen, after fellow billionaire Robert Smith turned against him to avoid prosecution himself, the Justice Department said on Thursday.
Brockman, the 79-year-old chief executive of Ohio-based Reynolds and Reynolds Co, hid $2 billion in income from the Internal Revenue Service over two decades, using a web of off-shore companies in Bermuda and St. Kitts and Nevis, according to an indictment unsealed on Thursday.
Reynolds and Reynolds provides software used by auto dealerships to help manage their business.
The indictment alleges Brockman appointed nominees to manage the off-shore entities for him as a means of hiding his involvement, saying he even went so far as to establish a proprietary encrypted email system and use code words such as ""Permit,"" ""Red fish,"" and ""Snapper"" to communicate.
At a press conference in San Francisco, US Attorney David Anderson said Brockman was also charged in a securities fraud scheme, after he bought and sold debt securities in his own company, ""breaking a promise to investors that he would not buy or sell his own company's debt.""
The debt was purchased thanks to inside information Brockman possessed, Anderson added.
He faces seven counts of tax evasion, six counts of failing to file reports disclosing foreign bank accounts, and numerous other counts including wire fraud, money laundering, and evidence tampering.
""Mr. Brockman has pled not guilty, and we look forward to defending him against these charges,"" Brockman's attorney Kathryn Keneally said in an emailed statement.
A spokesman for Smith, who founded private equity firm Vista Equity Partners, could not be reached immediately for comment.
Anderson said Smith, who helped secure the charges against Brockman and famously announced at last year's Morehouse College commencement that he would pay off the college debt of 2019 graduates, accepted responsibility for his own crimes in the tax evasion scheme.
Brockman and Smith have a business relationship dating back to the late 1990s, according to documents filed in connection with Smith's non-prosecution agreement.
Brockman, who is referred to as ""Individual A,"" became an investor in Smith's private equity fund in 2000, first with a $300 million commitment, and later increasing it to $1 billion.
As part of his non-prosecution agreement, Smith admitted to using a nominee trustee and corporate manager to hide his control in four off-shore companies. Some of his untaxed income was used to buy a vacation home in Sonoma, California, and ski properties in the Alps, and to fund charitable causes, Anderson said.
He will pay $139 million in taxes and penalties, and will abandon a $182 protective refund claim and pay interest as part of the deal.
""Although Smith willfully and knowingly violated the law, Smith has accepted responsibility and agreed to provide complete and truthful cooperation,"" Anderson said.

Syrian tycoon Rami Makhlouf issued a video statement on Sunday saying officials had told him to quit as head of mobile operator Syriatel, in the latest twist in a tussle over assets and taxes that has uncovered a rift at the heart of the ruling elite.

Makhlouf, a cousin of President Bashar al-Assad, said he would resist the pressure and refuse to step down as chairman – even though he said the officials had threatened to revoke the firm’s licence and seize its assets if he did not comply.

There was no immediate comment from the authorities.

Makhlouf, once widely considered part of the president’s inner circle and the country’s leading businessman whom the U.S. Treasury said was the front man for Assad’s family wealth, has a business empire that ranges from telecoms and real estate to construction and oil trading.

He played a big role in financing Assad’s war effort, Western officials have said, and is under U.S. and EU sanctions.

But the video message – the third he has issued on the dispute in less than a month – underlined divisions that Syria experts say could mark the first major rift within the minority Alawite sect that has ruled the country since Assad’s uncle Rifaat tried to depose Assad’s father, the late president Hafez, in 1984.

He accused security forces earlier this month of arresting his employees in an “inhumane way” in an unprecedented attack from within the authoritarian system by one of the country’s most influential figures.

In the statement issued on Facebook, Makhlouf said officials, who he did not name, had told him: “If you don’t comply … the licence will be revoked”.

“They said you have until Sunday to either comply or the company will be taken and its assets seized,” Makhlouf said, adding they were threatening board members with arrests. It was not immediately clear when the video was recorded and which Sunday he was referring to.

He said there would be a “catastrophic” blow to the economy if Syriatel, a major source of revenue for the state, collapsed.

The Syrian pound fell to a record low of 1,750 to the dollar on Sunday with fears the rift would further damage an economy already hit by tougher U.S. sanctions and reeling from the damaging impact of the financial crisis in neighbouring Lebanon, which choked a main source of dollars into the country.

In Sunday’s message, Makhlouf who rose to prominence in the decade before the conflict in 2011, attacked war profiteers whom he said had moved in during the war. Senior businessmen say their growing role sanctioned by top officials has weakened Makhlouf’s once dominant position.

“Those who had been before the war are concerned about the country and sacrificed with everything they have,” Makhlouf said.

The billionaire has been under U.S. sanctions since 2008 for what Washington calls public corruption and it has since toughened measures against top businessmen who are close to him.

The European Union has also slapped sanctions on Makhlouf since the Syrian conflict began in 2011, accusing him of bankrolling Assad.",

WASHINGTON—Joseph Hirko, former co-chief executive officer of Enron Broadband Services (EBS), Enron’s failed telecommunications business, was sentenced today to 16 months in prison, announced Assistant Attorney General Lanny A. Breuer of the Criminal Division.

In addition to the prison term, U.S. District Court Judge Vanessa Gilmore ordered Hirko, 53, of Portland, Ore., to forfeit approximately $7 million in restitution to victims through the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s Enron Fair Fund, in accordance with the terms of the plea agreement. Hirko pleaded guilty on Oct. 14, 2008, in U.S. District Court in Houston to one count of wire fraud charged in a superseding indictment.

In July 2005, Hirko and four other EBS executives were tried on various charges of conspiracy to commit securities and wire fraud, securities fraud, wire fraud, insider trading and money laundering relating to their employment at Enron. The trial resulted in a mistrial, and Hirko was subsequently charged in a superseding indictment with wire fraud, securities fraud and insider trading. According to the superseding indictment and the plea agreement, Hirko participated in Enron’s annual analyst conference in Houston at which Enron introduced EBS as one of its “core” units. Enron also announced the development of a broadband operating system or “BOS.” According to the plea agreement, the BOS was purported to be an “intelligent” operating system and was described as, among other things, a standard protocol for accessing real-time bandwidth.

As alleged in the superseding indictment, Enron issued a press release on May 15, 2000, announcing the acquisition of Warpspeed Communications. According to Hirko’s guilty plea, the Warpspeed release falsely represented the status of the BOS and implied that it was already embedded and functioning as a part of Enron’s network. Specifically, the Warpspeed release stated that the BOS “allows application developers to dynamically provision bandwidth on demand for the end-to-end quality of service necessary to deliver broadband content.” According to the plea agreement, Hirko reviewed and approved this language even though the Warpspeed release contained material inaccurate representations regarding the BOS’s status. In doing so, Hirko admitted that he acted with reckless indifference to the true facts, including: that the BOS was under development throughout his employment at Enron; that it was never embedded on Enron’s network; and that it could not dynamically provide bandwidth on demand or provide for the end-to-end quality of service necessary to deliver broadband content. According to the plea agreement, Hirko’s approval of the Warpspeed release, as well as other press releases, assisted in maintaining Enron’s overall stock price, thereby improperly maintaining the value of Hirko’s holdings of Enron stock.

This case was prosecuted by Senior Litigation Counsel Jack B. Patrick, Senior Trial Attorney Jonathan E. Lopez and Trial Attorney Liam B. Brennan of the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section.

Charges against the EBS employees were initially brought in March 2003 by the Enron Task Force, a team of federal prosecutors and agents formed to investigate matters related to the collapse of Enron. All remaining Enron Task Force cases are now being handled by the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section, with the investigatory assistance of the FBI.",fraud

Securities and Exchange Commission v. Brett Kennedy, et al. (No. 17-cv-01344) (W.D. Wash., filed Sept. 7, 2017)

Former Amazon Employee and College Friend Charged with Insider Trading

The Securities and Exchange Commission today announced insider trading charges against a former Amazon financial analyst who allegedly leaked confidential information to his former fraternity brother in advance of a company earnings announcement so they could turn an illegal profit. The college friend and his trading partner also are charged in the SEC's complaint.

The SEC alleges that Brett Kennedy accessed nonpublic 2015 first quarter earnings information without authorization while working at Amazon and shared it with Maziar Rezakhani, who illegally traded on the financial results before their public release to make more than $116,000 in illicit profits. According to the SEC's complaint, Rezakhani paid Kennedy $10,000 in cash for the tip and also shared the trading profits with Sam Sadeghi, who was advising him on his brokerage account trades and joined Rezakhani at a meeting with Kennedy to discuss the nonpublic information. The SEC's complaint alleges that Rezakhani and Sadeghi aimed to establish a successful track record with the trading in Rezakhani's brokerage account and together open a hedge fund in New York that would accept investments from others.

According to the SEC's complaint, Rezakhani boasted on at least two trading-related internet communication platforms in the days leading up to Amazon's earnings announcement that he was predicting first quarter revenue of $22.7 billion and earnings per share of -$0.12, writing that the ""numbers are so obvious"" that a ""5 year old can guess what they will do.""

The SEC's complaint, which was filed in the Western District of Washington, charges Kennedy, Rezakhani, and Sadeghi with violating Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and seeks permanent injunctions along with the return of allegedly ill-gotten gains plus interest and penalties against Rezakhani and Sadeghi.

Sadeghi and Kennedy agreed to settlements that are subject to court approval. Without admitting or denying the allegations, Sadeghi agreed to pay disgorgement of $11,599.74 plus $1,035.39 in interest and an $11,599.74 penalty for a total of $24,214.87. Kennedy agreed to pay disgorgement of $10,000 plus interest of $875.36. Sadeghi and Kennedy both agreed to be enjoined from further securities law violations. In a parallel action, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Washington today announced criminal charges against Kennedy.

The SEC's investigation was conducted by Sallie Kim and supervised by Steven Buchholz of the San Francisco office. The litigation against Rezakhani will be led by Ms. Kim and Mr. Buchholz.

A judge told the disgraced former MP that he had “thrown away his good name and character” with “blatant dishonesty” and “lies”.

Despite a high-flying job as a junior environment minister, the 58-year-old fraudulently claimed £800-a-month interest on mortgage payments on his constituency home in Lincolnshire.

MPs are allowed to claim interest on their mortgages, but the actual monthly interest Morley paid was only ever between £6 and £52.

He even carried on claiming the £800 after his mortgage was paid off.

In total he claimed £32,000 when, under parliamentary expenses rules, he was only entitled to £1,572.

At London’s Southwark Crown Court Mr Justice Saunders said: “I am satisfied from the nature of the mortgage transactions and the correspondence that the excessive claims were made deliberately and are not explicable, even in part, by oversight.

“The continuation of the claim for £800 a month after the mortgage had been redeemed can properly be described as blatant dishonesty.”

He added: “The results of this case are tragic for the defendant and his family. He has thrown away his good name and good character.”

Morley, a father of two who was elected MP for Scunthorpe in 1987 and stood down before last year’s general election, admitted two counts of false accounting.

The admission made him the first minister and most high-profile politician to be caught in the scandal.

Peter Wright QC, prosecuting, said under parliamentary expenses rules, Morley was entitled to claim mortgage interest on his second home in Winterton, Lincs.

But, in fact, the Liverpool-born MP “engaged in the wholesale abuse of the expenses system”, submitting a total of 40 fraudulent claims.

Between May 2004 and February 2006, he submitted 19 claims worth £15,200, and between March 2006 and November 2007 he submitted 21 claims totalling £16,800.

After receiving a letter from the parliamentary fees office, Morley explained his behaviour as an “embarrassing and inadvertent oversight”.

Jim Sturman QC, mitigating, said that Morley had paid back the full amount owed immediately.

He said: “This is a tragic end to a lifetime of public service. He has done an enormous amount of good, often for no pay.

“He’s made a grotesque error of judgment.”

Mr Justice Saunders said Morley avoided a longer jail sentence despite claiming more money than other MPs who had also been convicted over the expenses scandal because of the lack of sophistication of his fraud.

He said: “While this defendant is charged with obtaining more money than any other MP and over a long period, the degree of sophistication involved in carrying out the fraud was less than in some other cases.”

Matthew Sinclair, director of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: “Morley’s jail sentence is justice for taxpayers whom he cheated and stole from.

“The damage done by the MPs’ expenses scandal is still being repaired and it will take time to restore the public’s trust in the system, but this is another step down that road.

“This sentence sends a clear message that even a former minister is not above the law, and stealing from the taxpayers he was supposed to represent is a very serious crime.”

A Labour Party spokesman said: “Elliot Morley had already been suspended from the Labour Party and following his custodial sentence, he has now been excluded.”",expenses fraud

What is one to make of the secret activities of the Habsburg Group?

In 2011, following Viktor Yanukovych’s election as Ukraine’s president, then U.S. political consultant Paul Manafort was hired to develop plans to promote the international political goals of the new leader in Kiev.

Yanukovych sought strong support from West European governments and from the U.S. Congress and the White House.

The plans and their funding were to be kept strictly secret. Over four years, at least $11 million was spent by Manafort. The money was distributed via a host of shell companies in a dozen jurisdictions to lobbyists that he recruited on both sides of the Atlantic — at least $2 million went to the Hapsburg Group.

Manafort explained to Yanukovych that this was a “A super VIP group of former heads of European governments and VIP officials.”

Gusenbauer, Prodi and Kwasniewski

Details of Manafort’s operations were disclosed last Friday in documents presented to the federal court in Washington, D.C. by the U.S. Justice Department on behalf of U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller.

Significantly, immediately prior to the court filing, on September 13, 2018, Manafort agreed to plead guilty to a obstruction of justice and a catch-all “conspiracy against the United States,” which include failing to register as a lobbyist for a foreign government.

He has plenty of reasons to cooperate with the U.S. government now, given that just a few weeks ago Manafort was found guilty of charges that included bank fraud, $30 million of money laundering and $15 million of tax evasion.

The EU’s left supports Ukraine’s right wing?

The VIP team that Manafort created is referred to repeatedly in the court documents as the Habsburg Group, which is coordinated by former Austrian Chancellor Alfred Gusenbauer. Leading members include former European Commission President and former Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi, as well as former Polish President Aleksander Kwasniewski.

Politically, two facts are surprising: First, these politicians are all prominent left-of-center politicians. Second, they became highly active advocates of the right-wing Yanukovych regime.

Denials so far

According to U.S. media reports, they have either refused to comment on the allegations or denied suggestions that they secretly took cash to promote the interest of Ukraine.

The court papers noted, just as an example, that the team promoted the interest of the Ukraine government in meetings in the three months from November 2012 to February 2013 with, among others: European Parliament (EP) leader Martin Schultz, French foreign minister Laurent Fabius, senior EU and IMF officials.

Plans were set for meetings with senior U.S. government officials, which other court documents show did take place later in 2013.

Manafort’s Connection

The former European political leaders who worked under the auspices of the Habsburg Group had multiple contacts with Paul Manafort. It is surprising that they apparently asked few questions about the ways in which they were being paid, through offshore shell companies, and why Manafort insisted that his name never be mentioned in any of their dealings on behalf of Ukraine.

Manafort will go to prison and he will pay a steep fine. In contrast, the European officials and former political leaders that he employed are unlikely to face investigations, let alone their days in court.

This is astonishing, especially considering that they may have violated laws, and/or acted in ways that are counter to the ethical standards of the governments or international institutions that at differing times they represented.

Conflicts of interest

For example, Aleksander Kwasniewski was allegedly receiving cash as a member of Habsburg Group at the same time as he co-led a European Parliament (EP) mission to Ukraine to monitor conditions there.

The then-EP President Martin Schultz declared at the time: “The mission’s reputation of impartiality and independence is a great asset to both the EU and to Ukraine, and it is part of a process of increasing engagement, which has to continue.”

The Commission had positive things to say about Ukraine, which must have brought a wide smile to Manafort’s face.

Why not a European Parliament investigation?

So, will there be a serious European Parliament investigation now into what was so clearly a conflict of interest?

I doubt it. After all, over the last five years there appears to have been 24 cases of so-called ethics complaints involving EP members, but nobody has been sanctioned.

Many of the likely conflicts of interest of European politicians are not nearly as complex as the schemes that Manafort devised. Rather, they may well relate to outside commercial interests of elected parliamentarians.

The disclosure guidelines governing investments and outside business income of elected parliamentarians across most of Europe are overly general and rarely, if ever, effectively monitored.

In some parliaments in Europe, such as Germany and the UK, there are no serious requirements on members to disclose information about consulting work they may be doing on the side and who their clients might be.

European political ethics

The disclosures in the Manafort papers ought to set off some alarm bells in Europe. At a minimum, it should launch a serious conversation in European capitals and in the European parliament about conflicts of interest, about the ways they are prevented and about the enforcement of ethics regulations.

It would be worthwhile as well to review whether or not there should be regulations regarding the ways in which top politicians operate, and lobby, after they leave office.

At a time of growing populism, it does not sit well with the public at large that politicians often state they seek the public’s trust, but are then prepared to abuse their power as they scheme to get rich.

Clearly, they should neither be able to operate with impunity, nor assured that their unethical actions will not be investigated, let alone prosecuted.

Manafort to tell all

Meanwhile, perhaps the Habsburg Group members will now have a few sleepless nights. The documents that have been filed in U.S. court are the start, not the end of public disclosures.

Paul Manafort is about to start talking to the U.S. Special Counsel in a desperate effort to earn some mercy as he currently faces at least 10 years in jail.

Manafort agreed as part of his plea deal to “cooperate fully, truthfully, completely, and forthrightly with the Government and other law enforcement authorities identified by the Government in any and all matters as to which the Government deems the cooperation relevant.”

To the undoubted horror of president Trump, Manafort will undoubtedly be asked by Robert Mueller to reveal everything he knows about possible deals and connections between the Trump election campaign, in which he served as chief manager for several months in 2016, and Russians.

He may also be asked to provide far more details about the law firms, banks, consultants, and former European politicians he paid over the years as he secretly and unlawfully lobbied for Ukraine’s Viktor Yanukovych.",corruption

Who Is Michael Milken?

Michael Milken is a philanthropist and current chair of a nonprofit think tank called Milken Institute. Milken was an executive at investment bank Drexel Burnham Lambert during the 1980s and used high-yield junk bonds for corporate financing and mergers and acquisitions. Milken amassed an enormous personal fortune and was indicted in 1989 by a federal grand jury and eventually spent nearly two years in prison after pleading guilty to charges of securities fraud. While he is credited with founding the high-yield debt market, he was banned for life from the securities industry.

Key Takeaways

Michael Milken is a philanthropist and current chair of a nonprofit think tank called Milken Institute.
He joined Drexel Burnham Lambert in 1969 and started trading in high-yield bonds which earned him the nickname Junk Bond King in the 1980s.
Milken was indicted and spent nearly two years in prison after pleading guilty to charges of securities fraud.
Milken was banned for life from the securities industry.

Understanding Michael Milken

Milken joined Drexel Burnham Lambert in 1969. It was during his time with the firm that he started trading in high-yield bonds which earned him the nickname Junk Bond King in the 1980s. These bonds provide much-needed capital for companies that don't necessarily have ready access to credit. During his time at the firm, he was able to raise a huge amount of money from a sizable base of interested investors. This allowed him to eventually expand his high-yield bond department. At the height of his success, Milken earned between $200 million and $550 million a year.

On April 24, 1990, Milken plead guilty to five technical counts of violating securities laws. He was sentenced to 10 years in federal prison, but was released after two years for good behavior. He was also fined $600 million. Since his release, Milken has been remaking his image and is attempting to secure a pardon for the charges he plead guilty to in 1990.

Following his release from prison, he worked as a strategic consultant. This was in violation of his probation, and he was subsequently fined $42 million for these actions. In 1993, Milken was diagnosed with prostate cancer. Since then, he has devoted much of his time and resources to the pursuit of a cure for the disease.

After being released from prison, Milken was fined for working as a consultant—a violation of his probation.

According to Forbes, Milken's net worth is estimated at $3.7 billion as of September 2019. He co-founded the nonprofit Milken Family Foundation as well as the Milken Institute, an economic think tank that hosts conferences around health, politics, media, and culture.

Special Considerations

Early in his career, Milken saw an opportunity to leverage junk bonds, also known as high-yield bonds. He saw a way for investors to see high returns—on a risk-adjusted basis—by buying bonds that were issued by companies with low credit ratings compared with acquiring bonds from AAA-rated companies. At the time, the availability of such bonds was limited and Milken anticipated demand would quickly outpace supply for this investment opportunity. The firm he worked for, Drexel Burnham Lambert, launched an effort to underwrite more junk bonds by convincing such companies to issue them.

The companies in question may have been early-stage or otherwise not well-established. Their low credit rating may not necessarily have been a result of poor financial health, but rather from a lack of an extensive track record to base their credit ratings on. Such circumstances are typically seen with new and emerging industries. From the companies’ perspective, issuing bonds was a way to potentially access more capital that they might not otherwise have an opportunity to pursue. Milken’s efforts at Drexel Burnham are credited with launching this market.

As the junk bond market grew, Milken sought to maintain a dominant position over this sector, and some of his efforts led to engaging in business activities that eventually led to his arrest and conviction for securities fraud.",securities fraud

The Cachiros were one of Honduras’ largest transport groups, with a net worth close to $1 billion. Made up of a family of former cattle rustlers, the organization became a major player in the movement of cocaine between Colombian and Mexican organizations.

The group is thought to have bought drugs from Colombian organizations, possibly in Nicaragua, as well in their native Honduras. They then moved the cocaine to the Sinaloa Cartel and other Mexican groups.

The Cachiros had large business and political interests that reached to the top of the Honduran elite. They had strong contacts in the military and the police at their service — particularly in their former stronghold in Colón.

The Honduran government had mostly ignored the group until recently. However, the United States government took a special interest in the Cachiros, targeting the group’s assets and pushing the Honduran government to seize somewhere between $500 million to $800 million in properties in September 2013. In a deal reportedly negotiated with the US Drug Enforcement Administration, the two leaders of the Cachiros surrendered to US authorities in January 2015, initiating the end of the group’s reign.

History

The Cachiros began as small-time cattle rustlers. Operating along the Olancho–Colón border, the Rivera Maradiaga brothers, apparently with their father’s blessing, began stealing and reselling cattle. Their own properties expanded with time, and at some point in the late 1990s or early 2000s, they teamed up with the largest underworld figure in the area, Jorge Anibal Echeverria Ramos, alias “El Coque.”

Coque was well positioned both financially and politically. He dated one of then-Congressman Ramon Lobo’s daughters, Margarita. His group was a tight crew in a small town. The oldest Rivera Maradiaga, Javier, dated Coque’s sister. For his part, Lobo owns scores of land in the region, although no one has formally linked him to criminal activities.

At some point, Coque and the Rivera Maradiaga family had a squabble that turned bloody. The first attempt on Coque’s life happened in San Pedro Sula. He survived. The second attempt occurred in Costa Rica. Again, he survived but was subsequently deported to Honduras and jailed. Three days after being imprisoned, he was assassinated.

With Coque out of the way, the Cachiros took over. Javier ran the operation. They began running regular shipments from Gracias a Dios to western Honduras or Guatemala, where they would hand off the merchandise to Mexican buyers or their Guatemalan counterparts.

The timing was propitious. The Mexicans were taking over more of the distribution chain, channeling their product through the isthmus. Honduras was also going through political turmoil. In 2009, President Manuel Zelaya was removed from power by the military and ushered from the country. The interim government that followed spent most its time dealing with the resulting political upheaval. Drugs flowed freely, and Honduras became a major bridge between the Colombian and Mexican drug trafficking organizations.

The Cachiros took advantage, charging between $2,000 and $2,500 per kilo they moved. They also took control of aerial drug routes: a 2013 US Treasury Department Kingpin Designation claimed the group controlled 90 percent of the clandestine airstrips in Honduras. The profits have been enormous, as the 2013 seizures by the Honduran government illustrated.

The leaders of the Cachiros are currently in the custody of US authorities. During his trial in New York, Devis Leonel Rivera Maradiaga accepted his participation in the murder of 78 people, including the anti-drug czar Julián Arístides Gonzáles, former National Security Advisor Alfredo Landaverde and journalist Anibal Barrow. In addition, his statement implicates members of the political and economic elite in drug trafficking and bribery activities. Among those involved are members of the powerful Rosenthal family, the late Honduran tycoon Mauricio Facussé, the brother of the current president of Honduras, Antonio “Tony” Hernández, and former President Porfirio Lobo and his son Fabio.

And those implicated by Rivera Maradiaga’s testimony have started to fall.

In July 2017, Yani Rosenthal pleaded guilty in a US federal court to one money-laundering charge as one US attorney said he “moonlighted as a money launderer for a ruthlessly violent drug trafficking organization known as the Cachiros.” And in August, Yani’s cousin, Honduras’ former investment minister Yankel Rosenthal, also pleaded guilty in a US court to laundering money for the Cachiros organization. Additionally, Fabio Lobo, the son of former Honduras President Porfirio Lobo, who pleaded guilty in 2016 to conspiring to import cocaine into the United States, was sentenced to 24 years in a US prison for drug trafficking with the Cachiros.

Rivera Maradiaga’s 2017 testimony also revealed that the current president’s brother and former congressman, Tony Hernández, accepted $50,000 in bribes from the Cachiros in exchange for the government paying a debt to a company used by the drug cartel to launder money.

Tony Hernández was arrested by DEA agents in Miami in November 2018 on charges of drug trafficking. Hernández’s was found guilty in October 2019 after a trial in New York.

Another case linked to the Rivera Maradiaga testimony is that of a former regional commander of Honduras’ special criminal investigations unit (Dirección Nacional de Investigación Criminal – DNIC), Carlos Alberto Valladares Zuñiga. Valladares was charged in 2018 with having conspired with Los Cachiros to protect the group’s drug trafficking activities, eliminated rivals, and recruited police officers to provide logistical support and security.

Additionally, former Honduras congressman Midence Oquelí Martínez Turcios has been charged with controlling drugs flowing from Colombia through Honduras and onto Mexico. US authorities have requested Martínez Turcios’ extradition.

Since the Rivera Maradiaga brothers’ trial in 2017, Honduran authorities have continued to seize a number of assets and properties linked to the Cachiros organization and their partners, a sign that investigations into the group’s illicit activities may still be ongoing and that additional criminal charges could be brought against new suspects in the future.

Leadership

The Cachiros were known as a tight-knit, family-run operation, contracting out much of their work to locals, to whom they owed little allegiance and with whom they had little contact; this minimized their risk if any individual cell were to have been compromised.

The group’s alleged leaders were Javier Eriberto Rivera Maradiaga, alias “Javier Cachiro,” and his brother Devis Leonel Rivera Maradiaga.

Fears of being killed in Honduras prompted both brothers to turn themselves in to the DEA in January 2015. Javier Rivera pleaded not guilty to drug trafficking charges in February.

According to Honduran media reports, the last leader of Los Cachiros, Hernán Natarén, was killed along with his wife in July 2016.

Geography

The group operated in the Colón province on the northeastern coast of Honduras. Its territory stretched east to Gracias a Dios, south to Olancho and west to the region’s criminal hub, the city of San Pedro Sula.

They also had operators in Nicaragua. Contractors received and moved product from the Mosquito Coast through Gracias a Dios and Colon, where it was broken into smaller and smaller shipments as it made its way across the country.

Allies and Enemies

The Cachiros reportedly supplied cocaine and other drugs to Mexico’s Sinaloa Cartel and had ties to the Colombian criminal organization the Rastrojos.

The group also used gangs to transport some drugs, parceling out the drugs and stuffing them into backpacks to be carried on motorbikes that could more easily avoid military checkpoints by using back roads.

Prospects

With both leaders imprisoned in the United States, the reign of the Cachiros as a major drug transport group is over. However, with the brothers’ cooperating with US authorities, it is possible that testimony they provide could continue to shed light on networks of elites that aided their group’s activities.

In recent years, the testimony of the Rivera Maradiaga brothers have provided a powerful tool against organized crime in Honduras. It has led to a string of connections between Honduras presidents and organized crime, including Manuel Zelaya, Porfirio Lobo and the current president, Juan Orlando Hernández.",described drug traffic

Perence Shiri born Bigboy Samson Chikerema on 11 January 1955 died on the 28th of July 2020

Shiri was a Zimbabwean air officer and government official who served as Minister of Lands, Agriculture and Rural Resettlement in the Cabinet of Zimbabwe from 1 December 2017 until his death in 2020.

He was the commander of the Air Force of Zimbabwe and member of the Joint Operations Command which exerts day-by-day control over Zimbabwe’s government.

Perrance Shiri was a cousin of former President Robert Mugabe, he called himself “Black Jesus” because according to an anonymous claim on BBC Panorama documentary “The Price of Silence”, he “could determine your life like Jesus Christ. He could heal, raise the dead, whatever. So he claimed to be like that because he could say if you live or not.”

On 30 November 2017, Shiri was appointed Minister of Agriculture by President Emmerson Mnangagwa. On 18 December he was promoted from Air Marshall to Air Chief Marshall upon retirement.

Shiri was widely criticized by human-rights organizations for his part in masterminding Zimbabwe’s Gukurahundi massacres. The killings, which took place between 1982 and 1985, left as many as 20,000 dead in the country’s two Matabeleland provinces and the Midlands Province.

At the time, Shiri commanded the North Korean-trained Fifth Brigade, which is accused of mass executions and torture.

Shiri died on 28 July 2020. It is believed that the minister succumbed to COVID-19 and died after having being hospitalised two days earlier.

In 1992, Shiri was appointed as the commander of the Air Force of Zimbabwe, taking over from Air Chief Marshal Josiah Tungamirai.

Shiri was in command of the Zimbabwean troops at the start of the Second Congo War. It was Shiri who decided that the Zimbabwean contingent would defend N’Djili and its airport. This was in order to maintain an air route for resupply and reinforcements if needed.

In the late-1990s and early-2000s, Shiri was reported to have organised farm invasions by war veterans. In 2002, in response to the subsequent food shortage, Mugabe dispatched Shiri to South Africa to purchase maize. This undertaking was backed by a credit note for the equivalent of £17 million from the Libyan leader, Colonel Gaddafi.

Shiri was ambushed on 13 December 2008, while driving to his farm. According to police, he was accosted by unknown people who shot at his car. Thinking one of his tyres had burst he got out and was subsequently shot in the arm. It has been speculated that the assassination attempt may have been a response to Shiri’s attacks on illegal diamond miners in 2008 or because of his role in Matabeleland in the 1980s.

In October 2013, Shiri’s son, Titus Takudzwa Chikerema, died at the age of 21.","contains words 'mass execution' and 'massacres' and he is accused, but he died"

Law enforcement agencies in Boston have charged a Ukrainian national with hacking, credit card trafficking and money laundering conspiracies in a $94 million case.

According to the US Attorney’s Office in the District of Massachusetts, Vitalii Antonenko, 28, (and residing in New York), was indicted on one count of conspiracy to gain unauthorised access to computer networks and to traffic in unauthorised access devices, and one count of money laundering conspiracy.

In March 2019, Antonenko was arrested and detained on money laundering charges at New York’s John F. Kennedy International Airport after he arrived there from Ukraine carrying computers and other digital media that held hundreds of thousands of stolen payment card numbers.

Last year, Antonenko’s lawyers requested a psychiatric evaluation as they said he had difficulty communicating and suggested he is covertly working for the CIA. (Reminds me of the 2002 movie Confessions of a Dangerous Mind.)

In this latest development, he’s only been charged, but depending on the outcome Antonenko could face 20 years in jail and be fined up to $500,000 over the money laundering conspiracy.

As alleged in the indictment, Antonenko and (unnamed) co-conspirators scoured the internet for computer networks with security vulnerabilities that were likely to contain credit and debit card account numbers, expiration dates, and card verification values (payment card data) and other personally identifiable information (PII).

They used a hacking technique known as a “SQL injection attack” to access those networks without authorisation, extracted payment card data and other PII, and transferred it for sale on online criminal marketplaces. Once a co-conspirator sold the data, Antonenko and others used Bitcoin as well as traditional bank and cash transactions to launder the proceeds to disguise their nature, location, source, ownership and control.

US Attorney Andrew E. Lelling and Frederick J. Regan, Special Agent in Charge of the US Secret Service Boston Field Office made the announcement. Assistant US Attorney Seth B. Kosto of Lelling’s Cybercrime Unit is prosecuting the case.

The US Attorney’s Office reminds everyone the details contained in the charging document are allegations. The defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.

Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies often get a bad rap. Why? Usually because of the criminal activities linked to it. There are too many stories to mention, but just this month the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) filed enforcement action in the US against a dastardly Dane for his $1.5 million foreign currency (forex) fraud scheme and registration violations.

Client funds were withdrawn from the US bank accounts by Casper Mikkelsen through his debit card, as well as transferred from the US bank accounts to an overseas bank, and from there to a Bitcoin address for Mikkelsen’s benefit. Mikkelsen then used the money to pay certain clients purported forex trading profits as is typical in a Ponzi scheme.",money laundering

NEW YORK (AP) — The former boss of Honduras’ Los Cachiros cartel testified Friday that he paid hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes to the current and former presidents of Honduras in exchange for protection from extradition to the United States and other favors.

Devis Leonel Rivera Maradiaga said in a Manhattan court that he gave then-President Porfirio Lobo between $500,000 and $600,000 in 2009 and alleged that Lobo helped him launder the proceeds from drug trafficking.

Rivera Maradiaga also said he paid a $250,000 bribe to current President Juan Orlando Hernández, without specifying the date. He said he bribed many Honduran politicians, including the current minister of security.

Lobo has denied wrongdoing, saying last week that he did not receive illicit money from anyone and calling accusations against him “falsehoods from criminals who are trying to reduce their sentence in the USA.”

Juan Orlando Hernández, who is not charged, has similarly called allegations against him lies by “confessed murderers” who want lesser prison sentences and to get revenge against him for his extradition and anti-crime actions.

Rivera Maradiaga’s testimony came on the seventh day of the drug trafficking trial against Tony Hernández, Hernández’s brother.

The former trafficker, who acknowledged being responsible for 78 murders, later said on the witness stand that the leaders of another cartel, los Valle Valle, told him in 2014 that they planned to assassinate Juan Orlando Hernández because he stopped taking their calls after they helped finance his presidential campaign.

Rivera Maradiaga said he had no intention of going along with that plan.

“The FBI revealed the magnitude of the plan by los Valle Valle cartel and its partners to assassinate me, because they knew that sooner or later we were going to capture them, extradite them and seize property obtained through blood,” President Hernández said Friday afternoon on Twitter. “Of that there is real proof; not like the accusations of the narco-assassins.”

Rivera Maradiaga’s testimony adds to a string of corruption and bribery accusations made at the trial.

He is considered one of the most prominent and violent drug traffickers in Honduras’ recent history. He has said that from 2002 to 2013, he smuggled some 130 tons of cocaine to the United States.

In late 2013, he began collaborating with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration.

The following year, he said, he met Tony Hernández at a Denny’s restaurant in the Honduran capital, Tegucigalpa, to discuss getting government money for a shell company that Rivera Maradiaga used to launder drug money. He filmed the encounter with a watch camera and gave it to the DEA, and it was shown in court Friday.

Defense lawyer Michael Tein questioned the witness about the millions he earned from smuggling drugs. Rivera Maradiaga said he made about $50 million and spent it on bribes, jewelry, property, contract killings and gifts to his girlfriends.","bribe, drug trafficking"
TMML2024034002108,Bruce Bagley,"Alert ID: TMML2024034002108
Bruce Bagley knows a lot about money laundering. Too much, federal prosecutors say.

For decades, the University of Miami professor has been the go-to source for journalists looking to understand the shadowy worlds of drug trafficking, organized crime and government graft in Latin America and beyond. But in recent years, authorities say, he became intimately involved with the same corruption that he studied, helping to launder $3 million in dirty money from Venezuela while pocketing about $300,000.

“About the only lesson to be learned from Professor Bagley today is that involving oneself in public corruption, bribery, and embezzlement schemes is going to lead to an indictment,” William F. Sweeney Jr., the head of the FBI’s New York Field Office, said in a statement Monday.

The FBI on Monday arrested Bagley, who co-edited the 2015 book “Drug Trafficking, Organized Crime, and Violence in the Americas Today,” officials said. A statement from the University of Miami said that he had been placed on administrative leave “in light of this development.”

“I’m feeling just fine,” Bagley, 73, told CBS Miami on Monday. “Not guilty. That’s how I’m feeling. They’ve got it all wrong.”

Considered one of the foremost experts in his field, Bagley has served as a consultant to the FBI, State Department, Drug Enforcement Administration and other federal agencies, according to his official biography. He has repeatedly been invited to testify before Congress, served as an expert witness in high-profile trials and lent his expertise on topics including money laundering to the governments of Colombia, Ecuador, Bolivia, Panama and Mexico.

Erick Cruz, a Miami defense attorney who used Bagley as an expert witness in an October cocaine trafficking trial, told the Miami Herald that the professor’s arrest was “pretty shocking.” As an undergraduate at the University of Miami, he had taken Bagley’s class, “Drug Trafficking in the Americas,” he told the paper.

“I remember him telling the class, ‘It’s not a how-to course, it’s a historical review,’ ” Cruz said.

As a professor of international relations, Bagley published dense academic articles with titles such as, “The New Hundred Years War? US National Security and the War on Drugs in Latin America.” In one 2002 paper, he warned that Russian crime syndicates “have been able to offer relatively low-risk money laundering services to a variety of South American drug traffickers, sometimes charging as much as 30 percent of the proceeds.”

He also frequently appeared in the media, popping up in a 1993 story in The Washington Post about cocaine trafficking in Panama as a “University of Miami money laundering specialist.” Reporters from outlets including the New York Times and NPR routinely sought out his thoughts on topics such as the U.S. government’s attempts to fight drug trafficking overseas and the January protests targeting Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. As WLRN reporter Danny Rivero pointed out on Twitter, just hours before news broke of Bagley’s arrest, he was quoted as an expert in a PolitiFact story on the value of the drugs being trafficked over the U.S. border.

In January, Bagley spoke to The Washington Post for a story about Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán Loera, who at the time was on trial in Brooklyn.

“You can’t lop off its head,” Bagley said, referring to the Sinaloa cartel. “The decentralization makes it hard to track down, capture and arrest all of the tentacles, and there’s lots of money flowing through the organization.”

In recent years, prosecutors say, Bagley began using his expertise to funnel money “believed to be derived from graft and corruption in connection with public works projects in Venezuela” into the United States.

State records show that Bagley and his wife incorporated a business called Bagley Consultants Inc. in 2005. The company, referred to as “Company-1” in the indictment, was barely active during its first decade of existence, and, in 2017, the Florida Department of State dissolved it for failing to file an annual report.

But before that happened, federal prosecutors say, Bagley opened a bank account in the company’s name. Then, in November 2017, he began receiving monthly deposits of approximately $200,000 at a time. The money came from a bank account based in the United Arab Emirates, which purportedly belonged to a food company, and another located in Switzerland, which used the name of a wealth management firm based in the UAE.

In reality, authorities say, the money was coming from an unnamed Colombian individual and “represented the proceeds of foreign bribery and embezzlement stolen from the Venezuelan people.” The professor allegedly admitted as much in conversation with another individual, known only as “Individual-1,” who helped him to move the money around.

According to the indictment, Bagley and Individual-1 had a routine. They would go to Bagley’s bank – located in Weston, Fla., the heart of South Florida’s Venezuelan diaspora – and use a cashier’s check to transfer money to Individual-1′s account. Roughly 90 percent of the ill-gotten cash went to Individual-1, and the remainder was wired to Bagley’s personal account.

To hide the true source of the money, Bagley entered into “sham contracts” with the Colombian national, prosecutors said in a Monday statement. Still, the bank shut down his business account around October 2018, citing “suspicious activity.” According to the indictment, Bagley’s response was to open another bank account so that he could continue receiving the cash transfers and taking his cut.

Court records don’t specify what prompted investigators to take a closer look at Bagley’s finances, but, in February, they launched a sting operation to see if he would accept a wire deposit of $224,000. The professor was allegedly informed that the money came from bribes and other corrupt dealings in Venezuela but helped move it anyway, keeping $44,000 for himself.

Although Bagley is based in Florida, the case is being prosecuted by the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York because the money passed through New York City before being deposited in his accounts. He has been charged with two counts of money laundering and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering, and faces a sentence of up to 20 years in prison on each charge if convicted.

“Today’s charges of money laundering and conspiracy should serve as an object lesson for Bruce Bagley, who now faces a potential tenure in federal prison.” Geoffrey S. Berman, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, said in a Monday statement.

Bagley, who was released Monday on $300,000 bond, could not be reached for comment late Monday night. His attorney, Daniel Forman, told the Herald that he plans to “diligently defend” the case in court and fully expects that Bagley will be vindicated.",charged with money laundering

BRASILIA/SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian police raided the home of Agriculture Minister Blairo Maggi on Thursday in a corruption investigation linked to his time as a state governor, adding to the graft scandals rocking President Michel Temer’s government.

Last month the Supreme Court opened a bribery probe into Maggi’s role in a scheme known as “mensalinho,” a payment of a monthly stipend to lawmakers in exchange for political support in his home state of Mato Grosso. He served two terms as governor there between 2003 and 2010.

According to a person with direct knowledge of the matter, the raid was linked to a plea deal by former Mato Grosso state governor Silval Barbosa, who accuses Maggi of participating in the corruption scheme.

Barbosa was Maggi’s vice-governor, replacing him in the top job in 2010 when Maggi resigned to run for a seat in Brazil’s Senate. Barbosa was subsequently elected to a four-year term that ended in 2014.

Maggi denied any wrongdoing, claiming in a statement that Barbosa “lied” in his plea bargain testimony.

“I never authorized any illegal actions while in office nor have I obstructed justice,” Maggi said.

Maggi is a billionaire who was once Brazil’s largest soybean producer. His family firm Amaggi SA runs large farms in Mato Grosso and operates a commodity trading business that competes in Brazil with global firms like Archer Daniels Midland Co, Cargill Inc and Bunge Ltd.

Mato Grosso, where federal police said they served search warrants in nine cities, is a major producer of grains and cattle. Raids were also conducted in São Paulo and Brasília, the police said in a statement.

The probe marks the latest blow to Temer’s administration, whose economic reform agenda has been repeatedly thwarted by graft investigations that have targeted top officials, including the president. Temer has denied any wrongdoing.",corruption suspicion
TMML2024032145113,Zoobia Shahnaz,"Alert ID: TMML2024032145113
— -- A 27-year-old New York City-area woman has been accused of stealing and laundering more than $85,000, using Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, to support ISIS, the U.S. Department of Justice said Thursday.

Zoobia Shahnaz, who lives in Brentwood on Long Island, was charged with bank fraud, conspiracy to commit money laundering and three counts of money laundering. The five-count indictment was unsealed Thursday in federal court in Central Islip, New York.

""The defendant defrauded numerous financial institutions and obtained over $85,000 in illicit proceeds, which she converted to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies,"" the DOJ explained in a statement. ""She then laundered and transferred the funds out of the country to support the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (""ISIS"") ... After consummating the scheme, the defendant attempted to leave the United States and travel to Syria. Shahnaz, a U.S citizen, was arrested yesterday.""

According to court records, Shahnaz worked as a lab technician at a Manhattan hospital until June of this year Around January of 2016, the government says she volunteered in Jordan with the Syrian American Medical Society.

Part of her volunteer work took her to a refugee camp where prosecutors said ""ISIS exercises significant influence.""

But Steve Zissou, an attorney assigned by the judge to represent Shahnaz, told Newsday that she never tried to help ISIS. He said she wanted to help Syrian refugees she met while volunteering.

""Whatever she did was for humanitarian purposes only,"" Zissou said.

Shahnaz is accused of fraudulently obtaining six credit cards and a loan from a Manhattan bank to procure more than $85,000 which prosecutors allege she then converted to Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies and laundered the money through overseas transfers, all with an intent to financially support ISIS. Prosecutors say the financial institutions she defrauded include American Express Bank, Chase Bank, Discover Bank and TD Bank.

Having never told her family she had quit her job in June, she attempted to board a flight at New York City's John F. Kennedy International Airport for Pakistan on July 31, with a layover in Turkey.

She was questioned by law enforcement officials at the airport, since her itinerary was suspect. Prosecutors said they believe she was trying to leave the U.S. for Syria and join ISIS.

""Her itinerary included a multi-day layover in Istanbul, Turkey -- a common point of entry for individuals traveling from Western countries to join ISIS in Syria,"" a court document stated. ""The defendant's return ticket had been booked for September 4, 2017 on a Turkish Airlines flight from Istanbul to JFK.""

But investigators believe Shahnaz had no plans to return to the U.S. She had allegedly done Internet searches for ""one-way tickets to Istanbul"" but purchased a roundtrip ticket. Prosecutors point out that ISIS recommends those wishing to travel to join ISIS to buy roundtrip tickets because they might be deemed less suspicious by law enforcement agents.

Agents said she gave false and conflicting explanations about her overseas wire transfers. She was arrested Wednesday. Prosecutors want her held without bail pending trial.

Her next court date is January 5, 2018.",money laundering charge

Arrest: Mariano Abete is the son of Mafia super-boss Archangel Abete
A baby-faced mafia don thought to be one of Italy's youngest-ever gang bosses has been captured by police in Italy.
Mariano Abete, 21, who is nicknamed 'baby-boss' in the Italian media, was arrested hiding in a secret room concealed behind a remote-controlled wall at his mother's house.
He had been leading the family in a turf war between rival factions of the Neapolitan Camorra which has already claimed dozens of lives.  
Abete had taken the helm after his father was arrested and his uncle murdered, and was wanted by police for mafia association and conspiracy to sell drugs. 
Despite his age, he was said to be powerful and dangerous.
Police swooped on the the house in Naples in the early hours of Saturday before closing in on his hiding place.
But as they began to break through the wall his terrified mother, herself aged only 39, is said to have intervened, begging: 'Please don't hurt him, I'll open it.'
Video of his hiding place, a minute cell hidden between two walls accessible only by a moveable wall operated by remote control, was last night circulating on the web. 
The narrow cavity contained only a mattress, a pillow, a crucifix and a cannister of oxygen.
￼
Abete is considered mafia royalty, being the son of the super-boss Archangel Abete, so-called because he led a splinter group rebellion against the ruling family.
He is also the nephew of another notorious mafia don killed in an ambush in September in a suspected revenge attack for the murder of a notorious mafioso known as  'Wooden Hands'. 
The nickname derived from the fact that he wore prosthetics after losing his hands a decade ago when a home-made bomb exploded.
The hit was the latest murder in the vicious gang war being waged for control of drug trafficking in the Naples districts of Scampia and Secondigliano.",arrest of mafia member

The Anti-Corruption Office (OA). directed by Felix Crous, withdrew the appeal against the dismissal issued in the case against Ricardo Echegaray in February of this year. The state agency, which at first had appealed the dismissal because it was pending the completion of an expert opinion that was pending, now withdrew from its proposal and indicated that The prosecution had also not expressed its opposition to the favorable ruling for the former AFIP head., and therefore, the dismissal was firm.
￼
On February 20 of this year, Judge Rodolfo Canicoba Corral held in a resolution that there were no “concrete elements to question the patrimonial situation” of Ricardo Echegaray, that he had been denounced for illicit enrichment. The magistrate signed the dismissal arguing that, in the absence of delivery of the accounting expertise, There was no evidence to confirm that there was an undue increase in Echegaray’s assets during his time in public administration.
The appeal by the OA – already under Crous’s management – the only complaint in the case, recalled that the expert study ordered during the investigation had not yet been completed, and said that the magistrate had made a “premature” decision because it was necessary to know the detail of that study that they described as “essential”. This work had been commissioned in 2015, a delay that was highlighted by the OA.
For Canicoba Corral, “nothing could be concluded from the totality of the evidence collected, which includes sworn statements, public deeds, bank movements, credit card expenses and insurance policies, added to the number of years of investigation and the search for data through the consumption and expenses perpetrated by Echegaray “.
Based in Chamber I of the Buenos Aires Federal Chamber, the appeal requested that the experts of the Court be summoned to complete the requested expert study and submit the corresponding report. Before this happens, which was to become a reversal of the Canicoba Corral rulingOn July 22, the OA presented a brief in which it mentioned that the prosecution did not appeal the decision of the dismissal.
There, he maintained: “I consider that this Anti-Corruption Office must be, in the current instance that is going through this process, to the action of the constitutional public prosecution exercised by the intervening Federal Criminal and Correctional Prosecutor’s Office, and refrain from recursive activity regarding the interlocutory under analysis. “That is, with the signature of Crous, they gave up appealing.
Consequently, Room I issued a brief resolution to which it agreed Clarion, which maintains: “In response to the statements made by the representatives of the Anti-Corruption Office, the appeal filed must be expressly withdrawn” and this caused the dismissal against Echegaray to be final.
The complaint
Echegaray began to be investigated for alleged illicit enrichment for the period 2004-2009, when he was in front of Customs. The complaint by lawyer Ricardo Mussa maintained that his assets had grown 2,500%.
Mussa denounced that Echegaray upon entering the State in 2004 had an annual salary of 174,608 pesos and at the time of the complaint 364,000. In addition it maintained that during 2008 he would have received two salaries simultaneously in two public administration organizations: ONCCA and AFIP, which would configure a scam. “In her own sworn statement, she admits that she received by the ONCCA entity the amount of 133,322 pesos and by the AFIP 209,360 pesos in parallel, violating the ‘unrestricted respect’ of the Law of Ethics and Suitability in the Public Function.”
There was more. Towards the end of 2015, the assets of the former official K amounted to 7.6 million pesos, as stated before the Anti-Corruption Office. Among his assets was a property in the country Talar del Lago I, an apartment in Punta del Este, another in the Capital. It also counted two boats. At that time, he declared annual income above 6 million pesos.

Honduras’ Foreign Ministry confirmed that the United States government has requested the extradition of Jaime Rosenthal, marking the next step in the US money laundering investigation of one of the country’s wealthiest and most politically influential families.

Foreign Minister Arturo Corrales told La Prensa that his office received the extradition request on December 24. Corrales said he will present the petition before the Supreme Court on January 4.

Rosenthal, a former vice president of Honduras and high ranking official in the Liberal Party, who also oversees the economic conglomerate Grupo Continental, was indicted by the US along with his son Yani, his nephew, Yankel, and a family lawyer last October for money laundering for drug trafficking and corrupt interests.

US authorities arrested Yankel October 6, a day before the indictment was unsealed. Yani reportedly turned himself in a month later.

Rosenthal’s defense lawyer, Marlon Duarte, responded to the recent announcement by saying that Jaime Rosenthal must face criminal charges against him in Honduras before he can be extradited, reported EFE. A Honduran court ordered Rosenthal to be put under house arrest in late November for suspected tax fraud.

InSight Crime Analysis

The extradition request is a clear signal from the United States that it plans on proceeding with the politically sensitive and economically damaging case. The indictment, and a US Treasury “kingpin” designation of the Rosenthal conglomerate that accompanied it, effectively shuttered the family bank and put at risk as many as 11,000 jobs connected to the Rosenthal-owned companies.

When his son Yani — a political heavyweight in his own right — reportedly turned himself over to US authorities, it was seen as a possible attempt to provide legal protection for Jaime. If this was Yani’s intent, it appears his actions weren’t enough to shield his father.

SEE ALSO: Coverage of Elites and Organized Crime

However, it is unclear how soon Honduran authorities will turn over the elder Rosenthal, if at all. As Rosenthal’s defense lawyer correctly pointed out, the business magnate must first resolve any pending charges against him in Honduras before he can be cleared for extradition.

Further complicating the issue is the uncertain outlook of Honduras’ Supreme Court, which is in charge of authorizing extradition requests. Officials are currently in the process of naming new judges to the high court, and the makeup of the bench could have an impact on Rosenthal’s fate.","money laundering, corruption"

The U.S. Department of the Treasury on August 20, 2013 released the following:

“ Designations Include First Sanctions Against a Madrassa Used to Train Taliban Fighters

WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of the Treasury today designated Umar Siddique Kathio Azmarai (Azmarai), a senior Al-Qa’ida official, and Jamia Taleem-Ul-Quran-Wal-Hadith Madrassa, also known as the Ganj Madrassa, a school in Peshawar that serves as a training center and facilitates funding for al-Qa’ida, Lashkar-e Tayyiba, and the Taliban. The activities of the Ganj Madrassa exemplify how terrorist groups, such as al-Qa’ida, Lashkar-e Tayyiba, and the Taliban, subvert seemingly legitimate institutions, such as religious schools, to divert charitable donations meant for education to support violent acts. Today’s action is the first designation of a madrassa that is being abused by terrorist organizations. This action does not generally target madrassas, which often play an essential role in improving literacy and providing humanitarian and developmental aid in many areas of the world, including Pakistan.

“Today’s action strikes at the heart of the financial and logistical support network that abuses charitable donations and provides essential services for various terrorist groups including al-Qa’ida, Lashkar-e Tayyiba, and the Taliban. These networks provide the fighters, training, and supplies for these terrorist groups to carry out their acts of violence against coalition forces and civilians alike,” said Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence David S. Cohen. “We will continue to work with our partners around the world to dismantle these terrorist networks, especially those that try to conceal their sinister activities behind critical community organizations like madrassas.”

During his long tenure with al-Qa’ida, Azmarai has held a number of important positions. He is al-Qa’ida’s leader in Sindh and Balochistan provinces, Pakistan, and has been a significant financial facilitator for the group, moving hundreds of thousands of dollars in support of its leadership and operations. Azmarai has also acted as a courier for al-Qa’ida officials and has managed logistics for family members of senior al-Qa’ida leadership, including Usama bin Laden.

Treasury today also designated the Ganj Madrassa in Peshawar, Pakistan, which is controlled by designated al-Qa’ida facilitator Fazeel-A-Tul Shaykh Abu Mohammed Ameen Al-Peshawari, also known as Shaykh Aminullah. Shaykh Aminullah was designated by both the United States and United Nations (UN) in 2009 for providing material support to al-Qa’ida and the Taliban.

The Ganj Madrassa serves as a terrorist training center where students, under the guise of religious studies, have been radicalized to conduct terrorist and insurgent activities. In some cases, students were trained to become bomb manufacturers and suicide bombers. Shaykh Aminullah has directed donations provided for the school to terrorist groups such as the Taliban, which use the money to fund the ongoing violence in Afghanistan.

The Ganj Madrassa was designated today pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 13224, which targets terrorist and their supporters, for being controlled by Shaykh Aminullah and for providing financial and material support to Lashkar-e Tayyiba and the Taliban. Azmarai was designated pursuant to E.O. 13224 for acting on behalf of al-Qa’ida.

As a result of today’s designation, any assets these entities may have under U.S. jurisdiction are frozen, and U.S. persons are generally prohibited from doing business with them.

Umar Siddique Kathio Azmarai

In addition to his financial activities on behalf of al-Qa’ida, Azmarai has been active in multiple other facilitation duties for al-Qa’ida. As of early 2012, Azmarai facilitated the procurement of secure areas in Pakistan for al-Qa’ida to house militants and store vehicles. Azmarai has frequently acted as a courier within Pakistan for al-Qa’ida leaders and other al-Qa’ida facilitators. As of early 2003, Azmarai was a courier between al-Qa’ida cells in Pakistan and the Persian Gulf and, as of late 2002, was a courier for senior al-Qa’ida operational planner Khalid Shaykh Muhammad.

Azmarai’s facilitation duties on behalf of al-Qa’ida have also included providing logistical support to al-Qa’ida members and their families. As of 2011, Azmarai assisted al-Qa’ida’s administrative manager with managing the care of important al-Qa’ida members’ families, including facilitating their finances, housing, and medical care. In 1999, Azmarai assisted in making logistical arrangements for al-Qa’ida members and their families in Karachi, Pakistan. Azmarai was also specifically responsible for providing support to members of now-deceased al-Qa’ida leader Usama bin Laden’s family. Bin Laden’s son-in-law selected Azmarai in late 1999 to look after bin Laden’s family and, in mid-2000, Azmarai began working directly for bin Laden’s family, facilitating their travel, lodging, and medical needs. From late 2001 through early 2002, Azmarai was responsible for bin Laden’s family members in Karachi. In mid-2002, Azmarai worked for bin Laden’s son, now-deceased Saad bin Laden.

Ganj Madrassa

Under Shaykh Aminullah’s leadership, the Ganj Madrassa has trained and harbored Taliban fighters who have subsequently been dispatched to Afghanistan. As recently as early 2013, Shaykh Aminullah was recruiting for Lashkar-e Tayyiba at the Ganj Madrassa and, as of late 2012, was hosting al-Qa’ida operatives there.

Shaykh Aminullah has provided assistance, including funding and recruits, to al-Qaida. In addition, he directs donations received by the Ganj Madrassa to jihadist fighters battling coalition forces in Afghanistan and also uses the money to train madrassa students to become Taliban fighters. Shaykh Aminullah frequently travels to the Gulf to obtain charity donations on the madrassa’s behalf.

A Harvard graduate and former research associate affiliated with the Kennedy School of Government and the Law School was found guilty of laundering drug money by a Luxembourg court on Thursday.

Jose Franklin Jurado Rodriguez '69-70, a native of Colombia and former resident of Dunster House, was sentenced to four years and six months in prison and ordered to pay a fine of nearly $150,000 by a panel of three judges, The Wall Street Journal reported Friday.

An associate of Jurado's was sentenced to five years in prison and fined $300,000, while a third defendant was acquitted based on insufficient evidence, the Journal reported.

Jurado, who concentrated in economics while at Harvard, was convicted under a 1989 law designed to stem the flow of illegally-earned money into the country's banking system. He and his partners were charged with laundering money on behalf of several cocaine kingpins.

But Jurado's lawyer, contacted by The Crimson yesterday in Brussels, said his client was not managing drug money, and that if he was, Jurado did not know it at the time.

Speaking in French, the lawyer, Jean-Pierre Buyle, said that Jurado was innocent and that the trial was unfair.

""It was a political judgment,"" Buyle said. ""Luxembourg is a small country in financial distress and [the government] is scared to be entangled with drugmoney.""

Calling Jurado ""an exceptional individual,""Buyle said he filed an appeal immediately afterthe verdict was handed down. But the attorney saidhe does not expect the decision to be reversed,adding that he will appeal to the Strasbourg Courton Human Rights, where he said an acquittal ismore likely.

Friends and associates of Jurado in Cambridgeexpressed surprise at the verdict yesterday.

Lecturer in Public Policy Mark A. R. Kleiman,who worked with Jurado for several months in thelate 1980's, said his friend told him that he hadfought against the growing financial influence ofdrug cartels while setting up a stock exchange inColombia in the first half of the decade.

Kleiman, who testified for Jurado before theLuxembourg court, said he thinks that what he sawof the prosecution's evidence was weak and thatthe judges were prejudiced against Jurado.

""Based on the process I saw in Luxembourg, thefact that he was convicted doesn't do very much tochange my belief that he's probably innocent,""said Kleiman, an expert in criminal justice at theKennedy School.

""I had the strong impression that the presidentof the court had already made up her mindthat...the defendants were guilty and regarded thepresence of defense lawyers and defense witnessesas an intrusion into what should have been asimple process of convicting everybody and sendingthem off to prison,"" he added.

Kleiman said he would probably testify again onJurado's behalf if asked to do so by the defense.

""If he was guilty, I'm extremely sorry to hearthat my friend Franklin Jurado took the wrongroad,"" Kleiman said. ""If he's not guilty, I'm evenmore distressed.""

Adi Krause contributed to the reporting ofthis story.

Malaysia has fined 80 individuals and entities, including politicians and businesses, for allegedly receiving money from state fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), the country’s anti-graft chief said on Monday.

The individuals include former Prime Minister Najib Razak’s brother, Nazir Razak, who was chairman of Malaysia’s second-largest bank CIMB until his resignation at the end of 2018.

Former Malaysian trade minister Shahrir Abdul Samad, who was later the chairman of state palm oil agency Felda, and former deputy trade minister Ahmad Maslan were also issued compound notices.

Latheefa Koya, the head of Malaysia’s Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC), told reporters on Monday that the agency was aiming to recover 420 million ringgit ($100m) from individuals and entities who had allegedly received funds laundered through accounts linked to Najib.

Funds had also been distributed to companies, political parties and organisations linked to Najib’s coalition, a list provided by the MACC and sighted by Al Jazeera showed.

This included entities under the previous ruling coalition, Barisan Nasional, and component parties United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), the Malaysian Chinese Association and the Malaysian Indian Congress.

Malaysian and US investigators say about $4.5bn was misappropriated from 1MDB, set up in 2009 by Najib.

“We have issued compound notices against all of these people and entities for the purpose of them to pay up the fine,” Latheefa said, adding that they could be fined up to 2.5 times the amount received.

She said that the largest single sum being asked for was 134 million ringgit ($32m) from an entity.

Individuals who failed to pay their fines could face action against them by the MACC.

Najib, who lost a general election last year, is now facing dozens of corruption and money laundering charges over allegations that he received about $1bn in 1MDB funds. He has pleaded not guilty.

A spokeswoman for Nazir did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Shahrir declined to comment.

In 2015, Nazir went on a leave of absence after the Wall Street Journal reported that he received about $7m from Najib and disbursed the funds to other politicians before elections in 2013.

An independent review into the money transfer concluded that Nazir did not misuse his position and there was no inappropriate use of the CIMB’s resources, following which Nazir resumed his duties as chairman. He resigned last year after almost three decades at the bank.

Nazir had received about 25.7 million ringgit in cheques, Latheefa said. She declined to confirm whether these were the same funds that Nazir had allegedly received in 2013.

After winning last year’s election, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad’s administration has reopened 1MDB probes, charged dozens of high-ranked officials, and filed civil forfeiture actions in a bid to recover money linked to 1MDB.

Since 2016, the US Department of Justice has filed forfeiture lawsuits on about $1.7bn in assets allegedly bought with stolen 1MDB funds, including a private jet, luxury real estate and jewellery.",money laundering

Riduan Isamuddin also transliterated as Riduan Isamudin, Riduan Isomuddin, and Riduan Isomudin, better known by the nom de guerre Hambali, born as Encep Nurjaman (April 4, 1964 [2]) is the former military leader of the Indonesian terrorist organization Jemaah Islamiyah (JI), which is linked with al-Qaeda. He is now in extrajudicial detention in the United States 's Guantanamo Bay detainment camps, in Cuba. [3]

Hambali was often described as ""the Osama bin Laden of Southeast Asia"". Some media reports describe him as bin Laden's lieutenant for Southeast Asian operations. Other reports describe him as an independent peer. He was highly trusted by al-Qaeda and was the main link between the two organisations. Hambali was a close friend of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who planned Operation Bojinka and the September 11 Terrorist Attacks. Hambali envisioned creating a Muslim state, in the form of an Islamic superpower (a theocracy) across Southeast Asia, with himself as its leader (Caliph). His ambition was to rule Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei and parts of the Philippines, Myanmar, and Thailand. [4] [5]

He received increasing attention in the aftermath of the 2002 Bali nightclub bombing, in which 202 people died. [6] He was eventually apprehended in a joint operation by the CIA and Thai police in 2003. He is currently imprisoned in Guantanamo Bay detention camp in Cuba, after three years of CIA custody in a secret location.

Riduan Isamuddin was born Encep Nurjaman in the rice belt of Sukamanah, a small village in Cianjur Regency, in the province of West Java, Indonesia. He was the son of a peasant farmer, and was the second of thirteen children. He first became involved with Jemaah Islamiah as a teenager. He was a diligent student at his Islamic high school, Al-Ianah. He travelled to Afghanistan in 1983 to fight the Soviet Union during the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. During his three years as a mujahid, from 1987 to 1990, he met Osama bin Laden. Friends and family in Indonesia say they did not know of his activities overseas. [7]

His name has been transliterated into English text in several different ways over the years, including;

In 1991, Nurjamin returned to Cianjur for one week, before going to Malaysia, where he met the two co-founders of JI, Abdullah Sungkar and Abubakar Bashir. The three lived in a housing compound in Kampung Sungai Manggis, Banting, Selangor. Nurjaman internationalized the terrorist group's activities and took on a new name in his permanent residence permit: Riduan Isamuddin. His nickname, Hambali, is an allusion to Hanbali, an Islamic school of jurisprudence.

The two co-founders sent their students to ""study"" in Afghanistan and Pakistan. The students actually fought the Soviets until the Soviets pulled out of Afghanistan. A woman named Noralwizah Lee Abdullah had gone to Malaysia for religious schooling. She secretly married Isamuddin after meeting him at the Luqmanul Hakiem School in Ulu Tiram, Johor. The school was founded by Sungkar and Bashir.

Initially, Isamuddin struggled to make a living for his family. He switched from selling kebabs to patenting medicines. He soon disappeared from his home for weeks at a time, and he received many visitors at home. He eventually came to own a red hatchback and several cell phones. Investigators say that many calls on those cell phones were made to Mohammed Jamal Khalifa, Osama bin Laden's brother in law, who had arrived back in Manila, Philippines in 1991.

After Arab visitors gave his family much money, he founded a shell company, Konsojaya, in June 1994. Ostensibly an import-export company trading in palm oil between Malaysia and Afghanistan, it was essentially a front company for terrorism. [ citation needed ] Wali Khan Amin Shah, who would become the financier of Operation Bojinka, was a director of Konsojaya. The company provided financial assistance to the project until it was discovered by investigators on a laptop computer after an apartment fire on January 6, 1995. Shah was arrested in the Philippines but escaped on a short order. Shah was arrested in Malaysia in December 1995. Both Shah and mastermind Ramzi Yousef, who escaped the Philippines but was arrested in Lahore, Pakistan, were extradited to the United States. They were both convicted and sentenced to life in prison for participating in the project.

Hambali goes underground[ edit ]

Hambali's company attracted attention of investigators so his dealings went quiet for a while. [ citation needed ] He decided to preach, raise money, and recruit for his cause. He went underground in 2000 and started a wave of church-bombings in Indonesia. He always had a ""hands-on"" technique; he met his foot soldiers and came to them ""with detailed plans, plenty of cash and two of his own bombmakers."" He always fled before the bombing commenced. Meanwhile, the spiritual leader of Jemaah Islamiah, Abu Bakr Bashir, was preaching jihad at his schools while denying links to Islamic militants. [ citation needed ]

Hambali planned and attended the January 2000 Al Qaeda Summit in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Among the others present were two September 11 hijackers, Khalid al-Mihdhar and Nawaf al-Hazmi. This gathering in Kuala Lumpur was observed by the CIA and Malaysian authorities, but what specifically was being said at the meetings was not picked up. Hambali also provided money and documents to Zacarias Moussaoui in October of that year. However claims by Singaporean security analyst Rohan Gunaratna that he had flown to Australia were dismissed by Australian authorities. [12]

After the Bali nightclub bombing, in which 202 people were killed, Hambali received more attention from the United States. In the years leading up to the attack, the Indonesian government's action against Islamic militants had been minimal. Following the attack, Abu Bakr Bashir was arrested as part of a crack down on Jemaah Islamiah. He was wanted in Indonesia [13] for the bombings of several churches in the region, and wanted for the Bali bombing and a failed plot on several targets in Singapore.

Hambali used a series of safe-houses throughout Southeast Asia, especially Thailand and Cambodia, to move around. While he was in Ayutthaya, Thailand, 75 kilometers north of Bangkok, he was planning a terrorist attack against several Thai hotels and the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit (APEC) in Bangkok in October 2003. Hambali had used a false Spanish passport to enter Thailand while his wife used her Malaysian passport.

Thai police found him as part of a joint operation between the Thai police and the CIA on August 11, 2003. [14] [15] The twenty uniformed and undercover police smashed down the door to his one bedroom apartment in Ayutthaya, and arrested him and 33-year-old Noralwizah Lee Abdullah, a Chinese Malaysian who was considered to be his wife. Hambali was wearing a pair of jeans, a T-shirt, a baseball cap, and a pair of sunglasses. Police also seized explosives and firearms in the property. It marked the end of a 20-month hunt for Hambali, who was 37 years of age when he was captured.

A 2006 Human Rights Watch report stated that Hambali was imprisoned in Jordan for the account of the CIA. [ citation needed ] On September 6, 2006, President George W. Bush confirmed that Hambali had been held by the CIA and revealed that he had been transferred to Guantanamo Bay. [16] His wife is now in Malaysian custody.

On September 8, 2006, Indonesia formally requested access to Hambali to ensure a fair trial. [17] The United States are reluctant to hand him over because of the lenient sentence Indonesia imposed on Bashir. [ citation needed ]

Hambali is also wanted in the Philippines for the transfer of explosives on Filipino soil in an attempt to transport them to Singapore.

Following his capture the USA would not confirm or deny that he was in their custody. But on September 6, 2006, President George W. Bush acknowledged [18] the existence of covert, overseas CIA interrogation centres (colloquially known as black sites) and announced that 14 high-profile members (al Qaeda and other related groups) had been transported from those sites to Guantanamo Bay. [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] Those 14 include Hambali and an alleged lieutenant of his called Mohammed Nazir Bin Lep alias Lillie or Li-Li.

Following his capture, on August 11, 2003, the United States government subjected Hambali to almost three years of isolation, interrogation and torture. [19] [20] [21] [22] Within days of his arrest, he was taken to an undisclosed secret detention facility where he was subject to ""enhanced interrogation techniques"" (EITs) inflicted by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) for approximately three years as part of the notorious Rendition, Detention and Interrogation (RDI) program, which is now commonly known as the ""Torture Program.""

But a complete description of his torture as well as the locations in which it occurred remained classified by the United States government. [19] [20] [21] [22] Only limited amounts of information describing his torture have been released - first from the International Committee of the Red Cross Report on the Treatment of Fourteen 'High-Value Detainees' in CIA Custody dated February 2007 and later by the SSCI Report in 2014. To this day, the United States government continues to conceal Hambali, incommunicado, within a secret prison, Camp 7, for the primary purpose of concealing the crimes of torture committed against him by the Central Intelligence Agency and its subcontractors. The United States government refuses to acknowledge the torture it committed or provide to Hambali's counsel or family information related to his current medical condition and it refuses to provide adequate treatment to him for the effects of the torture committed against him.

According to the 2014 Senate Intelligence Committee report, Hambali was told by an interrogator that he would never go to court: ""We can never let the world know what I have done to you."" [19] [20] [21] [22] [24] And today, this remains the case, as the United States continues to suppress and classify the details of the torture committed as part of the RDI program. From the SSCI Report and the ICRC Report of 2007, the public knows that Hambali was subject to various methods of torture including prolonged periods of hanging.

The torture of Hambali was overseen and supervised, in part, by medical professionals including ethically deviant physicians and psychologists that were procured and funded by the C.I.A.. In both cases, the purpose of providing complicit medical professionals was not to alleviate the effects of this torture but to facilitate the gathering of intelligence. According to the ICRC report, a medical professional who was monitoring Hambali's torture told him, ""I look after your body only because we need you for information."" [25]

the protections of the Geneva Conventions did not extend to captured prisoners who are not members of the regular Afghan armed force nor meet the criteria for prisoner of war for voluntary forces. [26]

Critics argued the Conventions obliged the U.S. to conduct competent tribunals to determine the status of prisoners. Subsequently, the U.S. Department of Defense instituted Combatant Status Review Tribunals (CSRTs), to determine whether detainees met the new definition of an "" enemy combatant"".

""Enemy combatant"" was defined by the U.S. Department of Defense as:

an individual who was part of, or supporting, the Taliban, or al-Qaeda forces, or associated forces that are engaged in hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners. This includes any person who commits a belligerent act or has directly supported hostilities in aid of enemy armed forces. [27]

The CSRTs are not bound by the rules of evidence that would normally apply in civilian court, and the government’s evidence is presumed to be “genuine and accurate.” [28] From July 2004 through March 2005, CSRTs were convened to determine whether each prisoner had been correctly classified as an ""enemy combatant"".

Riduan Isamuddin was among the 60% of prisoners who chose to participate in tribunal hearings. [29] A Summary of Evidence memo was prepared for the tribunal of each detainee, listing the allegations that supported their detention as an ""enemy combatant"".

Riduan Isamuddin's memo accused him of the following: [30]

The Department of Defense announced on August 9, 2007 that all fourteen of the ""high-value detainees"" who had been transferred to Guantanamo from the CIA's black sites, had been officially classified as ""enemy combatants"". [31] Although judges Peter Brownback and Keith J. Allred had ruled two months earlier that only "" illegal enemy combatants"" could face military commissions, the Department of Defense waived the qualifier and said that all fourteen men could now face charges before Guantanamo military commissions. [32] [33]

According to Xinhua, the Department of Justice was considering transferring Riduan Isamuddin to Washington, D.C. for a civilian trial. [34]

Joint Review Task Force[ edit ]

When he assumed office in January 2009, President Barack Obama made a number of promises about the future of Guantanamo. [35] [36] [37] He promised the use of torture would cease at the camp. He promised to institute a new review system. That new review system was composed of officials from six departments, where the OARDEC reviews were conducted entirely by the Department of Defense. When it reported back, a year later, the Joint Review Task Force classified some individuals as too dangerous to be transferred from Guantanamo, even though there was no evidence to justify laying charges against them. On April 9, 2013, that document was made public after a Freedom of Information Act request. [38] Riduan Isamuddin was one of the 71 individuals deemed too innocent to charge, but too dangerous to release. Although Obama promised that those deemed too innocent to charge, but too dangerous to release would start to receive reviews from a Periodic Review Board as less than a quarter of men have received a review.

A PLAYBOY money- laundering suspect once photographed with his arm around Meghan Markle has agreed to hand over almost £10million in assets.

Mansoor Hussain, 40, regularly seen with some of the world’s most famous people, was pursued by Britain’s version of the FBI over alleged links to organised crime lords.

And he was hit with an unexplained wealth order in a legal first.

The party lover was pictured with the Duchess of Sussex at the Global Gift Gala in 2013, three years before she met Harry.

Hussain, from Leeds, was also photographed with music mogul Simon Cowell and shamed tycoon Sir Philip Green on holiday in Barbados in 2012.

And he has been snapped with his arm around pop superstar Beyoncé.

Violent associates are said to include Mohammed Khan — known as Meggy — a notorious criminal from the Leeds area serving a 26-year-old jail sentence for murder.

Hussain owned a property empire but, on the face of it, was a successful businessman with no criminal convictions.

However, the National Crime Agency believed his lavish lifestyle was being funded by money laundering.

And it claimed he used threats of violence and blackmail to buy properties.

The NCA found he had a huge number of bank accounts — one of which had £1million in it.

It could not gather enough evidence over the years for a criminal conviction.

But the £9.8million of assets he agreed to hand over after the unexplained wealth order included 45 properties in London, Cheshire and Leeds, four areas of land, plus cash.

NCA head of civil recovery Andy Lewis said: “By using a civil investigation, we could show by inference that the income, on the balance of probabilities, had come from the criminality of him laundering money for organised crime groups.

“When presented with all of this evidence, we negotiated how we might settle this case without going to a High Court trial.

“Clearly, we can’t be certain of the results and it would save taxpayer money as we could settle early.

“When presented with the evidence, he came to the table and an agreement to hand over just under £10million.

“It’s the first time we have used an unexplained wealth order which has come to fruition.”

It was almost impossible to get evidence such as bank accounts going back 20 years to get a successful criminal outcome.

He added: “He could have lost all of his assets. He’s lost the vast majority.”

Graeme Biggar, NCA director general of the National Economic Crime Centre, commented: “This case is a milestone, demonstrating the power of unexplained wealth orders, with significant implications for how we pursue illicit finance in the UK.”

The former president of an airline at the center of a financial scandal at Newport News-Williamsburg International Airport was sentenced Thursday to two years in prison for fraud in connection with the failure of People Express Airlines in 2014 and the filing of a false income tax return.

Michael Morisi, 59, of Suffolk, is the former president of People Express which engaged in failed start-up operations at the Newport News/Williamsburg International Airport, according to court papers.

He pleaded guilty last July to wire fraud and filing a false federal income tax return.

He faced 23 years on the two charges.

Federal prosecutors said Morisi led the push to get the airline operational, despite a failed track record of getting private investments and significant outstanding liabilities.

A switch to a focus on the public commitment of funds led to PEX obtaining a $5 million loan from TowneBank that was guaranteed by the Peninsula Airport Commission. The loan was funded in June 2014.

Within a month, PEX had drawn down nearly the entire loan amount. PEX operated for approximately three months before suspending service. In the aftermath of the suspension of operations, various creditors sought repayment from PEX in 2014 and 2015, according to a news release from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Virginia.

At the same time, Morisi opened new bank accounts to receive insurance proceeds and avoid the seizure of funds.

Morisi gave false representations to creditors (including the PAC, which paid more than $4 million to satisfy the TowneBank loan) claiming that no funds were available, according to court documents.

He made large purported back salary payments to himself and other executives in lieu of paying creditors, prosecutors said.

When the first bank account was made subject to a state tax lien, Morisi moved accounts again so that he could receive and divert additional insurance proceeds. He also filed false tax returns for three years omitting income and failed to file returns for two additional years, according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office.

In early 2017, a state audit at the airport dug into the matter of the Peninsula Airport Commission using taxpayer dollars to back the $5 million line of credit.

The 2017 audit caused another airline, Elite Airways, to withdraw from a plan to start service to the Newport News airport, citing “challenging perceptions” about the airport.

Former director Ken Spirito was indicted in May on several federal finance charges, according to an Associated Press report. The indictment includes charges of money laundering, and accuses Spirito of hiding public funds that were used to finance People Express Airlines in 2014.",charged for fraud
TMML2024036925137,Diego Montoya,"Alert ID: TMML2024036925137
A reputed drug lord on the FBI's top 10 most-wanted list was captured in western Colombia, the interior minister said Monday, in a major blow to the country's largest remaining drug cartel.

Diego Montoya, who sits alongside Osama Bin Laden as the only major alleged drug trafficker on the FBI list, is accused of leading the Norte del Valle cartel and exporting tons of cocaine to the United States. The FBI had offered a reward of $5 million for information leading to his arrest.

The FBI says Montoya is sought ""in connection with the manufacture and distribution of multiple tons of cocaine."" It said the cartel is aided by left-wing rebels as well as right-wing paramilitaries.

Montoya's brother, Eugenio Montoya Sanchez, was captured by Colombia in January.

The Norte del Valle cartel became Colombia's most powerful after the dismantling of the Medellin and Cali cartels in the 1980s and early 90s. Officials believe it is responsible for as much as 30 percent of the more than 550 tons of Colombian cocaine smuggled each year to the United States.

To protect its valuable drug routes, the cartel is believed to have worked closely with right-wing death squads whose umbrella organization, the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia, is listed as a terrorist organization by Washington.

Authorities have been closing in on the cartel since last year, when the army killed eight members of a private army believed to be protecting Diego Montoya.

A 2006 gunfight outside the Mi Casita psychiatric hospital left 11 Colombian police officers dead, and the police may have been acting on a tip that Montoya was hiding in the home, posing as a patient. There have been charges it was an ambush.

The Christian Science Monitor reports Montoya likes fast cars. Police in 2005 seized his personal mini racetrack last year, along with 74 ranches and eight houses. He is described as heavyset and gruff, and likes to be called ""El Señor de la Guerra (War).""

Since taking office in 2002, President Alvaro Uribe, a key U.S. ally in Latin America, has approved the extradition of nearly 500 Colombians to the United States, the majority on drug-trafficking charges. For his aggressive stance, the United States has awarded Colombia with more than $700 million in annual anti-narcotic aid.

Most of those extradited have been low or midlevel drug traffickers. High-profile extraditions have included Gilberto and Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela, brothers who helped found the Cali cartel.

Colombia is the source of 90 percent of the cocaine entering the United States. Supply has remained robust despite record extraditions and eradication of coca crops.",drug trafficker
TMML2024036010138,Rifaat al-Assad ,"Alert ID: TMML2024036010138
The uncle of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has been sentenced to four years in prison by a Paris court for money-laundering.

Rifaat al-Assad was convicted of embezzling Syrian state funds to buy homes and offices worth €90m (£80m) to build a French property portfolio.

The 82-year-old former vice-president denies any wrongdoing. His lawyers say he will appeal.

His property assets in Paris and London will be seized, the court ruled.

Assad, who was hospitalised with internal bleeding in France in December, was not in court for the ruling and is unlikely to serve his sentence due to his age. His London property is believed to be worth €29m (£26m).

Who is Rifaat al-Assad?

He was once the second most powerful man in Syria - the military commander at the right hand of his brother Hafez, who led Syria from 1971 until his death in 2000.

Rifaat is known as the ""Butcher of Hama"" by some Syrians because of his alleged role in the bloody suppression of an anti-government uprising in the city in 1982 but he has denied any responsibility for the massacre. Between 10,000 and 20,000 people are estimated to have died.

Since 1984, when he led a failed coup against his brother, Rifaat has mostly lived in exile in France and Spain.

After Hafez died in 2000, Rifaat proclaimed himself his brother's legitimate successor. But Bashar became president.

When Syria descended into civil war in 2011 he called on his nephew to step down.

His lawyers say his political past is irrelevant to an investigation into his financial activities.

What is the case about?

Rifaat al-Assad has been under investigation in France since 2014, when the legal NGO Sherpa, which defends victims of alleged economic crimes, filed a complaint saying the value of his property empire far exceeded his known income.

Five years later, the French judicial authorities decided that he should stand trial for crimes allegedly committed between 1984 and 2016, including organised money laundering, aggravated tax fraud and misappropriation of Syrian state funds.

The trial opened on 9 December last year. Assad denied the charges, saying he was given gifts by the Saudi royal family.

His reported French fortune includes two Paris townhouses, a stud farm, a chateau and 7,300 square metres of office space in Lyon. Several luxury properties have already been seized by French authorities.

Assad and his family also have a portfolio of 507 properties in Spain valued at around €695m (£585m).

The properties were seized by the Spanish authorities in 2017 as part of a separate investigation into alleged money-laundering activities by Assad and 13 other people, who have again denied any wrongdoing.

This is the second trial of a member of a foreign ruling family in France on charges of ""ill-gotten gains"".

TMML2024038173142,Grace Mugabe,"Alert ID: TMML2024038173142
Zimbabwean anti-corruption investigators said Monday they are probing whether former First Lady Grace Mugabe fraudulently obtained a doctorate that she apparently received within months and the dissertation for which remains unpublished.

Grace, whose apparent desire to succeed her 93-year-old husband prompted the army takeover that eventually saw Robert Mugabe resign, was awarded a PhD by the University of Zimbabwe in 2014.

Critics argued at the time that Grace, 52, had not actually studied or undertaken research to earn the doctorate and that she had been handed her diploma just months after enrolling. PhDs typically require several years of full-time research and writing.

Her dissertation has never been made public, according to local media, breaking with the established policy of most Zimbabwean public universities to publish doctoral students’ theses.

The state-run Herald newspaper reported in 2014 that Grace’s dissertation was on the theme of “changing social structure (and) the functions of the family” and that she undertook research on Zimbabwean children’s homes.

Grace was personally capped by then-president Mugabe, who was also the chancellor of the University of Zimbabwe, and praised by other government officials who defended the controversial degree award.

“We confirm there is such a report and there is such a probe,” said Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission spokeswoman Phyllis Chikundura who declined to provide further details.

In November 2017, Robert Mugabe fired then-vice president Emmerson Mnangagwa, a move that was seen as opening the way for his wife’s succession. A few days later the military took control of the country, leading to Mugabe’s resignation on November 21.

Mnangagwa was sworn in as president days later and both Robert and Grace have kept a low profile since their spectacular reversal of fortune.

During the height of the upheaval, students at the University of Zimbabwe boycotted their end of term exams to call for Grace to be stripped of her PhD and Robert to be stripped of the presidency.

Grace was routinely accused of extravagant spending on luxury clothes and international travel, and of involvement in corrupt land deals.

Dubbed “Gucci Grace”, “The First Shopper” or even “DisGrace”, she showed her political mettle in 2014 with her ruthless campaign against then Vice President Joice Mujuru, who was then a contender to succeed her husband.

A similar briefing campaign — conducted both publicly and behind the scenes — against Mnangagwa is widely seen as having led to her husband’s downfall.

The U.S. Department of the Treasury today designated drug launderer Pedro Claver Mejia Salazar (Mejia Salazar) and his narcotics money laundering network based in Medellín, Colombia pursuant to the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act (Kingpin Act). Treasury also designated Colombian national Fredy Alonso Mira Perez (alias Fredy Colas), an important underboss in the criminal organization known as La Oficina de Envigado, as well as 10 additional individuals, and 14 entities, all based in Colombia. As a result of today’s actions, all assets that are based in the United States or in control by U.S. persons in which the individuals and entities designated today have an interest in are frozen, and U.S. persons are generally prohibited from engaging in transactions with them.

Mejia Salazar, often acting under the authority and direction of Fredy Colas, primarily launders narcotics proceeds on behalf of La Oficina de Envigado, a group which Treasury designated pursuant to the Kingpin Act on June 26, 2014. As part of his global drug money laundering operations, Mejia Salazar and his network work closely with Lebanese-Colombian drug money launderer Ayman Saied Joumaa, also a Specially Designated Narcotics Trafficker.

“Operatives of La Oficina de Envigado have tapped into Ayman Joumaa’s international networks and successfully moved drug proceeds back to traffickers in Colombia from locations around the world, posing a major threat to U.S. interests,” said Director of Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control Director Adam Szubin. “Treasury will continue to aggressively expose and disrupt the activities of these illicit networks, wherever they may be operating.”

Mejia Salazar relies on a network of trusted family members to carry out his money laundering transactions, including his sons – Juan Carlos, Victor Gabriel, Andres Camilo, and Jose Alejandro Mejia Alzate – and his nephews – Jesus Rodolfo, Jose Albeiro, and Jose Guillermo Barco Mejia. Several entities designated today, which are owned by Mejia Salazar and his family, are also directly involved in these illicit transactions, including Grupo Empresarial Enkor Profesional S.A.S., a well-known beauty products company based in Medellín.

Former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak has been charged with three counts of money laundering linked to a multi-million dollar corruption scandal.

He is accused of having received 42m ringgit ($10m; £8m) from state fund 1MDB in his personal bank account.

Mr Najib was arrested in July and has already been charged with breach of trust and abusing his position.

The new investigation into 1MDB began after his shock election loss in May.

He has always denied any guilt and had been cleared by Malaysian authorities while in power.

Mr Najib, members of his family and several allies are accused of embezzling huge sums allegedly used to buy everything from artwork to high-end real estate around the globe.

The allegations played a central role in his defeat to a reformist alliance led by 93-year old political veteran Mahathir Mohamad.

Raids have been carried out in recent weeks at properties linked to Mr Najib and his wife. Police say the seizure of valuables - including designer handbags, jewellery and cash - was the biggest in Malaysian history.

1MDB, set up by Mr Najib in 2009, was meant to turn the capital, Kuala Lumpur, into a financial hub and boost the economy through strategic investments.

It has been reported that the couple are Leonard Hardy, 54, and Donna Maguire, 57.

They were arrested in Lanzarote.

Five other people were arrested and 11 searches were carried out in the provinces of Las Palmas, Alicante, Malaga and Murcia.

Spanish police said inquiries began following information indicating that money from tobacco and alcohol smuggling was being laundered through the acquisition of properties in different Spanish provinces on the Mediterranean coast and the creation of companies.

They said it involved properties with an estimated value of 10.5m euros.

The investigation has been assisted by Irish police and Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs.

Hardy and Maguire are married with four children and live in Dundalk, County Louth.

Hardy, originally from Belfast, received a six-year sentence in Germany in 2006, after admitting his role in a failed IRA bomb attack on a British Army barracks at Osnabruck in August 1989. He walked free because the offence happened before 1998.

Lamine Diack, the ex-head of athletics' governing body, has been jailed after being found guilty of corruption.

The Senegalese, 87, faced corruption and money-laundering charges linked to the Russian doping scandal.

Diack was convicted of accepting bribes from athletes suspected of doping to cover up test results and letting them continue competing, including in the 2012 London Olympics.

He was sentenced to four years in prison, two of them suspended.

Diack's lawyers said he would be appealing against the judgement, which they called ""unfair and inhumane"".

Diack, who was also given a maximum fine of 500,000 euros (£456,928), was investigated by French authorities for four years over claims he took payments of more than 3m euros to cover up cheating.

The judge said his actions had ""undermined the values of athletics and the fight against doping"".

Diack has been under house arrest in Paris since November 2015.

Previously one of the most influential figures in world sport, Diack was president of the International Association of Athletics' Federations - now World Athletics - for 16 years until he was replaced by Britain's Lord Coe in August 2015.

Diack's son Papa Massata Diack - who was banned for life from athletics in 2016 - was sentenced to five years in prison and a given a 1m euros fine (£913,850).

The National Accountability Bureau (NAB) on Monday filed a corruption reference against former Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz in the accountability court.

The notice from the NAB stated that former federal minister for power and water Liaquat Jatoi, former secretary Ismail Qureshi, additional secretary Yousaf Memon and ex-secretary of Alternative Energy Development Board (AEDB), Dr Naseem A Khan, have also been nominated in the case, as reported by Geo News.

The reference was filed in connection with the alleged illegal appointment of Basharat Hasan Bashir as a consultant for one of the country's top alternative energy board on a Management Position-II (MP-II) scale salary package.

According to the Express Tribune, the ex-joint secretary of water and power, Ghulam Nabi Mangrio, ex-section officer of water and power, Umar Farooq and retired air marshal and former chairman of AEDB, Shahid Hamid, are also among the accused in the NAB reference.

Allegedly, Bashir was appointed as the consultant in 2006 without following prerequisite procedures. His appointment also violated MP scale policy guidelines.

""After the expiry of his consultancy contract in May 2008, the accused Basharat Hasan Bashir illegally held the said post for almost 5 years without any extension, notification or regular appointment and kept on enjoying salary and all perks and privileges illegally in connivance with the management of AEDB,"" the NAB stated in the reference.

The ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) has listed what it described as ‘corruption allegations’ against Senate President, Bukola Saraki.

The list is coming some days after Mr Saraki hinted on his intention to run for president in 2019.

In an interview with Bloomberg, the Senate President said he is ‘actively considering’ running against President Muhammadu Buhari in the 2019 elections.

In a statement signed by its National Publicity Secretary, Yekini Nabena on Monday, the APC raised alarm against the use of stolen public funds to finance elections in Nigeria.

“Against the backdrop of the litany of corruption allegations trailing the Senate President, Saraki’s declaration, brings to the fore our earlier call to anti-graft agencies to check the use of stolen public funds to finance elections in this country. We reiterate our position that the Nigerian electorate must have the opportunity to choose from candidates that can pass the integrity and anti-corruption test.”

The party then went on to list corruption cases against Mr Saraki.

“Let us refresh our memory on some of Saraki’s corruption allegations:

“Allegations of fraud which led to the collapse of the Saraki family-owned Société Générale Bank (Saraki who was Director of the defunct bank was indicted over N1 billion alleged to have been looted from the bank’s treasury).

“Misappropriation of Kwara State funds, disregard of government due process and conversion of State government assets into his and cronies when he served as two-term governor of Kwara State.

“History of betrayals, treachery and sabotage – family, political party (PDP, APC), Senate, government.vSaraki was questioned by the Nigeria Police Special Fraud Unit over a N11 billion financial scandal at the defunct Intercontinental Bank.

“Gluttonous property acquisitions and hidden multi-billion dollar assets spread across the world as disclosed by the Panama Papers revelations. The multi-million dollar white elephant Shonga Agricultural Project in Kwara State when Saraki served as two-term governor.

“Falsification of Senate standing order. Saraki’s link to the N298m armoured Range Rover SUV seized by the Nigeria Customs Service. Saraki’s link to $19.5 billion Paris Club Loan refund scandal. Oversaw budget padding in the National Assembly among other numerous corruption scandals.”

The APC accused Mr Saraki of being selfish in his political ambition and leadership of the National Assembly.

“Nigerians should be wary of a man whose personal ambition will always supersede the interest of the majority and national interest as currently displayed in the National Assembly. While Saraki refuses to reconvene the National Assembly, the 2019 election budget of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) is dangerously delayed, an action deliberately taken to sabotage INEC’s ability to conduct free, fair, transparent and credible elections in 2019.

“While Saraki refuses to step down as Senate President as rightly and severally demanded by the APC-dominated Senate, he is bent on foisting a PDP-minority rule (Senate President and Deputy Senate President) in the Upper Legislative House.

“The only politics that Bukola Saraki plays is self, himself only and only himself. The interest and welfare of the people of Nigeria do not mean anything to him. Now it is the Presidency Saraki wants. And we ask with what antecedents is he doing this? Conspiracy, blackmail, treachery and vaulting ambition which overleaps itself and falls on the other, as rightly captured by William Shakespeare. Bukola Saraki will rather rule in hell than serve in paradise.

“Ahead of 2019 elections, Nigerians must ensure that we never again entrust the leadership of this great country to thieves whose sole aim is treasury looting and returning us to the dark ages where impunity and institutionalised corruption was the order of the day.”

Since announcing his defection to the PDP, the APC has insisted Mr Saraki must resign since his party ”does not enjoy a majority in the Senate”.

The chairman of the party, Adams Oshiomole, had attacked Mr Saraki, insisting he (Saraki) relinquish his position.",corruption

Five fraudsters who offered a ‘green' tax efficient investment scheme to wealthy investors in order to steal millions from them have been ordered to pay £20,611,738.

The Oxbridge alumni used their former positions as a conductor of the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra, a solicitor and merchant banker to persuade wealthy investors to put money into their ‘green’ investment scheme.

Investors were told their money would be spent on research and development into carbon credits, but only £16 million of the £65 million was actually spent on planting trees.

Instead the group stole £20 million of the investors’ money and laundered it via bank accounts and secret trusts, spending it on luxury properties in London, Australia and Dubai as well as hidden off-shore investments. They also failed to pay around £6.5million in tax.

On Friday 13 December at the Old Bailey, Michael Richards, Rodney Whiston-Dew and Evdoros Demetriou have been ordered to pay £17.7 million collectively and if they fail to return the funds in the next three months, they face further time in jail. At an earlier hearing Robert Gold and Jonathan Anwyl were ordered to repay £2.64 million and £253,934 respectively.

Manjula Nayee of the CPS said: “These men used their elite background to persuade people to part with their money, resulting in a huge loss to the victims and the public purse.

“Seizing these assets shows that we will do everything we can to ensure that criminals do not profit by exploiting others.”

The criminal benefit
To determine how much these men had profited from their scam ‘green’ scheme, the prosecution had to consider issues around ownership of different properties, international trusts, the corporate veil, tainted gifts as well as the effect of inflation, given the offences happened over 12 years ago.

They had laundered the proceeds internationally, hiding funds in accounts across China, the British Virgin Islands, Greece and Switzerland, which all had to be taken into consideration as part of the confiscation proceedings.

The vast amount of evidence gathered to support the case for their benefit amounts resulted in an opening argument of more than 100 pages for a heavily contested hearing which lasted two weeks.

The defence presented materials to show that each money launderer had little in the way of available assets, but the CPS was able to show these claims were false by identifying £20,611,738 of available assets.

Manjula Nayee continued: “It is thanks to the dedication of every member of the prosecution team that worked on this case that, we could be confident the defendants had nowhere to hide. Now they must pay the millions they owe or face further time in jail.”

TMML2024031736160,Timothy Despain,"Alert ID: TMML2024031736160
Assistant Attorney General Christopher A. Wray of the Criminal Division, Enron Task Force Director Andrew Weissmann, and Assistant Director Chris Swecker of the FBI announced today that Timothy Despain, the former assistant treasurer of Enron Corp., has pleaded guilty to a charge of conspiracy to commit securities fraud.

Despain, 39, of Houston, Texas, entered the guilty plea today before Judge Ewing Werlein at U.S. District Court in Houston. As part of his plea, Despain has agreed to cooperate fully and truthfully with the Enron Task Force's ongoing criminal investigation into the collapse of Enron. Despain pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud, and faces a maximum sentence of five years in prison and a fine of $250,000 or twice the loss.

The information and plea documents signed by Despain state that Despain was an Assistant Treasurer of Enron from approximately January 1999 until May 2002. Despain was responsible for coordinating interactions between Enron senior management and the national credit rating agencies who rated Enron's corporate debt. Despain admitted that from 1999 through the fall of 2001, he and his superiors engaged in conduct that he knew was intended to fraudulently manipulate Enron's credit rating. Despain admitted that he knew this rating was relied on by the holders and prospective purchasers of Enron's publicly traded stocks and bonds. Despain stated that during this time period he was supervised directly by the people who served as Enron's treasurers—including Ben Glisan, who pleaded guilty in September 2003 and is currently serving a five-year prison sentence.

Despain admitted that in communicating with representatives of the rating agencies, he and others at Enron did not truthfully present the financial position and cash and funds flow of the company—key factors influencing the company's rating. Among other things, Despain admitted that he and others falsely represented to credit rating agencies that Enron's cash flows from its non-regulated businesses were stable and predictable. In fact, the annual cash flow targets that Enron set for itself and reported to the rating agencies were arbitrarily based on what he and others believed was necessary to maintain Enron's investment-grade credit rating, rather than on the amount of cash flow Enron's non-regulated businesses were expected to achieve.

One example of such an improper transaction was ""Project Nahanni."" Despain admitted that, in late 1999, Enron was at least $500 million short of the cash flow target it had artificially set and then told the national rating agencies it intended to achieve for 1999. In order to make up this shortfall, Enron entered into Project Nahanni, a transaction that resulted in Enron reporting the sale of $485 million of Treasury securities as cash flow from operations. Despain admitted that he and others knew that there was no business purpose to the Project Nahanni transaction, other than to achieve Enron's desired cash flow results. Moreover, the sale of Treasury securities should not have been characterized as a sale of a merchant asset and therefore should not have been included in the cash flow from operations figures presented to the rating agencies. This transaction occurred during a time in which Enron was actively pursuing a credit rating upgrade from one of the national credit rating agencies. Despain stated that he knew at the time of the Project Nahanni transaction that if the rating agencies understood that $485 million of the reported cash flow from operations for 1999 was from the sale of Treasury securities, Enron's credit rating would have been negatively affected, and Enron would not likely have received the desired upgrade in its credit rating.

Despain also admitted that another mechanism by which Enron achieved the artificial cash flow targets it set for itself was through transactions commonly referred to within the company as ""prepays."" The reporting of the cash received from these transactions was a means of demonstrating to the rating agencies Enron's ability to recognize cash from its mark-to-market trading book. Although the prepay transactions were accounted for as commodity transactions and reflected on Enron's books as a trading liability, the transactions in substance created debt-like obligations to the financial institutions that advanced funds to Enron through the transactions. Despain and others told the rating agencies that the cash generated from Enron's trading operations was from the sale or ""monetization"" of trading contracts or the future cash flow streams from those contracts.

The agencies were led to believe that Enron was generating cash by selling an asset, when in fact Enron was generating cash by incurring a future obligation that operated as debt. Over the course of Despain's time as Assistant Treasurer, Enron's obligations under the ""prepay"" transactions grew to approximately $5 billion. Despain stated that he was directed by Enron's treasurers not to reveal to, or discuss with the credit rating agencies the nature and extent of the prepay transactions entered into by Enron.

Despain and the treasurers recognized that if the rating agencies knew about the nature and extent of Enron's prepay transactions, such information would have had a materially negative effect on Enron's credit rating.

Enron, at one time the seventh-ranked company in the United States with stock trading as high as $80 per share in August 1999, filed for bankruptcy protection on December 2, 2001 and its stock became virtually worthless.

The investigation into Enron's collapse is being conducted by the Enron Task Force, a team of federal prosecutors within the Justice Department's Criminal Division and agents from the FBI and the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigations Division. The Enron Task Force also has coordinated with and received considerable assistance from the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Enron Task Force is part of the President's Corporate Fraud Task Force, created in July 2002 to investigate allegations of fraud and corruption at U.S. corporations.

To date, 33 defendants have been charged in connection with the work of the Enron Task Force, including 24 former Enron executives. With the plea today, 16 defendants have so far been convicted. The Enron Task Force has obtained more than $162 million in forfeiture for restitution to victims.",conspiracy to commit securities fraud

PARIS —

The Bosnian Serb general who led the 1992-95 siege of Sarajevo, a modern-day European agony in which more than 10,000 civilians lost their lives to snipers or wanton artillery shelling, was arrested on war crimes charges Monday by NATO-led peacekeepers.

A witness told journalists in Bosnia-Herzegovina that Stanislav Galic, 56, was detained after a jeep driven by peacekeepers cut off the car he was riding in in the northwestern city of Banja Luka.

Soldiers of the NATO-led Stabilization Force then reportedly smashed the car window, opened the door and forced Galic out. He was made to lie on the ground, his hands were cuffed, and he was bundled away by the peacekeepers, said the witness, who spoke on condition that he not be identified.

Galic was expected to be in The Hague within 48 hours for arraignment before the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, officials there said. His arrest was a major development in the search for justice in Bosnia, where the siege of the capital--the first in Europe since World War II--came to epitomize the suffering of ordinary people in the Balkan republic, the callous ruthlessness of ethnic Serbian forces and the inability of the outside world for a long time to do much about either.

“For 44 months, the Sarajevo Romanija Corps [commanded by Galic in 1992-94] implemented a military strategy which used shelling and sniping to kill, maim, wound and terrorize the civilian inhabitants of Sarajevo,” prosecutors at the U.N. tribunal in The Hague said in a statement after Galic’s arrest.

Under Galic, the prosecutors charged, Bosnian Serb troops in the hills overlooking the city “directed shelling and sniping at civilians who were tending vegetable plots, queuing for bread, collecting water, attending funerals, shopping in markets, riding on trams, gathering wood, or simply walking with their children or friends.”

According to Bosnia’s Muslim authorities, 10,500 people, among them 1,650 children, perished during the siege, and more than 58,000 were wounded.

“The attacks on Sarajevo civilians were often unrelated to military actions and were designed to keep the inhabitants in a constant state of terror,” prosecutors in The Hague said.

Galic was in command of the Romanija Corps when one of the most infamous incidents of the mostly Muslim city’s ordeal occurred: the Feb. 5, 1994, shelling of the Markale outdoor market, in which 68 people were killed and more than 200 were wounded, some horribly.

The marketplace carnage, heavily publicized by foreign television crews and print reporters, moved the outside world to action. The U.N. Security Council threatened the Bosnian Serbs with airstrikes. Four days after the market shelling, the Bosnian Serbs accepted a cease-fire that was to last several months and agreed to pull back their heavy artillery about 12 miles from Sarajevo.

Galic retired from his command two months later. He became military advisor to Nikola Poplasen when the latter was elected to the presidency of Bosnia’s Serb Republic in September 1998.

In a secret indictment issued March 26 and sealed until Monday, Galic is charged with three violations of the laws and customs of war and four acts of crimes against humanity. He is the third senior Bosnian Serb commander arrested for alleged crimes during Bosnia’s 1992-95 civil war. Already in custody in The Hague are Radislav Krstic, charged with genocide in the massacre of thousands of Muslims in Srebrenica in 1995, and Momir Talic, accused of leading a blood bath against Croats and Muslims in northwestern Bosnia in 1992.

“This latest arrest of a retired major general in the Bosnian Serb army is in line with my policy of targeting senior figures in the chain of command for crimes committed during periods of armed conflict,” said Carla del Ponte, chief prosecutor at the U.N. court.

Her spokesman, Paul Risley, said the only two senior figures of the wartime Bosnian Serb leadership who remain at large are the Bosnian Serbs’ then-president, Radovan Karadzic, and his military chief, Ratko Mladic.

This year, Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and a number of high-ranking members of the Serbian leadership were indicted for alleged crimes in Kosovo, a province of Serbia, Yugoslavia’s dominant republic. They are still in Yugoslavia.

The leadership of Bosnia’s Serb Republic vigorously protested Monday’s arrest, saying it jeopardized its attempts to cooperate with the war crimes tribunal.

Officials in The Hague and at North Atlantic Treaty Organization headquarters in Brussels refused to divulge the nationality of the soldiers who grabbed Galic, apparently out of fear of reprisals by Bosnian Serbs. Banja Luka is headquarters of the British-controlled sector of the Balkan republic, and its garrison of troops from the NATO-led Stabilization Force is largely British.",

A serial fraudster who posed as a solicitor and pretended to represent ‘extremely vulnerable’ women in court cases has been jailed for four years and handed a ten-year restraining order.

Stephen Davey, 49, pleaded guilty to two counts of fraud by false representation, making articles to use in fraud, possessing articles to use in fraud and theft. He was sentenced at Liverpool Crown Court.

According to a statement by Cheshire Constabulary, Davey put two women in touch with a 'solicitor', who offered to represent them in family court cases at a discount price. The solicitor did not in fact exist and money went into Davey’s bank account.

All dealings with the ‘solicitor’ were done via email and Davey made excuses when he was due to meet the women. According to the police statement, Davey told the women that their court cases were going well and emailed them various legal documents to back up his claims.

At one point, Davey told a mother that she had won full custody of her children and had been awarded £65,000.

As a result of Davey’s deception, the women were not represented in court and both their cases were put in ‘severe jeopardy’.

According to the police statement, Davey also posed as a police officer and a probation worker, and convinced a woman he was in love with her in order to extort money. The court heard that Davey extorted more than £7,000 in total from his victims.

Detective Constable Laura Gilbert of Warrington CID said: ‘Stephen Davey is a manipulative and despicable individual who has knowingly preyed on extremely vulnerable victims. His offending showed significant premeditation and he attempted to cover his tracks at every turn.’",fraud and theft

Quoting from a 52-page court document from Abramovich's battle with old mentor and fellow oligarch Boris Berezovsky, The Times claims that the billionaire paid older oligarchs so he could by their shares in Russia's oil and aluminium assets and emerge from the break-up of the Soviet Union with a vast fortune.

These 'aluminium wars' that led to gangland violence that claimed over 100 lives, but as a result, Abramovich is now worth an estimated £11.4 billion.

Abramovich is being sued at London Commercial Court, with 62-year-old Berezovsky claiming he was forced to sell his shares in Sibneft, Rusal and ORT - oil, aluminium and TV companies respective - at bargain prices, from which Abramovich has now profited.

The court papers state that the Chelsea owner has accused Berezovsky, as well as the late Badri Patarkatsishvili or Georgia, of demanding money to help him emerge from obscurity.

""Prior to the August 1995 decree, the defendant informed Mr Berezovsky that he wished to acquire a controlling interest in Sibneft on its creation,"" stated the defence papers.

""In return for the defendant agreeing to provide Mr Berezovsky with funds he required in connection with the cash flow of ORT, Mr Berezovsky agreed he would use his personal and political influence to support the project and assist in the passage of the necessary legislative steps leading to the creation of Sibneft.""

Abramovich paid $500 million to Patarkatsishvili to protect him from the aluminium wars and the Chelsea chief has admitted he owes his success to the Georgian.

The papers read: ""Mr Patarkatsishvili did ... provide assistance to the defendant in the defendant's acquisition of assets in the Russian aluminium industry.""

The Times reports that Patarkatsishvili, who died aged 52 from a heart disease, was an infamous middle-man with organised crime. The court papers contend that the diseased confronted Abramovich at a Swiss airport, demanding he pay $1.3 billion to Berezovsky.

""The defendant agreed to pay this amount on the basis that it would be the final request for payment by Mr Berezovsky and that he and Mr Patarkatsishvili would cease to associate themselves publicly with him and his business interests,"" they read.

John Mann, a spokesman for Abramovich and Millhouse Capital, told AFP: ""It is an ongoing matter. While the case is ongoing, we won't be making any comments on it.""

Berezovsky has confirmed that the paper's account of the court documents was accurate, but would not confirm if the court documents themselves were accurate. ""It's not my job, it's the job of my lawyers.""",corruption
TMML2024036245170,Jean Chrétien,"Alert ID: TMML2024036245170
Canadian Prime Minister Paul Martin and Jean Chrétien, his predecessor as head of the Liberal government, testified under oath last week at a public inquiry investigating alleged government corruption. Only once previously did a sitting or past Canadian prime minister give public testimony in a like judicial proceeding. That was in 1873, when Canada’s first prime minister, Sir John A. Macdonald, responded to charges his government had awarded a railway contract in return for massive election campaign contributions to his Conservative Party.

At Martin’s request, Justice John Gomery is investigating a federal government program under which Ottawa paid out $250 million between 1996 and 2002 to sponsor sporting and cultural events. Much of the money was funnelled through Liberal-friendly advertising firms. It is not uncommon for Canadian governments, whether federal or provincial, to steer government advertising and consultancy work to firms known to be friendly to the party in power. But in this case, internal government audits found the program improperly managed, with financial records either nonexistent or replete with errors and gaps.

A government study of contracts given to Le Groupe Polygone Editeurs, which received $40 million in sponsorship money, said that there appeared to have been “systematic and egregious overcharging for what was delivered.” A subsequent investigation by Canada’s auditor-general found repeated instances of Groupe Polygone and other firms receiving large payments in return for little or no work. Criminal charges have been laid against several advertising company executives.

There is little doubt some people criminally profited from the sponsorship program. There are also good grounds to believe that the program—whose ostensible purpose was to raise the profile of the federal government in Quebec and thereby counter the Quebec indépendantiste movement—was used to finance the Quebec wing of the Liberal Party. According to Alfonso Gagliano, who for much of this period was both the minister responsible for the sponsorship program and the boss of the Quebec Liberal machine, the Liberal Party was “not rich.” It, however, did receive substantial donations from many of the firms and executives of the firms that received sponsorship contracts from Gagliano’s Public Works Ministry or to which sponsorship work was subcontracted.

That said, the sponsorship scandal—the blaring headlines and feigned outrage of opposition politicians notwithstanding—is pretty much small potatoes. As the doyen of Canadian political journalism Peter C. Newman conceded, patronage has always been integral to the functioning of Canada’s major political parties. “Patronage,” wrote Newman in a recent op-ed piece, “is the udder of Canadian democracy. It has fuelled Canadian politics since Sir John A. Macdonald, our Founding Father, accepted bribes from would-be builders of the CPR.”

The enormous amount of air-time and ink the corporate media have devoted to the sponsorship scandal and the place it has taken in the official political debate stand in sharp contrast to the treatment accorded other cases of political corruption. Take, for example, the millions of dollars in questionable contracts that high-level operatives in the Ontario Tory government and Ontario Conservative Party were given by the province’s Crown-owned hydro companies between 1995 and 2003. As in the sponsorship scandal, many of the contracts called for little if any real work. Yet the press soon dropped the story.

And what of the revelation that Karlheinz Schreiber, a German-Canadian arms dealer whom the German government is seeking to extradite, paid former Progressive Conservative Prime Minister Brian Mulroney $300,000—in cash, in hotel rooms—shortly after he left office? Although Mulroney’s explanation—that the money was in return for the advice he gave Schreiber on a pasta-manufacturing scheme—is, to say the least, implausible, few newspapers reported on Schreiber’s payments to Mulroney. None has pursued the story.

If the sponsorship scandal has become such a major political issue, it is because it has served as a mechanism through which Canada’s corporate and political elite have fought out matters of leadership and policy direction.

The neo-conservative National Post and the official opposition Canadian Alliance—now merged with the Tories in the new Conservative Party—have long-trumpeted allegations of waste and corruption in government spending. They have done so in order to discredit their Liberal rivals and, more generally, with the aim of depicting government spending as out of control, so as to bolster their crusade for tax cuts and for “getting government off the back of Canadians” through privatization and deregulation. In this they have been inspired, if not directly advised, by the US Republicans who used a trumped-up financial scandal, Whitewater, and then the Monica Lewinsky affair to destabilize the Clinton administration and ultimately to try to unseat Clinton.

Paul Martin and his supporters in the Liberal Party and sections of the ruling class who still view the Liberals as the party best able to govern in their interests—because of residual popular illusions in the Liberals’ being a party of the “people” and because of the Liberals’ commitment to a strong federal state—also made use of the sponsorship scandal and other allegations of impropriety in pushing for Chrétien to retire.

And since the release of the auditor-general’s damning report on the sponsorship program last February, Martin and the Conservatives, to say nothing of the pro-independence Bloc Québécois, have all found it in their interest at various times to focus public attention on the sponsorship scandal, so as to avoid discussion of their own records, programs and intentions.

This choice of means is, of course, not without significance. There is great popular dissatisfaction with, and disaffection from, all the establishment parties, from the avowedly pro-big business Conservatives through the social democrats of the New Democratic Party, because they have all been party to the assault on public and social services and trade union and democratic rights. Because there is no popular constituency for big business’s program of razing what remains of the welfare state, gutting all regulatory restraints on capital, and bringing Canada into a closer economic and geo-political partnership with Wall Street and Washington, big business and its political representatives have increasingly resorted to the politics of scandal and subterfuge and to nationalist and other noxious appeals in moulding and manipulating public opinion.

From Chrétien to Martin

Jean Chrétien, in a lengthy opening statement before Justice Gomery’s inquiry, made an impassioned defence of his government’s record, arguing explicitly that his government had strengthened Canada and implicitly that he had well served the interests of Canadian big business. The Wall Street Journal, he observed, had warned shortly after he came to office that Canada was being reduced to the status of a Third World country. But his government had taken decisive action to put federal finances in order. Boasted Chrétien, “We had 10 great years when we turned it around, we took deficit to surplus, we paid the national debt.”

Indeed, in terms of socioeconomic and fiscal policy, the Chrétien Liberal government was far and away the most right-wing federal government since the Great Depression. It slashed tens of billions from health care and other public services, rewrote the rules governing Canada’s unemployment insurance program to deny benefits to the majority of the jobless, and, once the annual budget deficit was eliminated, announced a five-year, $100 billion program of corporate and personal income tax cuts skewed to benefit the rich and designed to ensure that the state lacked the resources to reinvest in public services.

Nevertheless, big business became increasingly dissatisfied with Chrétien, especially after the coming to power of the Bush administration in 2001. Chrétien’s Trudeau-era Canadian nationalism, with its streak of anti-Americanism, his reluctance to give a massive, multibillion-dollar permanent boost to the military budget, and his failure to publicly promote privatization and deregulation, were all seen as inimical to big business’s interests.

Under conditions where the bourgeoisie’s traditional alternate party of government, the Progressive Conservatives, had been reduced to a rump, the most powerful sections of Canadian business fixed on Martin—himself a multimillionaire businessman and Chrétien’s finance minister—as the best means of unseating Chrétien and shifting the government further right.

Martin was thus egged on in his campaign to seize the leadership of the Liberal Party and prime ministership, the first time a sitting prime minister was felled from within his own party. Although Martin did not directly raise the sponsorship issue during his campaign for the prime ministership, he certainly benefited by press suggestions that financial improprieties had taken place under Chrétien’s watch and alluded to the scandal with his promises of doing politics differently.

What brought the sponsorship scandal to centre-stage was Martin’s decision to fan public outrage over the auditor-general’s report castigating the program. Rather than downplaying the report’s significance, Martin declared himself mad as hell. He hailed the report’s author, Sheila Fraser, as a national hero, asserted that there must have been “political direction” behind the failure to follow normal government procedures in the awarding and administering of contracts, fired Gagliano from his post as Canada’s ambassador to Denmark, and sacked several long-time Liberals from their posts as heads of various Crown Corporations.

Invariably newspaper columnists have presented Martin’s response to the auditor-general’s report as a settling of accounts with Chrétien and his faction of the Liberal Party. Undoubtedly, personal rivalries and power struggles were involved. But Martin’s decision to champion the sponsorship scandal was also rooted in his anxiousness to demonstrate to big business that his government was a new regime, not a continuation of the Chrétien Liberal government.

Martin’s first actions on taking office all signalled a shift to the right. He announced an immediate review of all government spending and a freeze on recently announced expenditures. He stressed his intention to mend fences with the Bush administration and, after an initial get-acquainted meeting with Bush, declared that any differences between the US and Canadian governments over the Iraq war were now history.

The need to seek a popular mandate constrained Martin, however, from fully satisfying business’s demand for a sharp shift to the right, especially in the form of a new round of tax cuts, the gutting of Canada’s Kyoto Accord commitments, and a closer partnership with the US. He and his aides decided instead to amplify the sponsorship scandal, so as to demonstrate, pending a spring election, that a new team with different ideas was in power.

The ruse failed. Martin apparently believed the media hype about his being Canada’s most popular political leader and his unique bond with Canadians. But his trumpeting of the sponsorship scandal sent Liberal polling numbers into freefall.

The Conservatives and Bloc Québécois, meanwhile, fastened onto the sponsorship scandal. Both parties made the purported fight against corruption in government the centrepiece of their campaigns for the June 30 federal election. For the Conservatives, the denunciations of Liberal corruption served as means of deflecting popular attention from their right-wing program and party leader Stephen Harper’s record as a neo-conservative ideologue.

The election left the Liberals clinging to power, more than 20 seats short of a majority of in the House of Commons. Moreover, Martin’s room for maneuver was further reduced by the large increase in votes for parties that portray themselves as left-wing opponents of the two major parties, the New Democratic Party, Bloc Québécois and Greens.

Chrétien and Martin before the commission

Chrétien was the first of the two Liberal Party leaders to appear before the Gomery Commission. He ceded nothing to his critics, insisting that the sponsorship program had been an essential part of the federal government’s strategy to fight Quebec separatism, and made his disdain for the commission clear to all.

Earlier Chrétien’s lawyers had pressed for Judge Gomery to step down as inquiry head, arguing that comments Gomery made to the press in December that were critical of Chrétien showed that he had prejudged the case and that his appointment of Bernard Roy, one of the closest associates of Brian Mulroney, as the commission’s lead lawyer indicated bias. (Roy was best man at Mulroney’s wedding, later served as his chief of staff, and currently works for the same law firm as Mulroney.)

Chrétien concluded his testimony with a farcical piece of courtroom drama meant to underline his contempt for the proceedings. He answered Gomery’s quip that the government’s purchase of golf balls with his signature imprinted on them was “small-town cheap” by pulling from his pocket golf balls he had received from Presidents Bush and Clinton bearing their imprinted signatures, as well as one produced for the law firm at which Mulroney and Bernard Roy now work.

While Chrétien and the commission had their daggers drawn, Justice Gomery and the commission’s lawyers gave Martin every opportunity to get out his message that he knew nothing of the details of the sponsorship program, because he was preoccupied with his duties as finance minister, and because Chrétien and his aides made sure that he had no role in managing the Quebec Liberal machine. Observing that it was “rather rare” for a prime minister to testify before a public inquiry, government lawyer Sylvain Lussier concluded his questioning of Martin by asking, “Is this an indication of how seriously you take the commission?”

The press reaction to Chrétien’s and Martin’s testimony is more significant than the scripted lines they delivered during their respective appearances. While many newspaper columnists and editorial writers insisted that Chrétien has much to answer for, there was a grudging admiration for his grit and political smarts.

The press was all but unanimous that Martin should be taken at his word. But even as it exonerated the prime minister of all blame for the sponsorship program, the press chastised him for his earnest, long-winded answers and tied this to sharp criticisms of his failure to “show leadership.” By this, they mean his reluctance to court unpopularity by taking decisions, like signing Canada on to the US missile defence program, strongly supported by the corporate and political elite.

Only a short time ago, the corporate elite was fixated on the need to replace Chrétien. Now, his successor Martin is being derided as indecisive. According to the Economist, Martin’s “faltering leadership has earned him the sobriquet of ‘Mr. Dithers’.”

Yet the most powerful sections of the bourgeoisie have little confidence in the Conservatives under Harper as an alternative. They remain concerned about Harper’s strong identification with the demands of Western-based business and political interests for a greater share of political power and are aghast over his crude appeals to religious conservatism—he has said gay marriage could be the first step toward the Liberals sanctioning polygamy—and over his failure to vigorously promote business’s neo-liberal agenda or offer Martin the Conservatives’ support on missile defence.

Even the National Post dismissed Harper’s claim that Martin wasn’t ready to stand behind the Gomery inquiry, when Chrétien sought to force the judge to step down, as “posturing,” adding that Harper’s “Conservative Party remains very much a work in progress.”

Canada’s corporate and political elite perceives itself to be falling behind in the global struggle for markets and profits and geo-political advantage and is increasingly frustrated at its inability to sideline public opposition to its drive for more tax cuts, the gutting of Medicare and other public services, the building up of the Canadian armed forces, and full Canadian participation in a Fortress America. This malaise has found expression in the hullabaloo over the sponsorship scandal.

The bourgeoisie, however, has numerous mechanisms, economic and political, to spur its political representatives rightward, manipulate public opinion and deflect and smother opposition—not least the trade unions and the NDP.

The opposition of working people remains inchoate and largely latent. It will only find coherent, progressive political expression through the struggle for a new political orientation—the mobilization of the working class as an independent and international class against the profit system.",corruption

Seven individuals were charged in an indictment in the District of South Carolina with laundering over $750,000 of fraudulently obtained funds, including over $390,000 obtained from a fraudulent Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loan. The seven individuals used a variety of methods to launder the money, including laundering the money through a casino. The indictment also identifies over $2.1 million in funds from twelve different bank accounts allegedly associated with the fraud scheme as subject to forfeiture which agents seized.

Acting Assistant Attorney General Brian C. Rabbitt of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division; U.S. Attorney Peter M. McCoy Jr. of the District of South Carolina; Special Agent in Charge Jody Norris of the FBI’s Columbia Field Office; Robert J. Murphy, the Special Agent in Charge of the DEA Atlanta Field Division, and Special Agent in Charge Kevin Kupperbusch of the Small Business Administration Office of Inspector General (SBA OIG) Eastern Region made the announcement.

Lauren Marcel Duhart, 34 of Stonecrest, Georgia, Joshua Bernard Smith, 39 of McDonough, Georgia, Steve Ronald Lewis, 43 of Snellville, Georgia, Christopher J. Agard, 41 of Marietta, Georgia, Henry Duffield, 58 of Belton, South Carolina, Jeremy Brandon Latourneau, 43 of Spartanburg, South Carolina, and Derick Keane, 43 of Spartanburg, South Carolina, were charged in an indictment filed in the District of South Carolina with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering. Duhart, Smith, and Agard were arrested this morning and appeared this afternoon before U.S. Magistrate Judge Kevin F. McDonald of the District of South Carolina.

In May 2020, Agard submitted a fraudulent PPP loan application for his business, Wild Stylz Entertainment, LLC, to a financial institution. In support of the application, Agard submitted fraudulent supporting documents that made numerous false and misleading statements about Wild Stylz’s number of employees and payroll expenses. The financial institution approved and funded a loan of over $395,000. Agard disseminated the fraudulently obtained funds to other members of the conspiracy to conceal the true nature of their fraudulently obtained funds. On May 27, 2020, Agard made $200,000 counter withdrawal at a bank branch. On May 28, 2020, Agard withdrew $50,000 in cash and made a $96,000 counter withdrawal. In June 2020, Duhart, Smith, and Lewis requested that Hunt provide Duhart, Smith, and Lewis with bank accounts in which to deposit fraudulently obtained PPP funds. Hunt had previously participated in drug trafficking and financial fraud with two South Carolina business owners. The two South Carolina business owners agreed to let Lewis use their business bank accounts in return for a percentage of the fraudulent funds deposited in their account. Hunt provided the two South Carolina business owner’s banking information and additional account access information to Lewis. During multiple recorded calls in early June 2020 Duhart, Lewis, Smith, and Hunt discussed the bank and wire fraud conspiracies. In one call, Lewis informed Hunt that the scheme involved fraudulent bank applications and that they needed to submit as many applications to the bank as possible by June 30th.

The indictment alleges that Agard also utilized his business, Wild Stylz, to launder the proceeds of other fraud schemes. In October of 2019, Lewis recruited Duffield to participate in a fraud scheme. As part of the scheme, Duffield allowed Agard to transfer $378,000 of fraud proceeds from the Wild Stylz business account to be deposited into Duffield’s business account in return for a portion of the proceeds. After the proceeds were deposited, Roosevelt Hunt (who has pled guilty to related charges), Latourneau, and Keane withdrew the funds from Duffield’s account by depositing checks totaling $200,000 at a casino. After gambling for less than two hours, Hunt, Keane, and Latourneau cashed out from the casino and left with approximately $198,750 in cash. Lewis met with Hunt to retrieve the cash which had been withdrawn from Duffield’s account. Lewis delivered a portion of the cash he picked up from Hunt to Duhart.

The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act is a federal law enacted March 29, 2020. It is designed to provide emergency financial assistance to millions of Americans who are suffering the economic effects resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. One source of relief provided by the CARES Act is the authorization of up to $349 billion in forgivable loans to small businesses for job retention and certain other expenses through the PPP. In April 2020, Congress authorized over $300 billion in additional PPP funding.

The PPP allows qualifying small businesses and other organizations to receive loans with a maturity of two years and an interest rate of one percent. Businesses must use PPP loan proceeds for payroll costs, interest on mortgages, rent and utilities. The PPP allows the interest and principal to be forgiven if businesses spend the proceeds on these expenses within a set time period and use at least a certain percentage of the loan towards payroll expenses.

An indictment is merely an allegation and all defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.

An international prosecutor has charged an ally of Kosovo's President Hashim Thaci with leading a crime ring responsible for a multimillion-dollar land scam and money laundering.

The European Union Rule of Law Mission in Kosovo (EULEX) made the charges against Azem Syla and 38 associates on October 25.

Syla is a former member of parliament and prominent politician in Thaci's ruling Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK).

In a statement, Kosovo prosecutor's office said Syla's crime syndicate was involved in illegally acquiring public property in Kosovo worth around $33 million.

The prosecutor's office added that the 39 defendants cooperated ""to deprive Kosovo of socially owned properties through criminal activities including the falsification of verdicts and of other official documents, fraud and corrupt behavior.""

Prosecutors said the criminal gang had been operating since 2006.

TMML2024033965188,John McAfee,"Alert ID: TMML2024033965188
Elusive cybersecurity pioneer John McAfee was arrested in Spain for tax evasion in the U.S., the Justice Department in Washington said.

McAfee is accused of failing to file U.S. tax returns from 2014 to 2018 and hiding assets including real estate, a vehicle and a yacht in the name of others, prosecutors said. An indictment returned in June was unsealed on Tuesday after he was taken into custody. He’s being held pending extradition, the Justice Department said.

He was arrested on Oct. 3 at Barcelona airport while traveling to Istanbul, according to an official at Spain’s national police force, who can’t be identified under internal policies.

U.S. prosecutors claim McAfee earned millions of dollars through the promotion of cryptocurrencies, speaking engagements, consulting jobs and the sale of the rights to his life story for a documentary, but never filed tax returns. Instead, his income was paid into accounts held in the names of others, prosecutors claim. He faces as long as five years in prison if convicted of tax evasion and a year if found guilty of failing to file taxes.

It’s the latest legal complication for the eccentric software mogul, who was a person of interest in a murder in Belize, though not charged with a crime, and last year he was detained in the Dominican Republic for entering the country with a cache of firearms and ammunition. He was also briefly a candidate for president in this year’s U.S. election, ending his run from abroad in March.

The criminal charges were announced just hours after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued McAfee for promoting the sale of cryptocurrencies without disclosing that he was being paid to do so.

The commission claims McAfee recommended at least seven initial coin offerings to his Twitter followers from at least November 2017 to February 2018 without revealing that he earned more than $23 million to boost them. He’s also accused of denying that he was being paid when asked by investors.

The SEC is seeking to force McAfee to disgorge all his ill-gotten gains, and to prohibit him from taking part in the issuance, purchase or sale of any digital asset securities and unspecified monetary penalties.

McAfee didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

The commission also accused McAfee of claiming to be an investor or technical advisor, “creating the impression that he had vetted these companies, that they were benefiting from his technical expertise, and that he was willing to invest in the ventures.”

When a blogger exposed that he was being paid, McAfee was still holding “virtually worthless” securities from the offerings he promoted and encouraged investors to buy them — without revealing that they were his own securities and he had paid a third party to recommend them, according to the complaint.

McAfee also engaged in a practice called scalping, in which he accumulated large amounts of digital securities and promoted them on Twitter without disclosing his intention to sell, the SEC said.

McAfee founded his epynonymous software firm in 1987. Intel Corp., seeking to build security features directly into its chips, bought the company for $7.7 billion in 2010, with TPG and Thoma Bravo taking stakes later. In 2016, Intel announced that it had signed a deal to transfer a 51% stake in the business to TPG for $1.1 billion. The company filed to go public last month.

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Federal prosecutors charged Texas billionaire Robert Brockman on Thursday with a $2 billion tax fraud scheme in what they say is the largest such case against an American.

Department of Justice officials said at a news conference that Brockman, 79, hid capital gains income over 20 years through a web of offshore entities in Bermuda and Nevis and secret bank accounts in Bermuda and Switzerland. Prosecutors announced that the CEO of a private equity firm that aided in the schemes would cooperate with the investigation.

The 39-count indictment unsealed Thursday charges Brockman, the chief executive officer of Ohio-based software company Reynolds and Reynolds Co., with tax evasion, wire fraud, money laundering, and other offenses.

Prosecutors also announced that Robert F. Smith, founder and chairman of Vista Equity Partners, will cooperate in the investigation and pay $139 million to settle his own tax probe. Smith, 57, stunned a senior class last year when he promised to wipe out the student loan debt of the entire graduating class at Morehouse, a historically Black all-male college.

“Complexity will not hide crime from law enforcement. Sophistication is not a defense to federal criminal charges,” said David L. Anderson, U.S. attorney for the Northern District of California. “We will not hesitate to prosecute the smartest guys in the room.”

Brockman appeared in federal court from Houston via Zoom Thursday. He entered a plea of not guilty to all counts and was released on $1 million bond, said Abraham Simmons, spokesman for the Northern District of California.

“Mr. Brockman has pled not guilty, and we look forward to defending him against these charges,” said his attorney, Kathryn Keneally, in an email.

Prosecutors said Brockman used encrypted emails with code names, including Permit, Snapper, Redfish and Steelhead, to carry out the fraud and ordered evidence to be manipulated or destroyed.

Brockman, a resident of Houston and Pitkin County, Colorado, is chairman and CEO of Reynolds and Reynolds, a 4,300-employee company near Dayton, Ohio, that sells accounting, sales and management software to auto dealerships. The software helps set up websites, including live chats with potential customers, find loans and calculate customer payments, manage payroll and pay bills.

Reynolds & Reynolds issued a statement saying the allegations were outside Brockman’s work with the company and that the company is not alleged to have participated in any wrongdoing.

In 2013, a charitable trust set up by Brockman’s late father withdrew a pledged $250 million donation to Centre College, a small liberal arts school in Danville, Kentucky, where Brockman attended class and once served as chairman of the board of trustees.

At the time the school said it was due to a “significant capital market event” that didn’t pan out. A spokesman for Reynolds and Reynolds said in 2013 that the event was a proposed refinancing deal involving Vista Equity Partners, Smith’s company.

According to the indictment, Brockman gave an unnamed individual detailed instructions regarding the proposed gift to the college, including talking points, and directed the person to threaten to pull out if his demands were not met. In August, he instructed the person to cancel the gift.

Prosecutors say that Smith used about $2.5 million in untaxed funds to buy and upgrade a vacation home in Sonoma, California; purchase two ski properties in France; and spend $13 million to buy a property and fund charitable activities at his property in Colorado.

Anderson applauded Smith for stepping up, despite the serious nature of his crimes, which occurred from 2000 to mid-2015.

“Smith’s agreement to cooperate has put him on a path away from indictment,” he said.

In 2019, Smith announced to the graduating class at Morehouse College that he would pay off the student loan debt of the entire class, saying that he expected the graduates to “pay it forward.” The estimated cost was $40 million.

Forbes lists Smith as #461 on its billionaires list, with a net worth of more than $5 billion.

He founded the tech investment firm Vista in 2000 and Forbes reports that it now has over $50 billion in assets and is “one of the best-performing private equity firms, posting annualized returns of 22% since inception.” Vista has offices in San Francisco and Oakland.

Mexico’s Attorney General Alejandro Gertz Manero announced Tuesday that prosecutors were opening a corruption investigation against former president Enrique Peña Nieto, who was in office from 2012 to 2018. This announcement follows accusations made against Peña Nieto by the former head of the oil company Petróleos Mexicanos (Pemex).

Emilio Lozoya, the former head of Pemex, was extradited from Spain in July to stand trial on corruption charges. He was accused of taking $10 million in bribes from Brazilian conglomerate Odebrecht.

Lozoya accused Peña Nieto and Peña Nieto’s former finance minister of instructing Lozoya to give bribes of more than 100 million pesos to finance Peña Nieto’s 2012 presidential campaign. This money was allegedly given to electoral advisors abroad. Lozoya also alleged that Peña Nieto similarly used bribes to buy votes while he was in office, bribing one deputy and five senators for their votes on reforms in 2013 and 2014.

On opening the investigation, Manero said:

From this moment on, the Office of the Attorney General of the Republic has opened the corresponding investigation file and we will begin to carry out all the procedures. First the ratifications, then the presentation of witnesses, the expert analysis of each one of the receipts, and the video.

Papa Massata Diack has goaded French authorities by saying they will have to send special forces to Senegal if he is to serve a five-year jail term handed out to him in France for corruption and breach of trust.

Diack, the son of former athletics global chief Lamine Diack who himself was given four years in prison for corruption and money-laundering, refused to leave Senegal for the trial and was sentenced in his absence.

In 2016, the global police network Interpol issued an arrest want for Papa Massata, who has been based in his West African nation ever since.

""They can send special forces to pick me up,"" he brazenly asserted on Monday as he continued to protest his innocence.

Lamine Diack: Former IAAF head found guilty of corruption and jailed

Last week, 87-year-old Lamine Diack was convicted of corruption in France in relation to a Russian doping scandal and sentenced to two years in prison, with another two years suspended.

Diack profited from a scheme that allowed Russian athletes who paid millions in bribes to keep competing when they should have been suspended for doping.

Safe in Senegal where local authorities have refused to extradite him to France, his son Papa Massata, a sports consultant who was also given a fine of $1.2m for his role in the affair, has been disdainful of the investigation into corruption in athletics.

French investigators say Papa Massata is at the centre of years-long corruption probe that now spans Europe, Asia and the Americas, and includes the awarding of the 2020 Olympic Games to Tokyo and the 2016 Games to Rio de Janeiro.

In 2017, Papa Massata branded the accusation that he was part of a large corruption racket as ""the biggest lie in the history of world sport.""

Since last week's verdict, his lawyers in Senegal have said he was denied a fair trial and would appeal.

""I don't need to racketeer athletes - I earned enough money to live well,"" he said in the Senegalese capital Dakar.

""What France, the country of human rights, did is abhorrent. What we've seen in Paris was an offence to justice, a joke.""

Not only has he accused the investigation of having a political background, he has also warned that his father could reveal some hidden truths in the world of sports administration should he wish to speak.

""I'm not afraid to say that there is racism in this story,"" Papa Massata, who was banned for life from athletics in 2016, ventured on Monday.

""There is a will to do morality, but that's not law, it's not a legal process, it's a moral process. They do not respect Africans and they have shown that with Lamine Diack, they do not respect anyone.

""Let me tell you now: I will react to any disclosure published in the press, because I also know things. The day Lamine Diack speaks about the Olympic movement, let me tell you, the IOC will explode, Fifa, the IAAF.""

Following a huge scandal that has hung over athletics for five years, Diack senior - who led the IAAF from 1999 to 2015 - was convicted of accepting bribes from athletes suspected of doping to cover up test results and letting them continue competing, including in the 2012 London Olympics.

In his testimony, he acknowledged slowing the handling of Russian doping cases between 2011-2013 to save a sponsorship deal with a Russian bank and avoid public scandal but he denied the corruption allegations.

Diack's lawyers said he would be appealing against the judgement, which they called ""unfair and inhumane"".",corruption

RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - State prosecutors in Rio de Janeiro said late on Tuesday they have formally pressed charges against Flavio Bolsonaro, President Jair Bolsonaro’s eldest son, over his alleged participation in a scheme to siphon off public funds.

A former aide, Fabricio Queiroz, was also charged along with another 15 people whom prosecutors did not name.

Prosecutors have been investigating an alleged corruption ring in which Flavio Bolsonaro would receive part of the salaries paid to cabinet staff when he was a member of the Rio de Janeiro state legislature, a scheme known as “rachadinha” in Brazil.

Prosecutors say the alleged scam lasted between 2007 and 2018.

Braun resigned as CEO on Friday, suggesting that Wirecard itself may have been the victim of a massive fraud. Jan Marsalek, a board member and chief operating officer at the company, was fired on Monday.

Founded in 1999, Wirecard was once considered one of the most promising tech firms in Europe. It processes payments for consumers and businesses, and sells data analytics services. The company has nearly 6,000 employees in 26 countries around the world.

Braun, who also served as Wirecard's chief technology officer, had led the company since 2002. The former KPMG consultant is the company's largest shareholder, with holdings of just over 7%, according to data from Refinitiv.

Wirecard grew quickly with Braun at the helm. The company reported revenues of over €2 billion ($2.2 billion) in 2018, or more than four times the figure from 2013. Shares hit an all-time high above €190 ($213) in September 2018, the same month Wirecard replaced Commerzbank (CRZBF) in Germany's list of top 30 companies. At that point, it was worth more than €24 billion ($26.9 billion).

The company now faces an existential crisis. A frantic search for the missing money ran into a dead end over the weekend in the Philippines, where the central bank denied the cash had entered the country's financial system. The company's shares plummeted on Monday, extending a crash that wiped 85% off its share price over three trading sessions. Wirecard ended the day with a market value of €1.7 billion ($1.9 billion).

Wirecard is scrambling to keep creditors at bay, a task that could be complicated by the arrest of its former CEO. The company said late Friday that it had hired investment bank Houlihan Lokey to come up with a new financing strategy.

'Total disaster'

German finance minister Olaf Scholz described the scandal as ""extremely worrying"" on Tuesday, saying the country must act quickly to improve oversight of companies such as Wirecard. ""Critical questions arise over the supervision of the company, especially with regards to accounting and balance sheet control. Auditors and supervisory bodies do not seem to have been effective here,"" Scholz said in a statement.

The Federal Financial Supervisory Authority, or BaFin, said last week that it is actively investigating whether Wirecard violated rules against market manipulation. But Felix Hufeld, who leads the regulator and sits on the European Central Bank's supervisory board, described the scandal as a ""total disaster.""

""It is a scandal that something like this could happen,"" Hufeld said, in comments that were reported by Reuters and confirmed by the regulator.

The implosion follows a tumultuous 18 months for the company punctuated by allegations of fraud, attacks by short sellers and questions over its accounting practices.

The success story began to unravel in January 2019, when the Financial Times reported that Wirecard forged and backdated contracts in a string of suspicious transactions in Singapore. The company denied the report, which was produced with the help of a whistleblower, but its shares plummeted. In February 2019, authorities in Singapore said they would investigate.

Another blow landed late last year, when the FT published a report and company documents suggesting that profits and sales had been inflated at Wirecard outposts in Dubai and Ireland. Wirecard again denied the allegations. But an investigation by KPMG published in April found the company had not provided enough information to fully explain issues raised by the FT.

Braun explained his decision to quit last week in a letter to employees and shareholders.

""The confidence of the capital market in the company I have been managing for 18 years has been deeply shaken ... I respect the fact that responsibility for all business transactions lies with the CEO,"" said Braun.",

MINNEAPOLIS (Reuters) - The white former Minneapolis police officer shown in video footage using his knee to pin an unarmed black man’s neck to the street was charged with murder on Friday in the man’s death, an incident that has unleashed four nights of violent protests.

Derek Chauvin, who was dismissed from the police department with three fellow officers the day after the fatal encounter, was arrested on third-degree murder and manslaughter charges for his role in Monday’s death of 46-year-old George Floyd.

Graphic video footage taken by an onlooker’s cell phone and widely circulated on the internet shows Floyd - with Chauvin’s knee pressed into his neck - gasping for air and repeatedly groaning, “Please, I can’t breathe,” while a crowd of bystanders shouted at police to let him up.

After several minutes, Floyd gradually grows unresponsive and ceases to move. He was pronounced dead at a local hospital a short time later.

The video reignited an outpouring of rage that civil rights activists said has long simmered in Minneapolis and cities across the country over persistent racial bias in the U.S. criminal justice system.

The charges brought by Hennepin County prosecutors came after a third night of arson, looting and vandalism in which protesters set fire to a police station, and the National Guard was deployed to help restore order in Minnesota’s largest city.

Authorities had hoped Chauvin’s arrest would allay public anger and avert continued unrest. But defying an 8 p.m. curfew imposed by Mayor Jacob Frey, about 500 demonstrators clashed anew Friday evening with riot police outside the battered Third Precinct building.

Police, creating a two-block buffer area around the precinct house, opened fire with tear gas, plastic bullets and concussion grenades, scattering the crowd.

Another group of protesters later converged near the city’s Fifth Precinct station until police arrived and fired tear gas and plastic bullets to break up that gathering. A nearby bank and post office were set on fire.

Still, Friday night’s crowds were far smaller and more widely dispersed than the night before. Law enforcement kept a mostly low profile, a strategy seemingly calculated to reduce the risk of violent confrontations, as was the case in several urban centers across the country where sympathy protests arose.

Among the larger cities with protests on Friday were Los Angeles, Denver, Houston, Atlanta and Louisville, Kentucky.

A 19-year-old man protesting in Detroit was shot dead on Friday night by a suspect who pulled up to demonstrators in a sport utility vehicle and fired gunshots into the crowd, then fled, the Detroit Free Press and other local media reported.

Few if any other serious injuries or deaths have been reported in connection with the protests.

In Washington, police and Secret Service agents were out in force around the White House before dozens of demonstrators gathered across the street in Lafayette Square chanting, “I can’t breathe.”

Thousands of chanting protesters filled the streets of New York City’s Brooklyn borough near the Barclays Center indoor arena. Police armed with batons and pepper spray made scores of arrests in sometimes violent clashes.

Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman, announcing Chauvin’s arrest earlier in the day, said a key piece of evidence in the case was the video clip showing Floyd lying face down in the street, with Chauvin kneeling on the back of Floyd’s neck.

“We have evidence, we have the citizen’s camera’s video, the horrible, horrific, terrible thing we have all seen over and over again,” Freeman said. “We have the officer’s body-worn camera, we have statements from some witnesses.”

Chauvin had his knee on Floyd’s neck for nearly 9 minutes, according to an autopsy report. Medical examiners found the combined impact of being restrained by police, underlying health conditions and any potential intoxicants in his system likely contributed to his death.

Floyd, a Houston native who had worked security for a nightclub, was arrested for allegedly using counterfeit money at a store to buy cigarettes on Monday evening. An employee who called police described the suspect as possibly drunk, according to an official transcript of the call.

Freeman said the investigation into Chauvin, who faces up to 25 years in prison if convicted, was ongoing and he anticipated also charging the three other officers, identified by the city as Thomas Lane, Tou Thao and J Alexander Kueng.

Floyd’s death recalled the 2014 killing of Eric Garner, an unarmed black man in New York City, who died after being put in a police chokehold and telling the officers, “I can’t breathe.”

Mike Griffin, a community organizer in Minneapolis, said the protests reflected years of frustration over economic inequalities and the feeling that black lives were not valued as highly by police.

He said anger has been building since the 2015 fatal shooting by Minneapolis police of 24-year-old Jamar Clark, and the 2016 killing of Philando Castile, a 32-year old black man shot by Minnesota police during a traffic stop.

“George’s murder was just the last straw,” Griffin told Reuters, calling the charges against Chauvin a step in the right direction, but adding there needed to be systemic changes.

The protests were driven in part by the initial lack of arrests in the case.

But Freeman stressed that charges in similar cases typically take nine months to a year, adding, “This is by far the fastest we’ve ever charged a police officer.”

Earlier on Friday, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz said he understood why people had “lost faith” in the police but argued Floyd’s plight had become “lost in 48 hours of anarchy” and called for an end to destruction of property. He has declared a state of emergency and called in the state’s National Guard.",focus on policeman murder

(AP Photo/Lefteris Pitarakis)

LONDON—Russian tycoon Roman Abramovich paid $2 billion to fellow oligarch Boris Berezovsky for his services as a political godfather in the turbulent years after the collapse of communism, Abramovich's lawyer said Tuesday.

The two former allies are facing off in a London court, where Berezovsky is suing Abramovich for 3.2 billion pounds ($5 billion).

Berezovsky, who lives in self-imposed exile in Britain, claims Abramovich intimidated him into selling shares in Russian oil company Sibneft at a fraction of their value. He alleges breach of trust and breach of contract.

Abramovich's lawyer, Jonathan Sumption, denied the allegation Tuesday, explaining that in corrupt and chaotic post-Soviet Russia Berezovsky was a ""power broker"" to whom Abramovich businesses paid large sums for patronage.

Sumption said that in Russia at the time, ""there was no rule of law.""

""The police were corrupt,"" he said. ""The courts were unpredictable at best ... Nobody could go into business without access to political power. If you didn't have political power yourself you needed access to a godfather who did.""

Sumption said the two men had agreed that ""for substantial cash payments, Mr. Abramovich and Sibneft would enjoy Mr. Berezovsky's political patronage.""

He said that between 1995 and 2002, Berezovsky, then a media mogul, received $2 billion from Abramovich businesses, as well as money for personal expenses including ""palaces in France,"" private planes, artworks and jewelry.

But he said Berezovsky did not put money into Sibneft, which was created during the breakup of Russia's state-owned businesses, and was not the registered owner of its shares.

""His contribution was important, indeed it was indispensable,"" said Sumption. ""But it was almost entirely political.""

Berezovsky, a Kremlin insider during the rule of Boris Yeltsin, fled to Britain after Vladimir Putin became Russia's president in 2000. He has since been a vocal critic of the Kremlin.

Berezovsky's lawyer, Laurence Rabinowitz, said Monday that relations between the two oligarchs turned sour after Berezovsky fell out with Russian political leaders. He claimed Abramovich then betrayed him in return for wealth and influence.

""It is our case that Mr. Abramovich at that point demonstrated that he was a man to whom wealth and influence mattered more than friendship and loyalty,"" he said.

Abramovich sold Sibneft to Russia's state-owned gas monopoly Gazprom in a multibillion-dollar deal in 2005. He now owns London's Chelsea Football Club.

The two men were at London's High Court for the first two days of the case, which is expected to last two months.",corruption about two disgusting guys

Eta claim independence for seven regions in Spain and France

Three suspected Eta bomb plotters arrested in Britain last year have been extradited to Spain, police have said.

The three suspects include men aged 24 and 29 and a woman aged 36. They were arrested in April in Sheffield.

They are accused by the Spanish authorities of involvement in a 2006 bomb attack on a naval office building.

The names of the three extradited suspects are: Inigo Albisu Hernandez, 24, Zigor Ruiz Jaso, 29, and Ana Isabel Lopez Monge, 36.

Their extradition was ordered on 17 August last year. Their removal from the country follows all of their appeals having been exhausted.

Bloody campaign

The three were extradited on a flight that left at 1200 GMT.

Lawyers for the group had appealed against their extradition on the basis that the arrest warrants they had been detained under were defective.

The lawyers had argued that returning them to Spain would expose them to inhumane and degrading treatment.

At the time their extradition orders were made, City of Westminster Magistrates' Court heard the three suspects had come together as a ""reserve cell"" after a former ""command"" had been stood down.

Franco dictatorship

Melanie Cumberland, representing the Spanish judicial authority, said Ruiz was alleged to have carried out the February 2006 attack, for which Eta claimed responsibility, in Motrico, Spain.

No-one was hurt in the attack, although there was damage done to property.

For more than three decades, Eta waged a bloody campaign for independence for the seven regions in northern Spain and south-west France that Basque separatists claim as their own.

Euskadi Ta Azkatasuna, or Eta, whose name stands for Basque Homeland and Freedom, first emerged in the 1960s as a student resistance movement bitterly opposed to General Franco's repressive military dictatorship.

Following the Spanish Civil War, the Basque language was banned - although it was being taught in private schools by the 1950s - the Basque's distinctive culture suppressed and intellectuals imprisoned and tortured for their political and cultural beliefs.",suspects of bomb planting

A shadowy network of South Florida properties worth tens of millions of dollars and revealed in the Panama Papers could become a campaign issue in Argentina as former president Cristina Fernández de Kirchner makes her political comeback while fighting corruption indictments.

Fernández de Kirchner is running for Argentina’s Senate in an Oct. 22 election but is opposed by the party of current president Mauricio Macri.

Now, the nation’s top anti-corruption official, Laura Alonso, has made a stunning claim on national television, saying Fernández de Kirchner owns more than 60 properties in Miami bought with “dirty money.” Alonso said investigators had linked the properties to a top aide to Fernández de Kirchner’s husband, Néstor Kirchner, who preceded her as president.

Last year, a Miami Herald investigation found that companies linked to the aide had scooped up nearly $70 million worth of real estate in South Florida and New York.

Fernández de Kirchner’s attorney told the Miami Herald she owns no properties in Miami.

“Everything Laura Alonso said lacks seriousness and is also false,” said Gregorio Dalbón, who called the allegations politically motivated.

Alonso runs Argentina’s Anti-Corruption Office, which is part of the executive branch and answers to Macri. Her staff declined to provide details that would buttress her claims, saying they could not discuss ongoing investigations, despite the fact that Alonso made the accusations on a widely watched national news program.

The deals linked to the aide, Héctor Daniel Muñoz, were revealed in the massive trove of offshore documents known as the Panama Papers. The Herald did not find evidence that the Kirchners participated. And it discovered only 16 properties, ranging from Brickell condos to a CVS pharmacy in Little Havana, not 60. All of the properties have been sold, many since the Herald first reported on the story.

Federal prosecutors in Argentina were already investigating the properties tied to Muñoz before Alonso’s announcement.

In her appearance on news channel Todo Noticias last month, Alonso indicated Argentine authorities want to seize the 60 alleged Miami properties.

“We’re working to recover those assets using a strategy of international collaboration,” said Alonso, who described the real estate as “just the tip of the iceberg of all of the money that is likely distributed in the darkest circuits of the international financial system.”

She called the funds “dirty money that in reality belongs to all Argentines.”

In an interview Thursday, a spokeswoman for the Anti-Corruption Office, Graciela Fusco, confirmed that the agency is investigating 60 Miami properties. She said investigators believe the properties were purchased with laundered money and that they belong to Fernández de Kirchner. But Fusco clarified that the investigation is ongoing. Her boss, Alonso, had seemed to state the allegations as fact.

“It still has to be proven,” Fusco said.

The Anti-Corruption Office will not release further information. “Until the investigation is finished, we can’t share anything,” Fusco said. Once the office has collected sufficient evidence, the information will be turned over to prosecutors, she said.

It’s unclear whether the 16 properties previously identified by the Herald are part of the investigation. Fusco said she did not know which properties the office is looking at.

Argentina’s major newspapers have not covered Alonso’s allegations, perhaps because of her office’s reluctance to provide details.

Wyn Hornbuckle, a spokesman for the U.S. Department of Justice, declined to comment when asked if Argentina’s government had asked the United States to seize any properties.

South Florida’s real estate market is known as a haven for dirty cash, sparking a federal crackdown on secretive home purchases by shell companies.

Fernández de Kirchner, a populist who served as president between 2007 and 2015, faces two unrelated indictments for corruption. The charges stem from allegations of impropriety over public works contracts. She says they are political retribution.

In April, an Argentine court froze $8.5 million of her assets, the New York Times reported.

Despite the charges, Fernández de Kirchner won a non-binding Senate primary last month for Buenos Aires province, just barely beating a candidate favored by Macri. The two face off again later this month. Even if she finishes second, Fernández de Kirchner will still be installed in the Senate, thanks to the nation’s electoral system of proportional representation.

Her bid is seen as a test of her popularity before Argentina’s 2019 presidential election, when she may seek to unseat Macri, according to Reuters.

Panama Papers

Muñoz was Kirchner’s closest aide, a “body man” and private secretary who was nearly always at the president’s side. He also worked for Fernández de Kirchner’s administration.

Kirchner affectionately referred to his companion as el gordo, or “fatty.”

Both men are dead: Kirchner died of heart failure in 2010 at the age of 60, Muñoz of cancer in 2016 when he was 59.

The purchases linked to Muñoz include luxury condos in Brickell and Sunny Isles Beach, apartments in Manhattan’s Plaza Hotel and pricey South Florida commercial buildings leased to major banks. But his name didn’t appear in deeds or Florida corporate documents. Instead, public records listed an Argentine couple, now divorced, as the managers of the companies. One of the managers, Elizabeth Municoy, runs a realty firm in Surfside.

While the deals were being closed, Municoy’s husband, Sergio Todisco, served as the director of a British Virgin Islands company called Gold Black Limited.

The real owners of Gold Black were Muñoz and his wife, according to one of the 11.5 million leaked files from Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca that were published by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists and its media partners, including the Herald. Todisco confirmed to Argentine media that Muñoz owned Gold Black.

The owners of BVI companies are allowed to keep their identities hidden from public view, making them a magnet for rogues, according to U.S. law enforcement officials and advocates for corporate transparency.

After the South Florida deals were revealed last year, a federal prosecutor in Argentina, Juan Manuel Pettigiani, launched an investigation to determine if Muñoz was using Todsico and Municoy to mask the laundering of stolen funds.

“What motivated the investigation was a suspicion that the people who appeared as the property owners did not have the financial means to pay for them,” he told the Herald recently. His investigation obtained bank records for the couple.

He has since passed the probe on to a team of financial-crimes prosecutors, as required by Argentine law.

Municoy declined to comment last week on Alonso’s allegations. She insisted she had nothing to do with Muñoz.

Macri himself has faced accusations of wrongdoing because of his family’s offshore investments.

But a judge ruled in September that Macri’s role in his father’s offshore companies did not violate Argentine law, according to Argentine newspaper La Nacion. The president’s connection to the companies was also revealed in the Panama Papers.

Conrad Black's full pardon came a year after publishing his glowing biography, ""Donald J. Trump: A President Like No Other.""
The onetime media baron was convicted of fraud and obstructing justice in a scheme blamed for taking down what was one of the world's biggest newspaper companies.
Until being bought out, Black partnered with Mr. Trump in building Trump International Hotel & Tower Chicago.

The name Conrad Black may not ring a bell for some Americans, but the onetime media baron, society figure and now a recipient of a presidential pardon was in the public spotlight for years. Deported to Canada in 2012 after spending more than three years in prison, Black had been found guilty of fraud and obstruction of justice. His long and colorful history includes a long-standing alliance with President Trump.

Born in Canada, Black eventually became a British lord and is described in press accounts as a millionaire who lived like a billionaire. When criticized for allegedly using shareholder money to finance a vacation to Bora Bora and charging an extravagant birthday party for his wife to his company, he reportedly declared that he would ""not re-enact the French Revolutionary renunciation of the rights of the nobility."" He was acquitted of charges related to both incidents.

""A President Like No Other""

In his 20s, Black and longtime business partner David Radler turned an investment in an English-language daily in Quebec into a company that ran more than 300 newspapers. He became a convicted felon decades later when he and other executives were accused of looting about $32 million from Hollinger International, which owned entities including the Chicago Sun-Times, Canada's National Post, the U.K.'s Daily Telegraph and the Jerusalem Post. Radler pleaded guilty in the scheme blamed for taking down what at the time was among the biggest newspaper companies in the world.

When Black was at the helm, the Sun-Times in the early 2000s sold its building alongside the Chicago River to Mr. Trump, leading to the present-day Trump International Hotel & Tower Chicago. The two were partners in the undertaking until Mr. Trump bought out Black.

The full pardon came a day after the National Review published an essay by Black headlined: ""Smooth Sailing Ahead for Trump,"" and a year after the publication of Black's book, ""Donald J. Trump: A President Like No Other."" The 74-year-old Black has authored other presidential biographies, including ""Richard M. Nixon: A Life in Full,"" in 2007.

""Mr. Black is entirely deserving"" of the pardon, the White House said in a statement. It touted him as having made ""tremendous contributions to business, as well as to political and historical thought.""

Switzerland and Uzbekistan have agreed to the terms under which Bern may return to Tashkent some $131 million seized from the disgraced daughter of former President Islam Karimov. But activists say Uzbekistan does not have institutions to ensure the massive infusion of cash is not looted by regime insiders.

Gulnara Karimova stashed almost $1 billion in Switzerland, funds that prosecutors say were the proceeds from bribes that three foreign mobile operators paid her to receive operating licenses in Uzbekistan. In addition to the $131 million that Bern is prepared to release, about $700 million more is still frozen and could one day be made available to Tashkent under the same conditions.

The memorandum of understanding is not yet legally binding, but it is likely to be celebrated by Tashkent as evidence of President Shavkat Mirziyoyev’s reform agenda.

Dwelling on the corruption of the Karimov era looks like a low-risk proposition for the country’s current rulers, not least as it serves as another way of emphasizing the purported break with past practices. But the persisting restrictions applied to the work of independent media means that documenting the corruption happening today is still often complicated, if not outright impossible.

The fact that activists are having to demand transparency into how Karimova’s frozen assets are used, should they ever be returned, and how reluctant the Swiss authorities have been in acceding to Uzbek requests for repatriation of that money, illustrates the continued lack of trust in the government’s anti-graft pledges.

Under the terms of the September 11 “framework agreement,” Tashkent will use the restitution transparently and accountably ""to improve the living conditions of the people of Uzbekistan"" and invest ""in projects which support sustainable development"" as defined by the United Nations. The memorandum calls for the ""establishment of a monitoring mechanism"" and says that legally binding agreements are to be negotiated ""in the near future.”

While praising Swiss officials for taking an important step, the Uzbek activists are calling for anti-corruption reforms to be implemented in Uzbekistan before the funds are returned, as well as a number of loopholes in the framework to be closed.

""Unless its proposed potential conditions are very strictly applied, the document will not succeed in preventing the restituted funds being re-appropriated by corrupt government networks,"" warned the Uzbek Forum for Human Rights and other civil society groups in a September 16 letter. ""The agreement requires evidence of further domestic reform given the political and institutional environment in Uzbekistan.""

Karimova’s fall from grace began even before her father died in September 2016. She was arrested in Tashkent in August 2015 on charges including corruption and tax evasion.

Following a secretive trial, Tashkent regional court in December 2017 sentenced Karimova to 10 years of “limited freedom,” which in effect meant house arrest. She later pledged to assist in recovering funds said to have been improperly acquired, prompting the court to commute the sentence to five years. In 2019, however, the court ordered Karimova to be moved to prison after finding that she had violated the terms of her house arrest.

In a letter addressed to President Mirziyoyev this past February, Karimova wrote that she was prepared to relinquish claims to $700 million held in frozen Swiss banks accounts in exchange for clemency in her case.

Far from winning her a reprieve, this attempt at negotiation appears to have landed Karimova in only more trouble.

In March, another court found Karimova guilty on multiple counts, including embezzlement and extortion, and sentenced her to 13 years in prison. The sentence is to apply from the date of her first arrest and will be served concurrently with earlier sentences.

Karimova was indicted last year on conspiracy and money laundering charges in New York, where she “stands accused of exploiting her official position to solicit and accept more than $865 million in bribes from three publicly traded telecom companies, and then laundering those bribes through the U.S. financial system,” the Justice Department said in a statement.",a part of the text denounces Karimova's corruption

The Hollywood producer Riza Aziz, stepson of the former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak, has been arrested on suspicion of money laundering.

Mr Aziz, who produced The Wolf of Wall Street, starring Leonardo DiCaprio, was detained in Malaysia and bailed.

US prosecutors have accused Mr Aziz's production company of misappropriating money from a multi-billion dollar state fund to finance the film.

Mr Aziz's stepfather and mother have both been charged with corruption.

Mr Aziz will appear in court on Friday to face charges, said Latheefa Koya, the head of Malaysia's anti-corruption agency.

He has denied any wrongdoing. His production company, Red Granite, has already settled a civil lawsuit with the US government.

ISTANBUL: Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Tuesday congratulated Joe Biden on his victory over Donald Trump in the US presidential election, urging closer ties between the two NATO allies.
Erdogan’s statement came a full three days after US media called the election in Biden’s favor, underscoring the close personal bond the Turkish leader enjoyed with Trump.
But Ankara and Washington also experienced tensions during Trump’s four years in office, including over US support for a Syrian Kurdish militia that Turkey views as a grave security threat.
“I congratulate you on your election success and convey my sincere wishes for the peace and welfare of the US people,” Erdogan said in a statement published by his office, urging “strong cooperation” between the sides.
Other issues standing between Ankara and Washington include Turkey’s purchase of a high-tech Russian missile defense system, and US refusal to extradite a Muslim cleric Erdogan blames for staging a failed 2016 coup.
“The challenges we face today, on the global and regional levels, require us to further develop and strengthen those relations, which are based in mutual interests and shared values,” Erdogan said.
Turkish officials have been alarmed by an interview Biden gave to The New York Times in December in which he called Erdogan an “autocrat.”
Biden criticized the Turkish leader’s policies toward the Kurds and said Washington needed to “embolden” his rivals to allow them “to take on and defeat Erdogan.”

In 2016, South Korea saw the start of a massive corruption scandal involving its political and business elite that brought down its first female president Park Geun-hye.

The scandal, which continues to ripple through South Korean society, generated huge protests.

It has centred on Park's relationship with an old friend, Choi Soon-sil, and has brought to the surface allegations of cult activities, influence-peddling and leaks of classified information.

What is the relationship at the heart of the scandal?

In 1974, Park Geun-hye's mother was killed by a North Korean assassin.

Park, then aged 22, became a stand-in first lady for her widowed father, then-military leader Park Chung-hee.

image copyrightReuters

She got to know Choi Tae-min, a pseudo-Christian cult leader dubbed ""the Korean Rasputin"".

He became a close family friend and Park's mentor, while also amassing considerable wealth and power.

Park's father was assassinated in 1979. By this point she was firm friends with Mr Choi's daughter, Choi Soon-sil, who later became her adviser when Park became president.

image copyrightReuters

Their critics believe Choi perpetuated her father's habits, and some media reports suggested that Ms Park held shamanist rituals at the presidential compound under Choi's influence, which Park denied.

Why did the friendship become problematic?

In February 2018, Choi was sentenced to 20 years in jail for corruption, influence-peddling and abuse of power. She was earlier found guilty of using her position to solicit favours for her daughter.

Choi was found to have had used her presidential connections to pressure conglomerates - including electronics giant Samsung - for millions of dollars in donations to two non-profit foundations she controlled.

Park meanwhile has been accused of colluding with Choi, and giving her unauthorised access to state documents.

image copyrightReuters

Ms Park was officially ousted in March 2017, following parliament's decision to impeach her in December. She was the country's first democratically-elected president to be forced from office.

After losing her presidential immunity, she was charged with bribery, abusing state power and leaking state secrets.

Both women denied wrongdoing in their trials.

image copyrightAFP

They had earlier apologised, but it was unclear exactly what they were apologising for.

Choi said she had committed an ""unpardonable crime"", though her lawyer said this was not a legal admission of guilt.

Park admitted she had committed lapses, and apologised to the public for causing ""national concern"".

So how is Samsung involved?

The firm was one of eight that has admitted making payments to the foundation, but denied it did so in return for any favours.

In August 2017, Samsung's de facto head, Lee Jae-yong, was jailed for five years for bribery and embezzlement. He was later freed in February after an appeals court reduced and suspended his sentence.

image copyrightGetty Images

Lee was convicted over payments of 43bn won ($36.4m; £30.3m) made to Choi's foundations, as well as for giving a horse and several million dollars to assist the equestrian career of Choi's daughter.

Prosecutors had accused Lee of approving these payments and gifts in order to win government support for a major restructuring of Samsung.

The 2015 merger of two Samsung units, which paved the way for Lee to become the eventual head of South Korea's largest conglomerate, sparked controversy at that time.

While Lee did not dispute that the payments were made, he maintained during his trial that he was not involved in the decisions and denied that he sought government favours.

Lee was also found guilty of hiding assets overseas, concealing criminal proceeds, and perjury.

Who is Samsung's Lee Jae-yong?

Is anyone else involved?

A host of other players have either been implicated, investigated or jailed in connection with the wide-reaching scandal.

These include Samsung executives, various figures in the entertainment world, a former minister, presidential aides, university officials and former associates.

One of them is Choi's daughter, Chung Yoo-ra, a former national equestrian and recipient of Samsung's gift horse.

image copyrightReuters

Choi was convicted for influencing officials at Ms Chung's university to admit her daughter and give her grades for papers or exams she never took.

Prosecutors say Ms Chung was involved in or had knowledge of several of her mother's crimes, but she has denied it.

She was extradited to South Korea from Denmark in early 2017, but has not been detained.

How has the scandal affected South Korean society?

Since it began the whole affair prompted numerous mass protests in South Korea, many of which called for Park to step down.

It fuelled discontent against the government, the political elite and family-run conglomerates which dominate South Korea's economy.

It also propelled the liberal Moon Jae-in, who campaigned on a platform of a clean government, into power after Park.

How identity politics fuelled South Korean scandal

Though Choi and Lee have been convicted, much of the attention has still been focused on Park.

The verdicts in the corruption trial of former global athletics chief Lamine Diack, his son and four others will be handed down in a Paris court on Wednesday.

The older Diack, an 87-year-old Senegalese, who was in charge of the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF), now renamed World Athletics, between 1999 and 2015, is charged with ""giving and receiving bribes"", ""breach of trust"" and ""organised money laundering"".

The prosecution alleged that Diack obtained $1.5 million of Russian funds in exchange for the IAAF's anti-doping arm covering up or delaying offences by 23 Russians to allow them to compete in the 2012 London Olympics and the 2013 World Athletics Championships in Moscow.

Prosecutors have called for Diack to serve four years in prison and be fined up to 500,000 euros ($560,000).

Diack told the court it was his decision to delay bans after the athletes failed tests in 2011, but he denied knowing that officials from the body had directly or indirectly asked those athletes for hundreds of thousands of euros to hush up their cases.

He said he was acting to safeguard ""the financial health of the IAAF"" because the federation was negotiating major sponsorship contracts with Russian bank VTB and a Russian broadcaster at the time.

Diack, who was decorated in the Kremlin in late 2011, denied taking Russian funds to finance the successful campaign by Macky Sall for the Senegal presidency.

His son Papa Massata Diack, who worked as a marketing consultant to the IAAF, remains in Senegal, which refuses to extradite him. He has been tried in absentia on charges including corruption and money laundering.

In a press conference in Senegal's capital Dakar on Monday, Papa Massata, who is 55, declared himself ""innocent"" and argued that the French court had no jurisdiction.

He said he was not a French resident and that his companies are registered in his native Senegal.

Senegalese authorities are conducting their own investigation and he is facing similar charges to the ones filed in France.

Papa Massata accused British authorities of being behind the charges -- which he termed ""the biggest lie in the history of world sport"" -- in a bid to secure the IAAF presidency.

Sebastian Coe, who took over from Lamine Diack, is British and a double Olympic gold medallist at 1,500 metres.

- 'In the evening of his life' -

The court has heard that World Athletics is claiming 41.2 million euros compensation from the Diacks for loss of sponsorship.

Prosecutors are also seeking prison sentences for the former head of anti-doping at the IAAF, Gabriel Dolle, lawyer Habib Cisse who was Lamine Diack's advisor, as well as two Russian officials tried in their absence, the former president of the national athletics federation Valentin Balakhnichev and the former coach Alexei Melnikov.

Diack gave often inaudible and confused testimony. One of his lawyers, William Bourdon, asked that the judges ""do not take a decision that stops him from dying with dignity, surrounded by his loved ones, on his native land"".

The prosecution asked the court to punish a ""huge breach of probity that has caused worldwide damage"", even if Diack is ""in the evening of his life"".

The verdict will not mark the end of the Diacks' dealings with the French justice system. The father, a former International Olympic Committee member, and son are subjects of a second investigation on suspicions of corruption in the allocation of the 2016 Olympics to Rio and the postponed 2020 Games to Tokyo.

Nine bodies were discovered dumped in a bloody pile outside a home Thursday in Nuevo Laredo, just across the Texas border, Mexican officials said.

Five women and four men were found with a handwritten sign left on top of their bodies, not far from an international bridge that connects to the U.S., a Tamaulipas state official told The Associated Press. The official spoke on condition of anonymity.

The banner read, ""This is not a joke, nephew,"" according to photos from local media.

Such messages are often left by drug cartels as warnings to rivals.

Nuevo Laredo has long been dominated by the Zetas cartel, which has splintered into factions after the arrest or killing of top leaders.

The bodies were on a sidewalk near a sports complex at the intersection of Abraham Lincoln and Porfirio Diaz streets, The Laredo Morning Times reports.

""I just passed by that street and the people who live there were washing those sidewalks, the hideous blood odor,"" someone reportedly commented on a Facebook photo of the bodies.

The state prosecutor's office said it is investigating the killings.

Last week, Ivàn ""El Taliban"" Velázquez Caballero, who rose through the ranks of the Zetas, received a 30-year prison sentence for drug-trafficking and money-laundering charges he pleaded guilty to in 2014, the Laredo Morning Times reported.

The day before the discovery of the bodies, an old faction of the Zetas, La Vieja Guardia, threatened the younger generation of Zetas, the Cartel del Noreste, in a message that's circulating on social media, the paper reports.

""People of Nuevo Laredo, tell your children to stop frequenting the night clubs,"" the message states. ""All of the sudden, we will throw out grenades and burn down the clubs and everything that finances the Norestitas [CDN members].""

It was signed by Z-47 and Z-33.

Eduardo Mendoza Robles has been identified as Z-33 by the U.S. government, which says he's a fugitive wanted for trafficking drugs and weapons.

MIAMI (Reuters) - A U.S. court sentenced the brother of jailed Colombian drug lord Diego Montoya to 30 years in prison on Tuesday for conspiring to import cocaine into the United States.

Eugenio Montoya Sanchez was a high-ranking member of the Norte del Valle cocaine cartel and was responsible for managing its finances, including maintaining cartel stash houses to store the cash proceeds of drug deals, prosecutors said.

Montoya Sanchez was arrested by Colombian authorities after a shootout in January 2007 and was extradited to Florida in June. He pleaded guilty in January in a federal court in Miami.

Montoya Sanchez told prosecutors the cartel kept up to $20 million (14 million pounds) in cash in stash houses around Colombia. He said he used drug proceeds to invest in real estate and outside businesses, as well as to fund cocaine labs and pay lab workers, cocaine transporters and security personnel.

He was the third member of the family convicted in the case. His brother Juan Carlos Montoya Sanchez and cousin Carlos Felipe Toro Sanchez both pleaded guilty to drug conspiracy charges in 2005 and were sentenced to 21 and 19 years in prison respectively.

Diego Montoya, who was extradited to Florida in December and is still awaiting trial, was a leading figure in Colombia’s underworld. He helped found the Norte del Valle cartel and appeared next to Osama bin Laden on the FBI’s “Ten Most Wanted” list.",sentenced

Paul Singer. (Photo: World Economic Forum / Flickr)

Last Monday, a call came in to BBC Television Centre, London, from the office of Mitt Romney's billionaire backer and “advisor” Paul Singer.

Singer, top donor to the Republican Senate Campaign Committee had a message for the news chiefs at the prestigious broadcaster:

“We have a file on Greg Palast.”

I bet they do.

The purpose of the Singer call was clear: to smear the reporter whose broadcasts from Africa for BBC Newsnight, The Guardian and Democracy Now! had identified Singer as a “Vulture,” a speculator profiteering from misery, mayhem, corruption and civil war.

Apparently, the Republican Presidential front-runner would prefer his sugar-daddies be known as “job creators,” not predators.

“Greg Palast, Vultures' Picnic: In Pursuit of Petroleum Pigs, Power Pirates, and High-Finance Carnivores” is yours with a minimum one-time donation of $35, or a monthly commitment of $10 or more to Truthout.

And the Vulture really, really, doesn't like his starring role in my new book, Vultures' Picnic. I bet he doesn't.

Is BBC going to let Palast continue to investigate? The Romney money man added an unsubtle threat, “Palast has been sued before.”

Neither BBC nor The Guardian are backing down, bless'm.

What is in the file Mitt's billionaire has on Greg Palast? I'll show it to you myself, right here, if you have a little patience.

But it's not what's in Singer's file on me that's important — it's what's in my file about him.

You need to know: BBC has identified Singer as the Number One donor of the Republican Party in New York. His fundraising, in coordination with the Koch Brothers through a strange little group of far-right billionaires, is the cash-locomotive of the GOP.

How Singer “The Vulture” got his feathers, got that money that fuels the Romney and Republican causes is not a minor matter. Romney and the whole crew from Newt to Cain are selling us the line that Occupy Wall Street has it all wrong: calling for taxing or controlling the One Percent is a misguided attack on “job creators.”

Indeed, one of Romney's demands is that I change the name of my book from Vultures' Picnic to Job-Creators' Picnic. [OK, I made that up.]

Let's begin with how Singer got his feathers.

I didn't give Singer the name “Vulture.” His own banker buddies did—with admiration in their voices. Like any vulture, he feasts when victims die. Literally. For example, Singer made a pile buying an asbestos company, Owens Corning, out of bankruptcy. Owens had knowingly allowed thousands of its workers to get deadly asbestosis, then concealed it. You don't want to die of asbestosis. Your lungs turn to mush and you drown inside yourself.

Singer, the Job Creator, used his political muscle to screw down the compensation workers would get. Offered them peanuts. And dying, they took it. With the asbestos workers buried or bought, the asbestos death factories were now worth a fortune …and Singer made his first “killing.”

Then it was on to Peru where Singer had, through a brilliant financial-legal maneuver too questionable for others to attempt, grabbed control of the entire financial system of Peru. Most important, he seized the President's jet. When the scamp of a President, Alberto Fujimori, decided it was a good idea to flee his country (ahead of his arrest on murder charges), Singer, Peru's lawyer told me, let Fujimori escape in return for the Murderer-in-Chief ordering Peru's treasury to pay Singer $58 million.

But that's nothing. What really sent Mitt's man up a wall was my report from the Congos (there are two nations in Africa called 'Congo') where there's a cholera epidemic due to lack of clean water. Singer paid we're told about $10 million for some “debt” supposedly incurred by the Republic of Congo. Congo would pay the $10 million, but Singer had begun seizing about $400 million in the poor nation's assets.

The former Deputy Secretary of the UN said about the vultures, “you are causing babies to die.”

It's legal, it's sick, it's Singer.

Well, not legal in most of the civilized world. Former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said about Singer and his fellow crew, “I deplore the activities of so-called Vulture Funds, [they] are nothing short of scandalous.” Britain has outlawed Singer's re-po man seizures (after all, it's ultimately the aid money we give Africa). In the UK, and in much of Europe, Singer is a finance outlaw. But in the USA, he's a “job creator.”

Look, I've only scratched the surface from BBC's four-year investigation of Singer who says he'll talk with us, “Never, ever.”",corrupt backer for a politician

NEW YORK, June 23 (Reuters) - A federal appeals court on Tuesday refused to overturn the fraud conviction of former Cendant Corp Chairman Walter Forbes for his role in one of corporate America’s largest accounting scandals.

The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York rejected Forbes’ argument that a new trial was warranted because newly discovered evidence from a former chief financial officer at CUC International Inc, a Cendant predecessor, might exonerate him.

Forbes’ earlier appeal of his October 2006 conviction was rejected by the U.S. Supreme Court in May 2008. The federal case had been prosecuted by U.S. Attorney Chris Christie of New Jersey, now that state’s governor.

Masha Hansford, a lawyer for Forbes, declined to comment. The U.S. Department of Justice did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Forbes, 72, was sentenced in January 2007 to 12 years, seven months in prison and ordered to pay $3.275 billion after jurors in Bridgeport, Connecticut, found him guilty of conspiracy and two counts of submitting false reports to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

Prosecutors accused the New Canaan, Connecticut, resident of masterminding a fraud that began at CUC, where he had been chairman and chief executive officer, and inflated earnings.

The fraud was discovered in 1998, wiping out $14 billion of market value in one day at Cendant, a travel and real estate services company. Its size was later surpassed by scandals at Enron Corp and WorldCom Inc.

In his latest appeal, Forbes sought to have former CUC Chief Financial Officer Stuart Bell rebut testimony from Cosmo Corigliano, his successor as CFO, about the fraud.

Bell had invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, but Forbes said he could now testify under immunity because the statute of limitations for the government to charge him had run out.

Circuit Judge Richard Wesley, however, wrote for a three-judge panel that the time lapse did not make Bell’s testimony newly discovered, given that Forbes “had to be aware” of its exculpatory nature during the trial.

The “mere passage of time” did not justify a new trial, Wesley wrote.

Cendant evolved into what is now Avis Budget Group Inc and in 2000 reached a $2.9 billion civil class action settlement with shareholders.

Forbes is not eligible for release until July 21, 2018.

TMML2024035820261,Vytautas Parfionovas,"Alert ID: TMML2024035820261
A criminal complaint was unsealed today in federal court in Brooklyn charging Lithuanian national Vytautas Parfionovas with computer intrusion, securities fraud, money laundering, bank fraud and wire fraud, among other offenses. The charged crimes stem from a variety of criminal conduct between 2011 and 2018 in which Parfionovas gained access to U.S.-based computers, including email servers and computers belonging to U.S. financial institutions, in order to steal money from online bank accounts and securities brokerage accounts. Parfinovas was arrested in Ukraine on October 24, 2019, and was extradited to the United States on November 21, 2019.

Richard P. Donoghue, United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, and William F. Sweeney, Jr., Assistant Director-in-Charge, Federal Bureau of Investigation, New York Field Office (FBI), announced the charges.

“As alleged, the defendant and his co-conspirators stole millions of dollars from U.S. victims while sitting behind keyboards thousands of miles away,” stated United States Attorney Donoghue. “Cybercriminals are hereby on notice that no amount of distance or subterfuge will protect them, and that we and our law enforcement partners are committed to unmasking, arresting and prosecuting them.” Mr. Donoghue thanked the Prosecutor Generals Office of Ukraine, the FBI Legal Attaché’s Office in Kiev, the Department of Justice’s Office of International Affairs and the National Cyber Forensic Training Alliance for their assistance in the investigation and the defendant’s extradition.

“The world has become a much smaller place with the advent of the internet, and with that shrinking globe, the days of cyber criminals thinking because they're not in our country they can escape justice are over,” stated FBI Assistant Director-in-Charge Sweeney. “Our extraordinary partnerships allow the FBI to reach into many of the dark corners where these thieves feel invincible. If you violate our laws, we will make sure you pay the price.”

As charged in the criminal complaint, starting in January 2011, Parfionovas and his co-conspirators engaged in a long-running scheme to steal money through a variety of computer intrusions.

In one part of the scheme, Parfionovas and his co-conspirators allegedly obtained login information for victims’ securities brokerage accounts through various methods, including stealing that information from the server of a U.S. securities order management company to which the conspirators gained unauthorized access. The conspirators then used those accounts to steal money and conduct trades to their own benefit. Initially, conspirators accessed the victim brokerage accounts and transferred money from those accounts to other accounts under their control. After financial institutions began to block those unauthorized transfers, Parfionovas and his co-conspirators accessed other victim brokerage accounts without authorization, and placed unauthorized stock trades within those accounts while simultaneously trading profitably in the same stocks from accounts that they controlled. On or about February 22, 2016, Parfionovas explained this aspect of the scheme to a co-conspirator as follows: “I take some fraud logins. Do some s[_]t with stock . . . sometimes 2-3 in day . . . manipulation is 100%.” In this manner, Parfionovas and his co-conspirators realized financial gains while causing losses of more than $5.5 million.

In another part of the scheme, Parfionovas and his co-conspirators allegedly obtained login information for victim email accounts and accessed those accounts without authorization. The conspirators then sent email messages from those accounts to the victims’ financial advisers and requested wire transfers from the victims’ financial institutions to overseas bank accounts that the conspirators controlled. For example, in or about May 2013, Parfionovas and his co-conspirators obtained $50,000 from an investment account that belonged to U.S. victims, and Parfionovas directed the transfer of those funds to a series of bank accounts and ultimately to an individual in Kharkov, Ukraine, where Parfionovas was located. To defraud another victim, Parfionovas and his co-conspirators obtained control over a victim’s email account and used it to send written instructions—which falsely appeared to have been signed by the victim—to transfer $225,000 from one of the victim’s accounts.

If convicted, the defendant faces up to 30 years’ imprisonment for the money laundering charge, and a mandatory consecutive two-year sentence for the charge of aggravated identity theft.

The charges in the complaint announced today are allegations, and the defendant is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.

The government’s case is being handled by the Office’s National Security and Cybercrime Section and the Business and Securities Fraud Section. Assistant United States Attorneys David K. Kessler, Mark E. Bini and Alexander Mindlin are in charge of the prosecution. The Justice Department’s Office of International Affairs of the Department’s Criminal Division provided significant assistance in securing the defendant’s extradition from Ukraine.

WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of the Treasury today designated drug launderer Pedro Claver Mejia Salazar (Mejia Salazar) and his narcotics money laundering network based in Medellín, Colombia pursuant to the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act (Kingpin Act). Treasury also designated Colombian national Fredy Alonso Mira Perez (alias Fredy Colas), an important underboss in the criminal organization known as La Oficina de Envigado, as well as 10 additional individuals, and 14 entities, all based in Colombia. As a result of today’s actions, all assets that are based in the United States or in control by U.S. persons in which the individuals and entities designated today have an interest in are frozen, and U.S. persons are generally prohibited from engaging in transactions with them.

Mejia Salazar, often acting under the authority and direction of Fredy Colas, primarily launders narcotics proceeds on behalf of La Oficina de Envigado, a group which Treasury designated pursuant to the Kingpin Act on June 26, 2014. As part of his global drug money laundering operations, Mejia Salazar and his network work closely with Lebanese-Colombian drug money launderer Ayman Saied Joumaa, also a Specially Designated Narcotics Trafficker.

“Operatives of La Oficina de Envigado have tapped into Ayman Joumaa’s international networks and successfully moved drug proceeds back to traffickers in Colombia from locations around the world, posing a major threat to U.S. interests,” said Director of Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control Director Adam Szubin. “Treasury will continue to aggressively expose and disrupt the activities of these illicit networks, wherever they may be operating.”

Mejia Salazar relies on a network of trusted family members to carry out his money laundering transactions, including his sons – Juan Carlos, Victor Gabriel, Andres Camilo, and Jose Alejandro Mejia Alzate – and his nephews – Jesus Rodolfo, Jose Albeiro, and Jose Guillermo Barco Mejia. Several entities designated today, which are owned by Mejia Salazar and his family, are also directly involved in these illicit transactions, including Grupo Empresarial Enkor Profesional S.A.S., a well-known beauty products company based in Medellín.

Today’s action was made possible by a lengthy investigation led by the Financial Investigations Team of the Drug Enforcement Administration’s (DEA) New England Field Division.

“The success of this investigation was a direct result of the hard work and dedication of the DEA New England Field Division’s Financial Investigation Team and our law enforcement partners,” said DEA Acting Special Agent in Charge Michael J. Ferguson. “The DEA New England Field Division is committed to targeting large-scale criminal organizations, using all our enforcement resources.”

Since June 2000, more than 1,600 individuals and entities have been named pursuant to the Kingpin Act for their role in international narcotics trafficking. Penalties for violations of the Kingpin Act range from civil penalties of up to $1.075 million per violation to more severe criminal penalties. Criminal penalties for corporate officers may include up to 30 years in prison and fines up to $5 million. Criminal fines for corporations may reach $10 million. Other individuals could face up to 10 years in prison and fines pursuant to Title 18 of the United States Code for criminal violations of the Kingpin Act.","sanctions, money laundering, narcotics"

Conspiracy Theories of the ‘White Genocide’

While much remains to be learned about the terrorist attack targeting worshipers at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, the 17,000-word manifesto posted online by the gunman makes it clear that far-right internet culture and white supremacist propaganda played an integral role in radicalising the 28 year-old attacker.

In his manifesto, the terrorist made frequent reference to the white genocide conspiracy theory, which claims – falsely – that white people are being replaced by non-whites through changes in birth rates, mass immigration and “forced assimilation”. According to the Anti-Defamation League, the belief system surrounding so-called ‘white genocide’ represents “one of the most deeply held white supremacist convictions”.

More than $200 million was pumped into the anti-Muslim propaganda industry between 2008 and 2013.

The manifesto is riddled with anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim rhetoric. Throughout the document, the terrorist repeatedly referred to Muslims as “invaders” who are trying to take over “the West” and lamented the “high fertility” rates among Muslim populations.

The gunman frequently returned to the conspiratorial idea that whites are facing an existential threat due to increasing numbers of Muslims and other immigrants coming to predominantly white countries and “destroying” the culture. The word “destroy” appears 25 times in the document, while references to “birth rate” and “fertility” appear 43 times, alongside 47 references to Western or European “culture”.

Such extremist views are common in the modern white supremacist movement. The terrorist’s manifesto mirrors the rhetoric found on forums and message boards such as 4chan and Stormfront, as well as websites like the Daily Stormer, VDARE, and Vanguard News Network.

Electing Trump was about White Supremacy Not ‘Making America Great Again’

CJ Werleman

But, the gunman’s Islamophobic rhetoric isn’t confined to the dark corners of the web. Far from it, actually.

Inciting hatred towards Muslims is part of a multi-million dollar propaganda business funded by some of the most prominent right-wing donors and organisations in the United States – including many that have direct ties to the Trump administration.

According to a June 2016 report released by the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) and University of California Berkeley’s Centre on Race and Gender, more than $200 million was pumped into the anti-Muslim propaganda industry between 2008 and 2013.

That money funded the activities of several dozen groups whose primary purpose is to “promote prejudice against, or hatred of, Islams and Muslims” and to push their Islamophobic rhetoric from the fringes into the mainstream.

They achieve that goal, in part, by working hand-in-hand with media and tech companies to disseminate their propaganda via right-wing “scholars”, media personalities, grassroots organisations and other associated entities.

“This enables them to mutually reference each other’s highly inaccurate or purposefully deceptive material as facts and then subsequently disseminate it to other grassroots groups and politicians through right-wing media outlets,” the Centre for American Progress (CAP) explained in a 2011 report.

Among the most prominent donors backing America’s anti-Muslim propaganda industry is Robert Mercer, whom the Washington Post named as one of the “top 10 most influential billionaires in politics”.

Mercer – the top contributor to Donald Trump’s presidential campaign – is affiliated with a slew of right-wing organisations, but he is perhaps most notorious for launching the now-defunct, scandal-plagued data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica and funding the far-right Breitbart News network, run by Steve Bannon.

Mercer, his daughter Rebekah, and the vehicles they use to influence policy and society, are a case study in for-profit hate, showcasing the inner workings of an anti-Muslim propaganda industry, the tentacles of which stretch from the fringes of the internet to establishment think tanks – and all the way into the White House.

The Mercer-Funded Anti-Muslim Propaganda Business

Between 2014 and 2016, the Mercer Family Foundation donated $250,000 to the New York-based Gatestone Institute, an anti-Muslim think tank that warns of a looming Muslim takeover of Europe leading to a “ Great White Death ”.

The organisation is also notable for its close ties to the Trump administration. Rebekah Mercer sits on its board of governors, former Trump campaign chairman Steve Bannon has been a speaker at Gatestone events, and Trump’s national security adviser John Bolton became the group’s chairman in 2013.

In 2016, the Gatestone Institute partnered with far-right Canadian website Rebel Media to produce a dozen “cross-branded videos” warning about the supposed dangers of Islam and refugees from Muslim-majority countries. The clips were posted on the Gatestone Institute’s YouTube page and cross-posted on Rebel Media ’s website between May and October 2016.

Rebel Media has produced a number of prominent anti-Muslim and anti-immigration activists, including Lauren Southern, Laura Loomer, Faith Goldy, Gavin McInnes, and ‘ Tommy Robinson ‘. These activists, along with ideologically aligned figures like Stefan Molyneux and Milo Yiannopoulos – whose activism on behalf of neo-Nazis and white nationalists was funded by Mercer dollars – form a global network of Islamophobia spanning the UK, US, Canada, Australia and South Africa, among others.

The video series produced by Rebel Media and Gatestone covered topics including Sweden’s migrant rape epidemic, the dangers of the Islamization of the West and the growing influence of Sharia law and the Islamization of Europe, which the video claimed was a threat to “Western values”.

Other videos asked if Europe is “ doomed by migrants ” and whether “ Europeans […] will rise to fight radical Islam and hold onto Western values ”. Some pushed fear-mongering disinformation about so-called “ no go zones ” and propaganda claiming that Islam is inherently linked to terrorism.

The New Zealand gunman referenced many of these topics in his manifesto and the underlying theme of Muslims as a threat to “Western culture” – whiteness – featured prominently in both the videos and the manifesto.

Notably, the list of speakers featured in the video series includes Dutch far-right leader Geert Wilders and Daniel Pipes, president of the Middle East Forum (MEF), which has been identified as one of five key think tanks fuelling the anti-Muslim propaganda industry.

Not coincidentally, many of the videos also feature clips of news articles from Breitbart, the far-right platform financed by Robert Mercer – just one of many examples of how this network of Mercer-affiliated, anti-Muslim organisations and individuals uses its own propaganda across platforms to make it appear more credible and to expand its reach.

Weaponised Islamophobia

The partnership between Rebel Media and the Mercer-backed Gatestone Institute demonstrates how the anti-Muslim propaganda industry pushes its Islamophobic messaging from seemingly “serious” think tanks and other conservative organisations to far-right websites and activists, who then recycle the talking points and disseminate them to new audiences.

Prominent tech companies such as YouTube, Google and Facebook play a major role in this cycle by disseminating extremist content to specific audiences through features like micro-targeting and algorithmically-produced recommendations and suggestions.

“We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of people’s profiles. And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons”

Chris Wylie

This was the case with Secure America Now, a secretive right-wing organisation bankrolled by Robert Mercer. In 2016, the dark money group produced a series of Islamophobic propaganda videos and aired them during the final weeks of the US presidential election.

However, most Americans never saw the fear-mongering videos – and that’s no accident. Secure America Now worked closely with Facebook and Google to target the anti-Muslim ads only at voters in swing states who were deemed most likely to be receptive to the messaging, which was “meant to stoke viewers’ fears of imminent Muslim conquest”.

This type of targeting falls squarely within the purview of Cambridge Analytica, the data firm funded by Robert Mercer.

Former Cambridge Analytica employee-turned-whistleblower Chris Wylie has described how the company, which shut down last year, used Facebook data to build a system that could profile individual voters to target them with political ads.

“We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of people’s profiles,” he said. “And built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons. That was the basis the entire company was built on.”

As journalist Carole Cadwalladr has explained in the Guardian, adware and tracking cookies from websites such as Breitbart can also be used by companies like Cambridge Analytica to track and monitor people’s online activity. This data can be mined to profile people based on their internet browsing history and, then, with Facebook’s help, target them with ads.

“With this, a computer can… predict and potentially control human behaviour,” Professor Jonathan Rust, Director of the Psychometrics Centre at the University of Cambridge told the Guardian. “It’s how you brainwash someone. It’s incredibly dangerous.”

“It’s no exaggeration to say that minds can be changed. Behaviour can be predicted and controlled. I find it incredibly scary. I really do. Because nobody has really followed through on the possible consequences of all this.”

Those consequences are coming to light in real time and, all too often, they come in the form of hate crimes and violence.

Zambia’s anti-corruption agency on Tuesday arrested a medical practitioner for issuing COVID-19 clearance certificates suspected to be fake .

The Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) said Kingsley Kakoma, a biomedical technologist at the Levy Mwanawasa University Teaching Hospital, was arrested for suspected corrupt practices in relation to the illegal issuance of travellers’ medical certification for COVID-19.

Timothy Moono, the anti-corruption agency’s Corporate Affairs Manager said the medical officer was arrested after a tip-off from members of the public and was found in possession of 2,250 Zambian Kwacha (about 110 U.S. dollars) and five blank COVID-19 clearance medical certificates.

He said in a statement that the certificates were pre-signed, marked negative and bore a stamp for the Zambia Institute of Public Health, the government agency authorized to issue COVID-19 certificates.

He was also found in possession of 86 preservation solution tubes, 50 sample collection swabs, among other items.

The suspect, he said, was arrested after soliciting for money from a student who was scheduled to travel abroad for studies.

The Ministry of Health warned recently that it was aware of some private health facilities that were issuing fake COVID-19 certificates at a fee.

Minister of Health Chitalu Chilufya said the trend poses risks to the health of people and warned of stern action to anyone who will be arrested.

Zambia has so far recorded 15,549 COVID-19 cases since March, including 14,682 recoveries and 345 deaths.",corruption for fake medical certificates

KANSAS CITY, Mo. – A Prairie Village, Kansas, man pleaded guilty in federal court today to engaging in two separate fraud schemes related to millions of dollars in false payday loan debt and to tax evasion totaling more than $8 million.

“This well-dressed thief victimized millions of Americans whose personal information was fraudulently sold to debt collectors,” Garrison said. “Some of those victims, in their fear and confusion, actually paid debts they didn’t owe. And by hiding his income and assets then lying about it to federal agents, he victimized every honest citizen who obeys the law and pays their income taxes. His thievery allowed him to enjoy a luxurious lifestyle for a short time, but he won’t be entitled to such luxuries in federal prison.”

“Today, Mr. Tucker admitted he evaded the payment of taxes assessed against him. Despite receiving millions of dollars, Mr. Tucker used such funds to sustain a lavish lifestyle and not fulfill his civic duty,” said Adam Steiner, Acting Special Agent in Charge of the St. Louis Field Office. “We are determined at the IRS and Department of Justice to halt tax evasion, and the facts outlined in today’s plea are strong indicators that we can and will find this fraudulent activity.”

Joel Jerome Tucker, 51, pleaded guilty before U.S. District Judge Roseann Ketchmark to one count of transporting stolen money across state lines, one count of bankruptcy fraud, and one count of tax evasion.

Tucker, working through various companies, serviced payday loan businesses. Tucker’s company names changed over the years; the primary company was eData Solutions, LLC. eData, formally registered on July 29, 2009, did not make loans directly to borrowers; it collected loan application information, referred to as leads, and sold those leads to its approximately 70 payday lender clients. As a loan servicer, eData also provided software for payday lenders.

Tucker and the other owners of eData sold the company to the Wyandotte Indian tribe in 2012. However, despite selling his interest in eData, Tucker maintained a file of 7.8 million leads he had acquired through eData, containing detailed customer information (including names, addresses, bank accounts, Social Security numbers, dates of birth, etc.). eData had collected the detailed customer information from online payday loan applications or inquiries to its payday lender clients; the file did not represent loans that were made. In addition, Tucker obtained and retained data regarding defaulted payday loans eData had acquired from a number of different payday lender clients. Tucker used these files to create falsified debt portfolios.

By pleading guilty today, Tucker admitted that he engaged in a fraudulent debt scheme from 2014 to 2016. This scheme involved marketing, distributing, and selling false debt portfolios. Tucker defrauded third party debt collectors and millions of individuals listed as debtors through the sale of falsified debt portfolios. Tucker sold supposed debts which: 1) he didn’t personally own; 2) were not true debts; 3) had already been sold to other buyers; and 4) contained false lenders, false loan dates, false loan amounts, and false payment status. Tucker received as much as $7.3 million from the sale of false debt portfolios.

As part of his fraud scheme, Tucker transferred the proceeds of the fraud scheme across state lines.

Tucker also admitted that he executed a related bankruptcy fraud scheme in 2015. In his bankruptcy fraud scheme, Tucker also sold fraudulent debt, which entered the United States Bankruptcy Courts nationwide. When the United States Bankruptcy Court investigated these purported debts which were presented as claims in bankruptcy cases, Tucker provided false information and testimony to the Bankruptcy Court in order to conceal his scheme.

For tax years 2014 - 2016, neither Tucker personally nor any of his companies filed federal tax returns with the Internal Revenue Service. Tucker told IRS agents that he had no income and was living on borrowed money, including a lot of borrowed money from his mother. In reality, Tucker used nominee bank accounts to conceal income and assets and spent hundreds of thousands of dollars in personal living expenses such as vehicles, chartered jets, travel and entertainment, and a personal residence. Tucker also submitted a form to the IRS in which he omitted listing as an asset his membership in the Vail Mountain Club, for which he received $275,000 in 2016.

Under the terms of today’s plea agreement, Tucker must pay $8,057,079.95 in restitution to the Internal Revenue Service. Tucker also must forfeit to the government $5,000, which is the amount of stolen proceeds transferred across state lines as referenced in the specific count to which he pleaded guilty.

Under federal statutes, Tucker is subject to a sentence of up to 20 years in federal prison without parole. The maximum statutory sentence is prescribed by Congress and is provided here for informational purposes, as the sentencing of the defendant will be determined by the court based on the advisory sentencing guidelines and other statutory factors. A sentencing hearing will be scheduled after the completion of a presentence investigation by the United States Probation Office.

TMML2024033941276,Scott Rowbotham,"Alert ID: TMML2024033941276
A fraudster who created a £10m property empire with the help of Tameside's criminal underworld has to pay back more than £3.5m or face more jail time.

Scott Rowbotham, 37, amassed a huge portfolio across Greater Manchester totalling 88 properties, with the assistance of criminals including convicted drug dealer Billy Black.

Under the Proceeds of Crime Act, Rowbotham has been ordered to pay back £3,522,459 within three months, or face 10 years in jail. The time period can be extended to six months if allowed.

That figure is the highest ever awarded by a court following a GMP financial investigation.

Rowbotham's property empire will now be sold off to recoup some of his ill-gotten gains.

It comes as solicitor Ross McKay, who helped Rowbotham achieve the huge fraud, was jailed for seven years after a jury unanimously found him guilty of three counts of money laundering.

Rowbotham, previously of Ashes Close, Stalybridge, was jailed for three years and eight months in May 2017 after admitting fraud and money laundering between 2004 and 2014.

He has now been released from prison.

Manchester Crown Court has heard that Rowbotham was able to persuade lenders to hand over huge cash sums by lying about his income and forging payslips.

He also exaggerated the value of houses he was buying, which cut out the need for deposits and in turn maximised his profits.

To fund more deals, Rowbotham let out and remortgaged existing properties, and falsified sales to friends and family to raise more cash.

He is said to have enjoyed a luxury lifestyle from the proceeds, despite earning only £1,000 in declared income and paying £18.20 in tax in an eleven-year period.

A sentencing hearing on Friday, prosecutor Nick Clarke QC said that McKay was Rowbotham's solicitor, carrying out conveyancing for their properties.

Police said McKay, a 39-year-old father-of-three, was their 'go to' lawyer, as he would not ask too many questions about their business or where the money was coming from.

Defending, Mark Rhind said that this marks the end of McKay's professional career, as he will be struck off.

McKay, originally from Dukinfield, studied law at Huddersfield University and qualified in 2004, the court heard.

Judge Timothy Smith said that McKay, of Sagars Road, Handforth, Cheshire, then acted fraudulently for a five year period, eventually being arrested in 2014.

Addressing him, the judge said: ""You were expected to be a person of utmost integrity and honesty.

""You fell far short of those high standards of professionalism, trust and integrity that are to be expected of a solicitor.

""You failed, as was your duty, to uphold the law and the proper administration of justice.

""By your actions, you enabled criminal property to be acquired on a significant scale, and chose to involve yourself in the activities of those involved in crime, organised crime and, in the case of Mr Black, drug dealing.""

After today's hearing, senior financial investigator Adrian Ladkin, of GMP’s Economic Crime Unit, said: ""McKay was fully aware that the purpose of the transactions was to launder criminal proceeds and he was deliberately dishonest in facilitating them.

""As a solicitor, McKay was in a position of trust, but he spectacularly failed in his legal duties through his corrupt and unlawful actions.

""It is thanks to the meticulous work of the officers in this case that today he has been brought to account for his deceitful actions.""

Black, now 48, was eventually jailed for 15 years after being was found guilty of fraud, drugs and money laundering offences.

He later had his sentence increased by seven years to a total of 22 years, after failing to pay off the £999,999 ordered following his Proceeds of Crime Act hearing.

Neil Bolton, a solicitor who fraudulently helped Black to build up his property portfolio, was also previously jailed for nine months.

The Proceeds of Crime Act, which came into force in 2013, allows police to go after the assets of criminals after they have been convicted.

HARARE - Former Zimbabwe finance minister Ignatius Chombo, who was among those detained by the military when they seized power before Robert Mugabe resigned, was charged with three counts of corruption in offences that took place more than a decade ago.

This was Chombo’s first public appearance since he was detained almost two weeks ago after the military launched “Operation Restore Legacy” which it said was meant to remove “criminals” around ousted president Mugabe.

Several members of a group allied to Mugabe and his wife Grace were detained and expelled from the ruling party, including Chombo, the ousted head of the influential Zanu-PF youth league Kudzanai Chipanga and a deposed leader in the party’s youth wing Innocent Hamandishe.

Some supporters of new President Emmerson Mnangagwa have been calling for unspecified action against the so-called G40 group that backed Mugabe and his wife. Chombo, Chipanga and Hamandishe were allied to the G40 group.

Before his inauguration, Mnangagwa on Thursday urged the country’s citizens not to undertake any form of “vengeful retribution”.

Chombo was charged with attempting to defraud the Zimbabwean central bank, among other offenses committed in 2004, the state prosecutor said.

Chombo was local government minister at the time.

He was not asked to enter a plea at this first court appearance and the state asked the court to remand him in custody of until his trial on 8 December. Chombo showed no emotion while the charges were read out.

Chombo’s lawyer, Lovemore Madhuku said on Friday Chombo was admitted to hospital with injuries sustained from beatings he received in military custody. Chombo had no visible injuries and appeared calm, chatting with the police guarding him when the court took a break. He was dressed in dark blue suit.

The police have said they had no information on Chombo when asked to comment.

A former University lecturer and Mugabe’s ally, Chombo was promoted in an October cabinet reshuffle from the interior ministry to the finance portfolio, against the backdrop of a severe hard currency shortage that has dealt a fresh blow to the southern African economy, which uses the US dollar.

Chipanga appeared at the court to face charges of making statements aimed at undermining public confidence in the defence forces. Hamandishe faced six counts of kidnapping and one of publishing falsehoods and was detained in custody until 8 December.

Mugabe’s fall after 37 years in power was triggered by a battle to succeed him that pitted Mnangagwa against Mugabe’s much younger wife Grace, who is 52.

Mnangagwa, 75, the former vice president sacked by Mugabe earlier this month, was sworn in as president on Friday after the 93-year-old former president who had led Zimbabwe from independence in 1980, stepped down on Tuesday after the army seized power and the ruling party turned against him.",corruption cases
TMML2024035233278,Martha Stewart,"Alert ID: TMML2024035233278
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
2003-69

-- The Securities and Exchange Commission today filed securities fraud charges against Martha Stewart and her former stockbroker, Peter Bacanovic. The complaint, filed in federal court in Manhattan, alleges that Stewart committed illegal insider trading when she sold stock in a biopharmaceutical company, ImClone Systems, Inc., on Dec. 27, 2001, after receiving an unlawful tip from Bacanovic, at the time a broker with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated. The Commission further alleges that Stewart and Bacanovic subsequently created an alibi for Stewart's ImClone sales and concealed important facts during SEC and criminal investigations into her trades. In a separate action, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York has obtained an indictment charging Stewart and Bacanovic criminally for their false statements concerning Stewart's ImClone trades.

The Commission seeks, among other relief, an order requiring Stewart and Bacanovic to disgorge the losses Stewart avoided through her unlawful trades, plus civil monetary penalties. The Commission also seeks an order barring Stewart from acting as a director of, and limiting her activities as an officer of, any public company. Stewart has been Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, Inc.

Stephen M. Cutler, the SEC's Director of Enforcement, said: ""It is fundamentally unfair for someone to have an edge on the market just because she has a stockbroker who is willing to break the rules and give her an illegal tip. It's worse still when the individual engaging in the insider trading is the Chairman and CEO of a public company.""

Wayne M. Carlin, Regional Director of the Commission's Northeast Regional Office, said: ""The Commission simply cannot allow corporate executives or industry professionals to profit illegally from their access to nonpublic information. The coordinated action announced today by the U.S. Attorney's Office shows that the consequences for those individuals will be even greater if we uncover evidence that they obstructed our investigation.""

Stewart's Dec. 27, 2001, ImClone sales came as ImClone and the market anxiously awaited an imminent decision from the Food and Drug Administration on one of ImClone's key products, a cancer treatment called ""Erbitux."" Bacanovic's unlawful inside tip was that other Bacanovic clients — ImClone's CEO, Samuel Waksal, and Waksal's daughter — had just placed orders to sell all the ImClone stock they held at Merrill Lynch. At the time, Waksal secretly knew that the FDA was about to reject ImClone's Erbitux application. Information about the Waksals' efforts to sell was confidential under Merrill Lynch policies, which prohibited employees from disclosing client transactions or effecting client trades on the basis of other client transactions. Had information about the Waksals' efforts to sell been known publicly, it would have signaled insider pessimism at ImClone about the FDA decision, the prospects for Erbitux, and the future of the company, according to the complaint.

The Commission alleges that, during the morning of Dec. 27, 2001, Bacanovic instructed his assistant, Douglas Faneuil, to tell Stewart that Waksal and his daughter were selling all the ImClone stock held in their Merrill Lynch accounts. During a subsequent telephone call, Faneuil conveyed that information to Stewart, who promptly instructed Faneuil to sell all 3,928 shares of her ImClone stock. The next day, Dec. 28, 2001, ImClone announced that the FDA had decided not to accept ImClone's Erbitux application for filing. By the close of the next trading day, Monday, Dec. 31, 2001, the price of ImClone stock dropped 16% to $46 per share. By selling when she did, Stewart avoided losses of $45,673.

The Commission alleges that Stewart and Bacanovic went on to lie when the Commission staff and criminal authorities questioned them about the facts surrounding Stewart's sale of ImClone stock. Stewart and Bacanovic fabricated an alibi for Stewart's trades, stating that she sold her ImClone stock because she and Bacanovic had decided earlier that she would sell if ImClone's stock price fell below $60 per share. In addition, Stewart told the government that she did not recall anyone telling her that day that any of the Waksals were selling their ImClone stock.

Pursuant to a separate Commission order issued this morning, the Commission has barred Faneuil from association with a broker, dealer, or investment adviser. The Commission acknowledges the assistance of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the investigation of this matter.

A businessman involved in a “highly sophisticated” boiler room scam has been jailed for seven years today.

Muhammad Tanveer was jailed for seven years on Friday, April 26 for his part in a boiler room scam which conned elderly people out of £3million. Picture: ERSOU

Muhammad Tanveer, of South Street, Romford was one of four men jailed for money laundering offences at Southwark Crown Court on Friday, April 26.

Tanveer, 30, was part of a group of eight who ran an elaborate scam from 2014 until 2016, conning more than 50 people out of £1.6million by convincing them to invest in fake companies.

In particular they would target elderly and often vulnerable individuals, with some people being scammed by the group more than once.

Judge Joanna Korner told the court: “The reason this fraud was particularly unpleasant was that part of it was aimed at many people who had already been defrauded.

“The frauds were highly sophisticated.”

A boiler room fraud sees criminals make cold calls or emails to people pretending to be from an established and legitimate company, persuading them to invest in what are in fact completely worthless or non-existent stocks. Often high pressured sales tactics are used, which is why they're described as boiler room.

The scam saw more than 50 people lose out to the con, with one victim, aged 83, losing just over £1m.

Another victim, who lost around £300,000, said in an impact statement to the police: “The financial loss has had a significant impact on my family and a longer term impact on not being able to provide for my family and children.”

Another told the police he couldn't sleep and had lost weight because of all the stress.

Judge Korner identified Tanveer as playing a leading role in the scam. He helped set up the companies used for the fraud, made arrangements for the websites and logos, and had direct contact with some of the investors.

Shaun Cross, 30, from Orpington was jailed for four years on Friday, April 26 for his part in a boiler room scam which conned elderly people out of £3million. Picture: ERSOU

“During the course of the evidence, [Tanveer] told lie after lie,” said judge Korner.

“Some of which were particularly outrageous. Even after being convicted in the first trial he declined to plead guilty.”

In addition to being jailed for a maximum of seven years, Tanveer was disqualified from acting as a director of a company for 10 years.

You may also want to watch:

Shaun Cross, 30, from Orpington, not only played a pivotal role in the scam but “heavily influenced” his cousin Lucy Richardson, 25, and his mother, Mandy Cross, 30, both also from Orpington, into setting up the fraudulent accounts.

He was jailed for four years and eight months and disqualified from acting as the director of a company for seven years.

Richardson was given a suspended sentence of two years for a two year period and ordered to do 200 hours of unpaid work and Mandy Cross, who used some of the money she gained from the scam to holiday in Mexico, was given a suspended sentence of 12 months for two years and ordered to complete 150 hours of unpaid work.

Barry Spearing, 58, from Suffolk, also played a key role in the scam. He had just been freed from prison for previous fraud convictions when he met Tanveer.

The court found that he was at high risk of reoffending and he was jailed for six years.

Ryan Weston, 27, from Wisbech, was jailed for a total of three years and six months after pleading guilty to money laundering at a trial on Monday, April 8.

Philip Hunt, 32, from Norfolk, pleaded guilty to money laundering at an earlier court date and was given a 20 months suspended sentence for two years, ordered to do 150 hours of unpaid work and disqualified from being a director of a company for five years.

Mark Bowman, 55, from Whitley Bay, was given a 15 months suspended sentence for two years and disqualified from acting as a director of a company for five years.

Judge Korner said: “These types of boiler room fraud are both pervasive, pernicious and mean and they produce large rewards for those who commit them.

“No one who reads or watches the media can fail to be aware that, notwithstanding the organisations set up by the police, only a tiny proportion of fraud receives investigations.

“I have no doubt that police resources are struggling. It's imperative that more time and resources are devoted not just to cyber crime but also these type of fraud of cases.”

Alistair Dickson, from the Crown Prosecution Service, added: “This was a particularly callous scam operation, where vulnerable victims lost their entire life savings on investments that simply didn't exist.

“Common to each of the frauds was the fact that the individuals targeted were often elderly and vulnerable.

“Persuaded by the friendly nature of those who contacted them and the lengths to which these criminals had gone to make it all seem genuine, they trusted what they were being told.

“The reality is that the gang conned their way to nearly £3m.”",fraud

Thomas J. Barrack Jr. is an American private equity real eestate investorand the founder and executive chairman of Colony Capital Inc. Barrack is a close friend and ally of President Donald Trump and has represented Trump on television news segments.

Barack is so close to President Trump that he even comfored him on his father’s funeral as some reports claimed at the time.

But when it comes to his country and it’s citizens the President shows no mercy.

Trump has reportedly cut off Tom Barrack over the inaugural fund investigation.

Via Politico:

The key issue driving the two men apart: Barrack’s role as chairman of the president’s 2017 inauguration fund, which is under investigation by prosecutors.

Trump was “really upset” to read reports about Barrack’s role in allegedly making it easy for some foreigners and others to try to spend money to get access to Trump and his inner circle and whether some of the inauguration money was misspent, according to a senior administration official.

“The president was really surprised to read all about the inauguration and who was trying to buy access and how, because the president doesn’t get any of that money,” said the official.

This is a really big deal. If the President’s close friend abused his position then Trump is right to be upset and cut ties.

Barrack decided to answer to these allegations:

But a spokesman for Barrack, Owen Blicksilver, pushed back on the notion that the two are no longer friendly.

“The relationship between Mr. Barrack and the president remains unchanged,” he said in a statement. “They have been friends for 40 years and Tom has great respect for President Trump and the incredibly daunting task of executing the job of president of the United States. Just as the president has worked 24/7 to lead the strongest economy in the last 50 years, Mr. Barrack also has a 24/7 responsibility leading a business he created 26 years ago.”

Maybe Tom Barack is guilty after all, but after the last 2-year spending spree, I don’t believe anything the press post about potential corruption. As far as I can tell the only corrupt entities are the Press, DNC, and the rest of the list of swamp creatures.

SALT LAKE CITY — A federal judge has frozen the assets of a Utah rare coin dealer after the Utah Department of Commerce and others accused the business and its owner of defrauding at least 200 people of more than $170 million since 2013.

A federal complaint was filed Thursday in Utah by the Securities and Exchange Commission against Rust Rare Coin, Inc. and owner Gaylen Dean Rust.

The Utah Department of Commerce says the company and Rust have defrauded customers in Utah and 16 other states, including receiving ""at least $42 million from investors in a pool that purportedly bought and sold silver,"" according to a press release issued Friday by the Commerce Department in conjunction with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and Division of Securities.

On Thursday, U.S. District Judge Tena Campbell issued a restraining order freezing the assets of Rust Rare Coin and allowing state and federal officials to ""inspect all relevant records,"" according to the statement.

The company is accused of tricking investors since 2008 into believing it was ""pooling investor money for the purpose of entering into contracts of sale for silver. … (Rust Rare Coin) told investors and prospective investors that they would sell silver held in the pool as market prices rose and buy silver for the pool as market prices fell; thereby increasing the amount of silver held in the 'Silver Pool,' as well as the value of each investor’s share in that pool,"" the statement said.

The Silver Pool, however, was a ""sham,"" according to the statement. Rust Rare Coin, however, ""generated extraordinarily high profits, averaging 20 to 25 percent per year and sometimes as high as 40 percent per year or more. The defendants provided investors with false account statements.""

“As alleged, for at least a decade, the defendants defrauded their friends, customers, and business associates out of more than $170 million. The defendants allegedly concealed their fraud with false account statements and Ponzi payments,"" Director of Enforcement James McDonald said in a prepared statement.

Rust Rare Coin ""misappropriated investor funds and used these funds to make payments to other investors in the manner of a Ponzi scheme, transfer money to other companies owned by Rust, and pay personal expenses,"" according to the statement.",details of fraud

| Bengaluru |

The CID Cybercrime Division of the Bengaluru City Police Thursday arrested four persons from Rajasthan who allegedly impersonated public figures, government officers, police officials on social media to transfer funds from friends and followers.

According to the police, the accused — identified as Ansar, Balvinder Singh, Saini, and Saddam — were arrested after the investigating team visited Bharatpur and other places in Rajasthan based on leads received during the probe.

In the past few months, the Cybercrime Division had registered at least four cases based on several incidents. “Over 10 such cases were filed in different police stations across Karnataka after which a team including K R Nagaraj (DSP, Cyber Crimes Division, CID), and Nayaz Ahmed (Police Inspector, CCD, CID) was formed to investigate the matter,” an officer from the Bengaluru Cybercrime Division told indianexpress.com.

Further, after collecting adequate evidence to record the arrests, the police explained the modus operandi saying that the accused were found to have collected photographs and other personal and professional information of genuine people to create fake social media profiles in their names.

“In the guise of such profiles, they first send friend requests to people who are already there on the friends’ list. Upon acceptance of friend request, they induce the persons to transfer money to various e-wallets and payment bank accounts citing some urgent need, thereby cheating them,” the officer explained.

The investigation also revealed that the accused worked as a team to apply for the activation of thousands of fake SIM cards using fake Aadhaar cards created by mixing up different photographs, addresses, and Aadhar numbers.

The probe team said the accused Saini created fake Aadhar cards which were handed over to Ansar, who worked as a retailer and uploaded them for SIM card activation. Balvinder worked as a SIM distributor who activated the same bypassing standard processes of verification, while Saddam used to receive all the money sent to the accounts created.

“In addition to impersonating people on Facebook, the accused persons used such fake SIM cards to open accounts on Twitter and Instagram as well to advertise on online re-selling platforms (OLX, Quikr), to open e-wallets/payment bank accounts like PayTM, Airtel Money, Google Pay, PhonePe, etc. in order to commit various cyber and online financial crimes across the country,” the team added.

Another accused, identified as Shakeel, who created fake social media profiles is still absconding and the search for him is underway, the police added.

A ""serial predatory fraudster"" pretended to be a police officer and solicitor to con domestic abuse victims, a court has heard.

Stephen Davey, 49, was jailed for four years for four fraud offences and a charge of theft at Liverpool Crown Court on Thursday.

Judge Robert Warnock said: ""He is a serial predatory fraudster, over a long period of time, throughout the country, targeting females.""

Sentencing Davey, he said: ""The time has come for you to stop committing fraud and causing so much harm to others.""

Davey, who has previously committed 57 fraud offences and 33 theft-related offences, has been described as ""one of Britain's most heartless love rats"" in tabloid newspapers in the past.

The court heard he contacted his two most recent victims, who cannot be named for legal reasons, through a woman who he met in a Liverpool bar.

He told the woman his name was Stephen Burns and he was a police officer and probation officer.

Nardeen Nemat, prosecuting, said the woman asked him to help her friends, who were both going through family court proceedings following abusive relationships, and he offered to put them in touch with a solicitor named Simon Davey, who did not exist.

The court heard one victim lost about £8,000 to Davey.

As well as paying him false legal fees, she paid for items including a television and PlayStation and gave him more than £400 for private health scans after he claimed he feared he had bowel cancer.

The other victim spent about £400 on legal fees.

Both victims, from Warrington, Cheshire, communicated with the bogus solicitor over email and were told by him not to attend family court hearings, Ms Nemat said.

In a statement read to the court, one victim said she felt Davey had portrayed her in a bad light to the family court, social services and her children's school.

The second victim, whose ex-partner had threatened to kidnap their child, said she felt she had been portrayed as ""unco-operative"" in the family court because Davey told her not to attend hearings.

She said: ""I cannot understand why he would put innocent children in danger and affect our lives so much.""

The court heard Davey sent fraudulent emails claiming to be from Warrington Borough Council and one from Merseyside Police Chief Constable Andy Cooke to back up his stories.

Tom Watson, defending, said Davey, originally of Wandsworth in London, accepted the victims had suffered and was remorseful.

He said because of his past offending ""the internet follows him around"".

In an email shown to the court, the defendant's mother said: ""He works hard and keeps trying to get on with his life but can't and I think it's unfair that he's unable to move on.""

Mr Watson said Davey was studying for a degree in criminology and psychology and had been volunteering with the probation service following his release from an earlier prison sentence in 2017, but was recalled to prison for 28 days in November last year.

Detective Constable Laura Gilbert said: ""Stephen Davey is a manipulative and despicable individual who has knowingly preyed on extremely vulnerable victims.

""He is a career criminal whose only motivation throughout was to extort as much money as he could from his victims.""

Davey pleaded guilty to two counts of fraud by false representation, making articles for use in fraud, possessing articles to use in fraud and theft.",fraud

Tampa, FL – U.S. District Judge James S. Moody, Jr. has sentenced Howayda Hamdan to seven years and six months in federal prison for engaging in a conspiracy to commit wire fraud and aggravated identity theft. As part of her sentence, the court also entered a money judgment in the amount of $1,168,858.11, the proceeds of the conspiracy. Hamdan pleaded guilty on August 21, 2014.

According to court documents, from January 2011 to April 20, 2011, while working as a personal banker for Regions Bank, Hamdan opened 292 bank accounts using 146 stolen identities. These accounts were opened for the sole purpose of laundering fraudulently obtained federal income tax refund checks that were acquired using the stolen identities of another 219 unknowing victims.

Hamdan’s co-conspirators, Riad Sulaiman, Nedal Ahmad, and Khaldoun Khalil Khawaja, owned and operated businesses where they knowingly negotiated fraudulently obtained tax refund checks. The co-conspirators brought the fraudulently obtained Treasury checks to Hamdan so they could be deposited and the proceeds withdrawn. Many of these checks were issued in the names of deceased individuals.

Hamdan needed means of identification, including names and Social Security numbers, to open the accounts at Regions Bank. Co-conspirator Dana Brown, a police officer, provided printouts from DAVID, Florida’s driver’s license database. The printouts contained the personally identifiable information (PII) required to open the bogus bank accounts. Since the victims of the tax filing scheme were often deceased, lived outside Florida, and/or were unknown to Hamdan and her co-conspirators, the stolen identities used to open the bank accounts were different, although similar in name, than the stolen identities used by the tax filers to obtain the tax refunds.

Once Hamdan deposited the fraudulently obtained Treasury checks, she facilitated the distribution of the proceeds to her co-conspirators, including her husband, Hicham El Faoutih. In May 2011, agents searched Hamdan’s residence. Among other things, they recovered $81,460.00 in cash (still inside a Regions Bank bag and wrapped with bank wrappers); three fraudulently obtained Treasury checks; a ledger containing hundreds of names and Social Security numbers; and stolen identities that had been provided by Brown.

In total, Hamdan facilitated the deposit or receipt of $1,168,858.11 in fraudulently obtained tax refunds. The government has also identified more than 400 victims whose identities were stolen during the course of Hamdan’s activities.

The co-conspirators in this case were previously prosecuted and sentenced. In July 2014, Hicham El Faoutih was sentenced to 15 months in federal prison. Nedal Ahmad was sentenced to 51 months in federal prison in June 2013. In June 2012, Ocala Police officer Dana Brown was sentenced to six years and five months in federal prison. In December 2011, Riad Sulaiman was sentenced in the Southern District of Florida to 41 months in federal prison. In August 2013, Khaldoun Khalil Khawaja was sentenced in the Western District of Virginia to 70 months in federal prison; this sentence is being served concurrent to a 37-month sentence imposed in April 2012 in the Middle District of Florida case.

This case was investigated by the United States Secret Service, the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation Division, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Pasco County Sheriff’s Office. It was prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorney Mandy Riedel.",

A money launderer who stashed £630,000 in supermarket and sports bags at his home in Kent has been jailed.

The cash was hidden in 12 bags along with an Encrochat encrypted phone and a cash-counting machine.

A number of high-value items including motorcycles, designer clothes and expensive fishing equipment were also seized from Karl Lockey's home.

The 32-year-old, of Sinclair Way in Dartford, was handed a two-year prison term by Woolwich Crown Court.

Lockey was arrested in June as part of Operation Venetic, a nationwide investigation tackling communication devices used by criminals across the world.

Messages on the Encrochat system had indicated Lockey was involved with money laundering, including conversations arranging meetings with secret verbal passwords, discussions and pictures of the hoarded cash.

The multi-millionaire owner of the Nina Ricci fashion company was today sent to prison for trying to hide her fortune from the French taxman through HSBC bank.

Arlette Ricci, 74 and one of the richest women in Europe, was ‘particularly determined’ to stash money in Swiss accounts for more than two decades.

A judgement handed down by a Paris criminal court added: ‘The seriousness of the facts are an exceptional threat to the public good.’

Ricci had denied hiding the equivalent of more than £15million, saying she had simply tried to avoid tax – which is legal – rather than evade it, which is not.

However, bugged phone conversations between the heiress and her daughter, Margot Vignat, suggested otherwise. According to the transcript, Ms Ricci boasted that she changed banks to escape prosecution and spent the hidden funds on buying a chalet in an upmarket Swiss ski resort.

‘I was never troubled. So I bought a chalet in Klosters, and now it’s fine. There was 2009, 2010, 2011 – it’s been three years so I think I’m free of any type of inspection,’ Ricci was heard to say.

Her daughter was heard warning her about the tax authorities, saying: 'Watch out all the same. They're vicious.'

But Ricci reassured her, saying: 'Everyone got done but not me. They had to give themselves in and pay a fortune.'

The daughter replied: 'Oh, that could cause some damage'. Ricci, in turn, said: 'Yes, of course, because all that is very illegal.'

In what will set a legal precedent for other cases of tax fraud through HSBC, Ricci was also fined the equivalent of more than £700,000.

Judges also ordered that houses in Paris and on the holiday island of Corsica worth more than £3m be seized.

Ricci was accused of transferring the deeds of the properties to family trusts in an attempt to restructure her assets, so as to evade penalties.

She was given a total of three years in prison, with two years suspended. Her daughter, 51, was also convicted and given an eight-month suspended sentence.

Henri-Nicolas Fleurance, Ricci’s tax adviser, was given a one-year suspended prison sentence and an £8000 fine for attempting to organise her insolvency.

Jean-Marc Fedida, one of the defence barristers, said 'justice was done under frenetic, brutal pressure', so as to use a high-profile defendant as a 'warning to all those' with offshore accounts.

But he conceded the sentence was 'much lighter' that what the prosecution had asked for.

Ricci, who had faced a maximum prison sentence of 10 years, may ask if she can serve the prison term under less strict conditions, including wearing an electronic tag, her lawyers said.

Her lawyers always argued the fault lay with HSBC in Switzerland, with one insisting in defence documents: 'She was in no way informed about how HSBC decided to structure the organisation of the funds she entrusted it with.'

They added that they were considering an appeal against sentence. Ricci was the first of more than 50 high-profile French nationals being pursued in the courts for using Swiss accounts to hide their money.

The judgment came after HSBC Holdings was formally placed under criminal investigation for complicity in fiscal fraud and illegal selling via its Swiss arm for two years starting in 2006.

Nina Ricci – real name Maria Adelaide Nielli – was an Italian-born clothes designer who settled in France aged 12 in 1895. She died in 1970.

Her son Robert, Arlette Ricci’s father, developed the company’s perfume sideline and raised the firm’s international profile. Arlette Ricci inherited his fortune on his death in 1988.",jailed for tax evasion

Tech titan John McAfee has been indicted for tax evasion and willful failure to file tax returns, according to charges announced by the Department of Justice Wednesday.

The June 15 indictment was unsealed following McAfee’s arrest in Spain where he is pending extradition.

According to the indictment, McAfee allegedly earned millions from promoting cryptocurrencies, consulting work, speaking engagements, and selling the rights to his life story for a documentary.

From 2014 to 2018, McAfee allegedly failed to file tax returns, despite receiving considerable income from these sources. The indictment does not allege that during these years McAfee received any income or had any connection with the anti-virus company bearing his name which was sold to Intel in 2011.

The tech titan is no stranger to run-ins with the law, Last July he was arrested -- and eventually released -- by the Dominican Republic Armed Forces in Puerto Plata following tweets with pictures of him on his boat with high-caliber weapons.

In 2012, he was arrested in Guatemala for illegally crossing the border from Belize to Guatemala in an attempt to find asylum from police in Belize. The software legend was under investigation in connection to the shooting death of a neighbor.

His Twitter feed is filled with colorful posts.

McAfee allegedly evaded his tax liability by directing his income to be paid into bank accounts and cryptocurrency exchange accounts in the names of nominees.

The indictment also alleges McAfee attempted to evade the IRS by concealing assets, including real property, a vehicle, and a yacht, in the names of others.

If convicted, McAfee faces up to five years in prison on each count of tax evasion and up to one year in prison on each count of willful failure to file a tax return. McAfee also faces a period of supervised release, restitution, and monetary penalties.

McAfee had hoped to make a presidential bid this year. He announced his White House plans to seek the Libertarian Party nomination in 2018. However, this past March he suddenly endorsed Libertarian candidate Vermin Supreme and said he would seek the second spot on the party's ticket, which he did not receive.",indcited for tax evasion

A federal grand jury in San Francisco, California, returned a 39 count indictment charging Robert T. Brockman, the Chief Executive Officer of an Ohio-based software company, with tax evasion, wire fraud, money laundering, and other offenses, announced Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Richard E. Zuckerman of the Tax Division, U.S. Attorney David L. Anderson for the Northern District of California, and Chief of Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Criminal Investigation Jim Lee. The charges stem from an alleged decades-long scheme to conceal approximately $2 billion in income from the IRS as well as a scheme to defraud investors in the software company’s debt securities.

“Today’s indictment reflects the Department of Justice’s commitment to finding and prosecuting the costliest and most sophisticated tax crimes in the United States,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General of the Tax Division Richard E. Zuckerman.

“Complexity will not hide crime from law enforcement,” said U.S. Attorney Anderson. “Sophistication is not a defense to federal criminal charges. We will not hesitate to prosecute the smartest guys in the room.”

“As alleged, Mr. Brockman is responsible for carrying out an approximately two billion dollar tax evasion scheme,” said Jim Lee, Chief of IRS Criminal Investigation. “IRS Criminal Investigation aggressively pursues tax cheats domestically and abroad. No scheme is too complex or sophisticated for our investigators. Those hiding income or assets offshore are encouraged to come forward and voluntarily disclose their holdings.”

According to the indictment, Brockman, a resident of Houston, Texas, and Pitkin County, Colorado, used a web of offshore entities based in Bermuda and Nevis to hide from the IRS income earned on his investments in private equity funds which were managed by a San Francisco-based investment firm. As part of the alleged scheme, Brockman directed untaxed capital gains income to secret bank accounts in Bermuda and Switzerland. The indictment further alleges that to execute the fraud, between 1999 and 2019, Brockman took measures such as backdating records and using encrypted communications and code words to communicate with a co-conspirator, among other alleged actions.

In addition to the tax offenses, the indictment alleges that, between 2008 and 2010, Brockman engaged in a fraudulent scheme to obtain approximately $67.8 million in the software company’s debt securities. As CEO, Brockman was contractually restricted from purchasing any of the software company’s debt securities without prior notice, full disclosure, and amending the associated credit agreements. The indictment alleges that Brockman used a third-party to circumvent those requirements, to acquire the debt securities, and to conceal from the sellers valuable economic information. The indictment further alleges that Brockman used material, non-public information about the software company to make decisions about purchasing the debt. In addition, Brockman allegedly persuaded another individual to alter, destroy, and mutilate documents and computer evidence with the intent to impair the use of such evidence in a grand jury investigation.

Brockman is charged with conspiracy, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371; seven counts of tax evasion, in violation of 26 U.S.C. § 7201; six counts of failing to file foreign bank account reports, in violation of 31 U.S.C. §§ 5314 & 5322(b); 20 counts of wire fraud affecting a financial institution, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1343; two counts of concealment money laundering, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1956(a)(1)(B)(i)), and tax evasion money laundering, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1956(a)(1)(A)(ii)); and one count each of international concealment money laundering, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1956(a)(2)(B)(i)); evidence tampering, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1512(b)(2)(B), and destruction of evidence, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1512(c)(1).

An indictment merely alleges that crimes have been committed. The defendant is presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. If convicted, Brockman potentially faces a substantial period of incarceration, as well as restitution and criminal forfeiture. Any sentence following conviction would be imposed by the court only after consideration of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and the federal statute governing the imposition of a sentence, 18 U.S.C. § 3553.

Brockman is scheduled to make his initial federal court appearance before U.S. Magistrate Judge Nathanael M. Cousins today.

The case is being prosecuted by Senior Litigation Counsel Corey Smith of the Tax Division, Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael G. Pitman, and Trial Attorneys Lee Langston and Christopher Magnani of the Tax Division.

A comprehensive dossier exposes Zanu PF Shamva North MP, Nicholas Tasunungurwa Goche, as having led violent and murderous campaigns in his constituency that led to the deaths of dozens of opposition activists and serious injury to hundreds.

The transport minister’s trail of brutality “stretches as far back as the 2000 parliamentary elections when scores of perceived opposition activists were butchered in and around the Shamva Gold mine areas.” Goche and his gangs used so-called ‘pungwe’ (re-education) sessions to carry out these attacks.

After MDC-T leader Morgan Tsvangirai won the March 2008 presidential election the Joint Operations Command (JOC), a grouping of all the state security agencies, responded with the brutal Operation Mavhotera Papi (where did you vote).

The figures are hard to confirm but its estimated nearly 500 perceived MDC-T supporters were killed, while tens of thousands were tortured and maimed. Goche meanwhile was busy playing his part in Shamva.

On the 11th May 2008 his mob descended on Elias Kahari Madzivanzira’s homestead. “They accused the family of being MDC supporters and they started randomly beating up everyone in sight and destroying whatever they could lay their hands on,” witness statements in the dossier say.

Elias was struck on the head with an axe and witnesses said his head split in two and he died on the spot. His wife Erica was also beaten up but survived. The perpetrators are well known in the local resettlement area and were seen in the company of Goche during the day, drinking beer and singing Mugabe’s praises.

Five days later on the 16th of May Goche addressed a campaign meeting at Chidembo School in the morning where he instructed all youths in the area to “guard their land jealously” against what he called “the whites re-invasion.” He told them to wipe out all MDC supporters in the area.

In his speech that day Goche mentioned Edson Zaya as a “known sell out in the area” and the mob captured him at Chidembo Shopping centre in Shamva. Zaya was heavily assaulted for more than an hour and was badly injured. He died shortly after the assault on the same day.

On the 27th of May Goche’s gang of ZANU PF youths dragged Kidwell Zvavamwe from his bed during the night. They assaulted him badly and he died from the injuries a week later. Kidwell’s wife Lucia Mukaru said that the youths barred her husband from seeking medical help.

In other incidents the youths;

“Dragged Roy Barwa from his hut with a wire tied around his neck like a leash and his face covered with a red cloth, which they said represented death. They destroyed his homestead burning all what was inside the huts. His entire family was assaulted, including the children and the mother.”

The mob was also responsible for the abduction of Florence Muponya from her home. They also beat up her husband before burning all the huts, kraals and a car. Showing the impunity with which Goche and his gang operated, the incident was reported to the police but Goche ordered the police to arrest his victims instead.

Muponya and her family were made to face political violence charges before the court in Bindura. The charges were subsequently thrown out.

It is remarkable given this background that Goche is one of ZANU PF’s key negotiators of the Global Political agreement (GPA), and in fact he was part of the team that crafted the GPA that shaped the coalition government.

In March this year, Goche was in the news when High Court Judge, Justice Charles Hungwe granted the Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission permission to search his ministerial offices and those of Mines minister Obert Mpofu and Indigenisation minister Saviour Kasukuwere.

The commission also pounced on the National Indigenisation and Economic Empowerment Board (NIEEB) and Zimbabwe National Road Administration (Zinara) offices which fall under Kasukuwere and Goche respectively. It was only Justice George Chiweshe who blocked the searches.

Chiweshe is a key Mugabe ally who as past chairman of the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission withheld presidential election results for weeks in March 2008, amid reports the period was used to manipulate and massage the figures that denied Morgan Tsvangirai an outright victory over a shocked Mugabe.",lead murderous campaings

When at the end of May French prosecutors filed preliminary charges against Qatari businessman Yousef al-Obaidly in connection with suspected bribery, the quake rippled all the way to the United Nations headquarters in New York.

Al-Obaidly, chief executive of BeIN Media, was charged in connection with suspected bribery so that his country would be successful in its bid to host the track and field world championships and the 2020 Olympic Games. French newspaper Le Monde reported in November 2016 that a former International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) official received two payments totaling around $3.5M from Qatari investors before the vote for the 2017 world championships host nation.

According to the Guardian, ""disgraced IAAF marketing consultant Papa Massata Diack discussed a transfer of money in emails to an account run by Sheikh Khalid bin Khalifa Al-Thani, just before the $3.5M payments were made. Al-Thani is a member of the royal family and chief of staff to Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, who was then the crown prince and heir to the throne and became the emir of Qatar in 2013.""

The payments were made by Oryx Qatar Sports Investments. Al-Obaidly's media company profited substantially from broadcasting and licensing rights, because BeIN Media is closely linked to the fund. The IAAF Championships were eventually awarded to London, but the ongoing investigations highlight Qatar's flagrant disregard for international law and its use of government-sanctioned bribery.

Even Qatar's own anti-corruption unit appears to be corrupt.

The chairman of the board of trustees of the Qatar-based ""Rule of Law and Anti-Corruption Center"" (ROLACC), Ali Bin Fetais Al Marri, who is also the country's attorney general, owns several properties that are substantially outside what a civil servant in Qatar would be able to afford. On a salary of a maximum of $12,000 per month, Al Marri has been able to purchase a €9.6M ($10.6M) mansion in Paris, close to the Arc de Triomphe, a CHF7M ($7.1M) villa in Cologny, Geneva's most expensive neighborhood, and an office in Geneva for CHF3.69M ($3.74M), which Al Marri rents out to the ROLACC dependence in the Swiss city.

How the ROLACC founder — and apparently chief corruption-fighter in Qatar — has been able to profit privately from letting his Geneva property to his anti-corruption agency is unclear. The office at Route de Ferney 221 was purchased in November 2015 through GSG Immobilier SA, of which Al Marri holds 99%.

ROLACC and Al Marri are of international significance, and it risks making a mockery of the U.S.-backed United Nations. Indeed, ROLACC signed an agreement on fighting corruption in sports with the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) in January this year — two months before the charges against Yousef al-Obaidly were first made by the French courts.

In 2017, the U.S. was the second main funder of the UNODC. American taxpayers should not be subsidizing unaccountable international civil servants who sign partnerships with dodgy organizations. In particular, the U.S. delegation to the U.N. should use its significant power to reform the UNODC. Congress should also revise its financial support to the UNODC in the face of state-sponsored corruption in Qatar.","corruption,bribe"

Former Zimra revenue officer Mr Kennedy Nyatoti has made history by becoming the first person to lose assets under Zimbabwe’s civil-based asset forfeiture law when his US$150 000 mansion and US$10 000 car were forfeited to the State after he and his divorced wife failed to explain how they could afford these.

Mr Nyatoti’s lawful income between October 2014 and May 2018 was US$44 907, and it was established that he neither had private income nor was he running a private business.

So he failed to explain how he managed to build the US$150 000 mansion in Mabvazuva suburb in Harare and buy a Honda CRV valued at US$10 000.

Zimra’s lifestyle audit team discovered the mansion and car, after perusing the claims made during the divorce proceedings between Mr Nyatoti and his wife.

Investigations established Mr Nyatoti never ran a legitimate business during the period in question, neither did he prove any payment of income tax regarding the funds needed to build the house.

A court application was made for civil forfeiture in terms of the amended Money Laundering and Proceeds of Crime Act and the High Court ordered forfeiture of the mansion and the car.

Previously, the State could only apply for forfeiture after a conviction for a corruption-related offence.

However, the new law now allows the State to apply for forfeiture under civil rules even without instituting criminal proceedings.

The main difference is that in civil cases a party only has to make a case on the balance of probabilities, but in a criminal case the rule is proof beyond reasonable doubt. So even if corruption was probable, but not proved, under the old rules the person kept the assets. Under the new law they can lose these.

If one fails to justify his or her wealth as required by law, the State can successfully forfeit the unexplained wealth.

Prosecutor General Mr Kumbirai Hodzi hailed the court’s decision saying processes were now underway to transfer ownership of the house and the car to the State.

Mr Hodzi said the new civil forfeiture law was a more effective in recovering funds lost through corruption or fraud.

Mr Nyatoti’s woes mounted when he parted ways with his wife. The divorce proceedings exposed Mr Nyatoti as someone living an expensive lifestyle well beyond his earnings.

Both Mr Nyatoti and his wife, Ms Tatenda Chisadza, were taken to court after failing to explain how they managed to build the property in Harare’s Mabvazuva suburb when his earnings during the period under review only amounted to US$44 900.

Investigations by Zimra also revealed that besides constructing a luxurious house, Mr Nyatoti allegedly paid lobola amounting to US$10 000 in 2016 before taking his family on a trip to China at a cost of US$15 000 in November 2017.

Principal Public Prosecutor Mr Kelvin Mufute said he was satisfied that the couple’s identified property constitutes proceeds of crime and was, therefore, tainted.

Mr Mufute further said Mr Nyatoti acquired a Honda CRV valued at US$6 000 which he registered under Ms Chisadza’s name, a Nissan Skyline valued at US$4 000 for his sister, built a house worth US$150 000 in Mabvazuva, Harare, and bought a Honda Fit registered under his mother’s name.

The court agreed that the assets could not have been acquired under the known income of the couple.

Buttressing the State’s case, Zimra’s loss control officer Mr Blessing Majoni submitted that his investigations had established that Nyatoti abused his office and obtained the funds through corrupt means, adding he even tried to hide behind his sister, Portia, in a bid to justify how he acquired his wealth.

But Portia could not have had the money either. Mr Majoni said Nyatoti lied about the amounts spent on vehicle imports, which was later verified by Zimra.",corruption

John Kapoor, the founder and former chief executive officer of Insys Therapeutics, has been sentenced to more than five years in federal prison for the role his company played in the opioid epidemic. Kapoor is the highest-ranking pharmaceutical executive to be held liable for the increasing opioid crisis.

Kapoor was found guilty in May 2019 of orchestrating kickback schemes to encourage doctors to boost prescriptions of Subsys, a powerful pain killer. For his role in that plan, Kapoor was sentenced to 66 months in prison Thursday afternoon. Prosecutors had hoped Kapoor, 76, would receive about 15 years in prison but Kapoor’s defense team had requested only one year in prison due to Kapoor’s advanced age. When U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs announced the sentencing, she said she arrived at the 66 months sentence due to Kapoor's advanced age and philanthropy, as well as ""his central role in the crime,” NPR reported, citing The Associated Press.

During the sentencing, several patients spoke about the suffering they went through after being prescribed high doses of Subsys from the doctors who were paid by Insys, the AP said. Some of the patients said the drug made their teeth fall out and also left them with memory loss. There were also stories of becoming addicted to opioids due to the doctors pushing the drug on them. One woman, Deborah Fuller, told the court about her daughter who died of an overdose at the age of 32, the AP said.

Kapoor offered an apology at the sentencing. He said he was “ heartbroken by the words of the patients” who spoke at both the sentencing and his trial.

U.S. Attorney Andrew Lelling told reporters following the sentencing that he objected to the lesser sentence.

“My view is that the public interest demanded higher sentences for these defendants,” Lelling said, according to the AP. “These guys basically took a publicly traded pharma company and turned it into an engine for corrupting doctors and jeopardizing the health of men and women nationwide.”

Kapoor’s sentencing comes days after his colleague, Michael J. Gurry, the former Vice President of Managed Markets, was sentenced to 33 months for his role in the Subsys scheme. Kapoor, Gurry and other Insys executives, including Richard M. Simon, the former National Director of Sales; Sunrise Lee, a former Regional Sales Director; and Joseph A. Rowan, a former Regional Sales Director; were found guilty of violating the RICO Act, for their role in the kickback schemes to boost prescriptions of Subsys, which was approved to treat the pain many cancer patients exhibit. On Thursday, Burlakoff was sentenced to 26 months in prison for his role, NPR reported.

During the trials, the government showed that Kapoor and his sales team used data to identify practitioners who either prescribed unusually high volumes of rapid-onset opioids or had demonstrated a capacity to do so. Once they were identified, the sales team went to work to increase the number of new Subsys prescriptions, and to increase the dosage and number of units of Subsys, the government said. The kickbacks were often noted as “speaker fees.” Additionally, the Insys team conspired to defraud health insurance providers who were reluctant to approve payment for the drug when it was prescribed for non-cancer patients, the government said. Prosecutors said Insys misled insurers regarding the true diagnosis of a patient in order to get approval for Subsys, which was to be prescribed to cancer patients.

Throughout the trial, sordid details of the methods used to persuade the prescribers were brought to light, including having an Insys sales manager perform a lap dance at a Chicago strip club for a doctor the company was trying to woo. Jurors were also introduced to a video from a 2015 sales conference of sales associates dancing with a giant bottle of the addictive fentanyl-based Subsys in a rap music video.

Henry T. Nicholas III, the billionaire co-founder of Broadcom, and a friend are taking a plea deal sparing them prison time in a Las Vegas Strip hotel room drug case, their lawyers and a prosecutor told a judge this week.

Nicholas and co-defendant Ashley Christine Fargo, who both live in the Newport Beach area, will enter an “Alford plea” to two felony drug possession charges and will make a $1 million donation to an unspecified Las Vegas-area drug treatment and rehabilitation program, defense attorney David Chesnoff said.

Alford pleas acknowledge there is evidence to secure convictions, but do not admit guilt.

Prosecutor Brad Turner said he will drop five more serious drug trafficking charges, which stemmed from the amount of heroin, methamphetamine, cocaine and several psychedelic substances that police reported finding in hard-sided travel cases in their room in August 2018.

Nicholas had been locked out of the room at the Encore at Wynn Las Vegas, police have said, and Wynn Resorts security officers who broke through the latched door found Fargo “unresponsive” with a semi-deflated balloon in her mouth and a nitrous oxide gas canister in the room.

A police officer said he believed Fargo used the balloon to inhale nitrous oxide, commonly referred to as laughing gas, and Nicholas told police he brought the canister aboard his private jet to Las Vegas for “recreational use,” according to an arrest report. Possession of nitrous oxide is not illegal.

Nicholas told police that he and Fargo had been partying at a strip club before he was locked out of the room.

Both he and Fargo denied ownership of the luggage containing drugs including marijuana, police said.

Nicholas and Fargo were not in court Wednesday but were scheduled to appear Aug. 9 to enter their pleas. Defense lawyers denied any suggestion that they might have been dealing drugs.

“By no stretch of the imagination would anyone consider Dr. Nicholas or Ms. Fargo to be traffickers distributing drugs into the community,” Chesnoff and co-counsel Richard Schonfeld said in a statement with attorney David Brown, representing Fargo.

Nicholas, 60, founded Broadcom in 1991 with Henry Samueli in a Southern California condominium, got a Ph.D. in electrical engineering from UCLA in 1998 and retired in 2003 from the publicly traded computer software, semiconductor and infrastructure company. Forbes estimates his net worth now at more than $4 billion.

He was indicted in California in 2008 on federal securities and drug charges, but the charges were dismissed in 2010 after a judge cited misconduct and witness intimidation by prosecutors. Nicholas had been accused of providing methamphetamine and ecstasy to business executives.

Chesnoff and Turner told the judge in Las Vegas on Wednesday that Nicholas has no criminal record.

The Las Vegas case will be dismissed after one year if Nicholas and Fargo complete 250 hours of community service and twice monthly personal drug counseling. If not, they will face sentencing on drug possession charges with possible sentences of probation or up to four years in prison.

The plea deal announcement came a week after defense lawyers filed documents seeking dismissal of all seven drug charges.

They argued that no one could prove ownership of the two travel cases found in the room where Brown contends that Fargo was asleep, not unconscious, and woke up after Wynn Resorts security officers broke through the latched hotel room door.

The attorneys argued that people entered and left the hotel room over a period of several days after Fargo checked in and before Nicholas arrived.

The document did not address a police report saying hotel video showed a man and a woman who appeared to be Nicholas and Fargo each carrying a black hard-sided, airtight protective case about an hour before Fargo was found in the room.

Nicholas’ attorneys have emphasized his philanthropy and backing for the California crime victim advocacy law named for his sister, Marsalee “Marsy” Nicholas. She was stalked and killed by an ex-boyfriend in the 1980s.

Eleven U.S. states, including Nevada, now have a version of the law, which aims to codify rights for crime victims and their families to confer with prosecutors and attend court proceedings.

Marsy’s Law for All, a campaign lobbying for similar laws in more states, praised what it called the “conclusion” of Nicholas’ criminal case, saying in a statement on Wednesday that he still leads the organization.",arrested for drug trafficking

Robert Greenwald, filmmaker and founder of Brave New Films, recently announced a sequel to his 2012 film “ Koch Brothers Exposed.” He said the new film will focus specifically on the duo’s efforts to buy the 2014 election, as well as how detrimental their support for Citizens United has been to the state of democracy in the United States.

While Charles and David Koch remain largely unknown figures to the majority of the American public, with 52 percent recently reporting they have never heard of them, the reality is that the brothers are arguably the most powerful and influential people in Washington — and they’ve never even been elected to office.

Americans may not recognize the men, but they’re probably familiar with the brothers’ business, Koch Industries, and its oil refineries in Alaska, Texas and Minnesota, as well as its products such as Brawny paper towels, Dixie cups, Georgia-Pacific lumber, Stainmaster carpet and Lycra, among others.

Recognizable businesses and brands aside, the public is largely unaware that the Koch brothers are doing everything they can to suppress voter rights, re-segregate public schools, weaken Environmental Protection Agency regulations and privatize Social Security.

As of March 2014, the duo, who are among the richest men in America, have spent at least $30 million this election season to prevent Senate Democrats from being re-elected.

Part of the reason the Koch brothers can spend vast amounts of money but still remain largely unknown public figures is because the Libertarians work to lower personal and corporate taxes, remove social services and limit oversight for industries, especially environmental regulations, through think tanks and generic-sounding advocacy groups such as Americans for Prosperity.

“The Kochs are on a whole different level. There’s no one else who has spent this much money,” said Charles Lewis, the founder of the Center for Public Integrity, a nonpartisan watchdog group. “The sheer dimension of it is what sets them apart. They have a pattern of lawbreaking, political manipulation, and obfuscation. I’ve been in Washington since Watergate, and I’ve never seen anything like it. They are the Standard Oil of our times.”

Puppetmasters

The Koch brothers initiated their influence on U.S. politics by forming and funding think tanks such as the first-ever Libertarian think tank the Cato Institute and electing those who shared their political ideology to local-level positions such as school boards. In recent years, though, the oil barons have used their wealth to influence public policy on a national level.

For example, in the 2000 presidential election campaign, Koch Industries reportedly spent around $900,000 to support George W. Bush and other Republicans. In 2004, the Koch brothers-founded group Citizens for a Sound Economy’s Oregon chapter was accused of working to get Ralph Nader on the presidential ballot, in a bid to weaken Democratic support for John Kerry and ensure a re-election for the Bush-Cheney White House.

After Bush was ultimately re-elected, Koch Industries and other fossil fuel companies enjoyed tremendous kickbacks such as the 2005 energy bill, which Hillary Clinton referred to as “the Dick Cheney lobbyist energy bill,” since it provided enormous subsidies and tax breaks to U.S. energy companies.

The Koch brothers also helped Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, who has been called a test-case and puppet of the Koch brothers, take down unions and their fight for a reasonable wage and collective bargaining, as well as win a special election that was held after the constitutionality of the governor’s actions were questioned. And the brothers currently own the Republican-led U.S. House of Representatives.

As they push to take over the Senate and the White House, some Democrats like Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) are coming forward and asking their colleagues to not let the Koch brothers buy their votes in order to preserve and protect democracy.

“The truth is, the Koch brothers are willing to do anything – even exploit Americans suffering from cancer – to advance their campaign of distortion,” Reid said on the Senate floor in early March. “These two multi-billionaires may spend hundreds of millions of dollars rigging the political process for their own benefit. And they may believe that whoever has the most money gets the most free speech. But I will do whatever it takes to expose their campaign to rig the American political system to benefit the wealthy at the expense of the middle class.

“Republicans are willing to defend the Koch brothers on the floor of the United States Senate. But are they willing to defend the Koch brothers’ radical policy agenda as well? If Republicans don’t support the Koch brothers’ survival of the richest philosophy, all they have to do is say so,” Reid said.

As the Koch brothers have more than enough money to fund an election campaign, some have wondered why they don’t run for office instead of buying and influencing lawmakers on Capitol Hill and in all 50 states. In fact, Charles did convince David to run for office in 1979 as the vice-presidential candidate for the Libertarian Party against Republican candidate Ronald Reagan.

David Koch may have lost the election, but according to Brian Doherty, an editor of the Libertarian magazine Reason and the author of “Radicals for Capitalism,” the experience changed the way the duo looked at politicians. The Koch brothers saw them not as lawmakers, but merely as “actors playing out a script,” and reportedly said they wanted to “supply the themes and words for the scripts.”

How they planned to influence public policy was going to be where policy ideas originate: academia and think tanks.

Abuse of wealth

Though there are several other wealthy individuals in the U.S. who found and fund private organizations, higher education institutions and super PACs, the difference between the Koch brothers and Democratic supporter George Soros, or even Republican supporter Sheldon Adelson, is that the brothers are abusing their wealth to push their self-described radical ideologies that value profit over all else. Donations made by Soros and Adelson are also much less significant than those made by the Koch brothers, raising concerns about the true intent of the Koch brothers’ donations.

Even David Koch has admitted that the family “exerts tight ideological control” over its interests.

“If we’re going to give a lot of money, we’ll make darn sure they spend it in a way that goes along with our intent,” he told Doherty. “And if they make a wrong turn and start doing things we don’t agree with, we withdraw funding.”

But since the spokespersons for about 45 public and private universities who receive funding from the Koch brothers have continued to deny that the Koch brothers manipulate the curriculum, the Koch brothers’ influence on academia continues to occur without alarming the American public.

Even groups such as Americans for Prosperity are “micromanaged by the Kochs.” That tight control seems to have paid off for the brothers, since during the Obama administration, the president’s public support has dropped to historic lows and his Democratic colleagues have been unseated by Republicans, some of whom are increasingly aligning with Libertarian views.

As the 2014 election season heats up and radical, anti-democratic ideology such as voter ID laws makes its way back into the political realm, the only thing the American public can be sure of is that the Koch brothers are not only funding smear campaigns against politicians whose political ideologies do not help their bottom line, but they are also funding the campaigns of Republican politicians who are pro-big-oil, pro-Wall Street and pro-segregation.

Since the Koch brothers have been successful in manipulating the American political system for a number of decades, even though they hide in the shadows, it’s more important than ever to look at who is funding the think tanks and higher education institutions the media enlists this election season to explain the policies that are at the center of the political debate and will ultimately affect us all.

If we fail to pay attention now, it’s evident from the Koch brothers’ record that only a few of us will continue to be allowed to actively participate in our democracy.",corruption

PARIS (Reuters) - Lamine Diack, once one of the most powerful people in athletics, was convicted in France on Wednesday of running a clique that covered up Russian doping in return for bribes worth millions of dollars and sentenced to spend at least two years in jail.

The 87-year-old former head of world athletics’ governing body was found guilty of taking kickbacks from athletes in return for concealing positive drug tests, which enabled them to continue competing, including at the 2012 London Olympics.

The court had heard how Diack solicited bribes totalling 3.45 million euros ($4.1 million) and paid off other officials at the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) to aid with the cover up.

He was also guilty of accepting Russian money to help finance Macky Sall’s 2012 presidential campaign in Senegal, Diack’s home country, the court ruled.

The former long-jumper’s actions had “undermined the values of athletics and the fight against doping”, the presiding judge said.

The court handed Diack a four-year prison sentence, two years of which are suspended and a fine of 500,000 euros. It also ordered him to pay 5 million euros in damages to World Athletics (formerly IAAF) together with his son and co-accused, Papa Massata Diack.

Lamine Diack’s lawyers said he was a scapegoat “sacrificed in the name of political correctness”, adding they would appeal the judgment which was unfair and inhumane.

He will remain under house arrest pending the appeal, which could last months.

WIDENING GRAFT PROBE

Diack led the IAAF from 1999 to 2015. In his testimony, he acknowledged slowing the handling of Russian doping cases between 2011-2013 to save a sponsorship deal with a Russian bank and avoid public scandal. But he denied the corruption allegations.

At the heart of the corruption scam alongside Diack was his son, Papa Massata.

Papa Massata, who fled France to Senegal after the French investigation began and was tried in absentia, was sentenced to five years in jail and hit with a 1 million euro fine.

Papa Massata’s lawyers in Senegal said he was denied a fair trial and would appeal.

At the outset of the trial, his Senegal-based lawyers asked that it be postponed on the grounds that COVID-19 restrictions meant they could not travel, yet the request was refused by the French judges.

French Investigators say Papa Massata is at the centre of years-long corruption probe that now spans Europe, Asia and the Americas, and includes the awarding of the 2020 Olympic Games to Tokyo and the 2016 Games to Rio de Janeiro.

In 2017, Papa Massata branded the accusation that he was part of a large corruption racket as “the biggest lie in the history of world sport.”

Four other defendants were charged in the case: Habib Cisse, Diack’s former lawyer at the IAAF; Gabriel Dollé, who oversaw doping tests at the IAAF; former head of Russian athletics Valentin Balakhnichev, and former Russian athletics’ head coach Alexei Melnikov.

All four were found guilty of corruption offences.

Balakhnichev, who also did not attend the hearing, told Reuters he too would appeal.

“I don’t live in France,” he said. “We have our own laws in Russia that protect Russian citizens.”

Colombia’s public prosecution on Friday arrested President Juan Manuel Santos ‘ top adviser on regional issues on corruption charges, just when the president was visiting one of those regions.

Carlos Ecuardo Correa, the country’s High Counselor for the Regions, became the first sitting administration official to be arrested on corruption charges since Santos took office in 2010.

According to the Prosecutor General’s Office, Correa engaged in corruption practices while he was mayor of the northern Colombian city of Monteria.

The top official voluntarily reported himself at the Prosecutor General’s Office after hearing about his impending arrest.

The latest corruption scandal follows a series of major corruption scandals regarding illegal funds entering the president’s 2010 and 2014 presidential campaigns.

Not just any top official

The arrest of the presidential adviser on region-specific issues couldn’t come at a worse time for Santos.

The top official is partly responsible for the region-specific implementation of a peace deal with FARC guerrillas signed in November last year and already plagued with irregularities and delays.

Moreover, due to the region-specific nature of the peace deal, billions of dollars, both Colombian and foreign investments, are flowing into Colombia’s diverse countryside that has long suffered state neglect while the capital grew to become half the country’s GDP.

This makes the arrest of the top adviser on such a critical element of the peace process, not just a national, but a diplomatic embarrassment for President Juan Manuel Santos.

The president is widely rejected partly due to the controversial implementation of the peace deal and partly because his apparent inability to curb corruption that has plagued the country since its inception.

Santos did not immediately respond to the arrest of his top adviser.

Santos embarrassed from Choco to Brussels

While his adviser on the regions was being read his rights, the president was in Choco, a pacific province that just weeks ago rose up over the state’s chronic state neglect, rampant corruption and violence. Correa was Santos’ main adviser over, among others, this region.

The province has a poverty rate exceeding 60%, no paved road connecting it to the rest of the country, and is overrun by illegal armed groups that have already left more than one third of the population victim of the armed conflict.

We must prioritize the breaches between the regions, give more importance to those regions who are behind most. Of course, Choco is one of them.

President Juan Manuel Santos

Santos was harshly reminded of how Colombia’s epidemic corruption and state neglect is causing extreme suffering among those living away from the capital by local resident Clorayne Galleo, whose expression alone spoke volumes.

Mr. Santos, look me straight in the face. This Choco you say you love I fight for day by day, while your police officers and ESMAD [riot unit] mistreat me constantly. I’ve also been a victim of the ‘death ride.’ You’re going to have to work on healthcare too.

Clorayne Gallego

The “death ride” is is local term for a patient dying while waiting for medical treatment or searching for a hospital that is open. According to the photographer, the woman’s niece died in one of those death rides just a few months ago as the intensive care unit she needed doesn’t exist in the capital of Choco.

This type of elementary deficiencies in the state system are virtually nationwide, particularly in the rural areas that have proven a perfect petri dish for illegal armed groups.

In whose pockets will the international peace aid end up?

The arrest of the counselor who was responsible exactly to reduce this kind of state neglect did not just ruin Santos’ visit to Choco, it further deteriorates a public lack of confidence in their Bogota government and undermines diplomatic confidence foreign peace funds do not disappear in the pockets of corrupt officials.

The enormity of the Koch fortune is no mystery. Brothers Charles and David are each worth more than $40 billion. The electoral influence of the Koch brothers is similarly well-chronicled. The Kochs are our homegrown oligarchs; they’ve cornered the market on Republican politics and are nakedly attempting to buy Congress and the White House. Their political network helped finance the Tea Party and powers today’s GOP. Koch-affiliated organizations raised some $400 million during the 2012 election, and aim to spend another $290 million to elect Republicans in this year’s midterms. So far in this cycle, Koch-backed entities have bought 44,000 political ads to boost Republican efforts to take back the Senate.

What is less clear is where all that money comes from. Koch Industries is headquartered in a squat, smoked-glass building that rises above the prairie on the outskirts of Wichita, Kansas. The building, like the brothers’ fiercely private firm, is literally and figuratively a black box. Koch touts only one top-line financial figure: $115 billion in annual revenue, as estimated by Forbes. By that metric, it is larger than IBM, Honda or Hewlett-Packard and is America’s second-largest private company after agribusiness colossus Cargill. The company’s stock response to inquiries from reporters: “We are privately held and don’t disclose this information.”

But Koch Industries is not entirely opaque. The company’s troubled legal history – including a trail of congressional investigations, Department of Justice consent decrees, civil lawsuits and felony convictions – augmented by internal company documents, leaked State Department cables, Freedom of Information disclosures and company whistle­-blowers, combine to cast an unwelcome spotlight on the toxic empire whose profits finance the modern GOP.

Under the nearly five-decade reign of CEO Charles Koch, the company has paid out record civil and criminal environmental penalties. And in 1999, a jury handed down to Koch’s pipeline company what was then the largest wrongful-death judgment of its type in U.S. history, resulting from the explosion of a defective pipeline that incinerated a pair of Texas teenagers.

The volume of Koch Industries’ toxic output is staggering. According to the University of Massachusetts Amherst’s Political Economy Research Institute, only three companies rank among the top 30 polluters of America’s air, water and climate: ExxonMobil, American Electric Power and Koch Industries. Thanks in part to its 2005 purchase of paper-mill giant Georgia-Pacific, Koch Industries dumps more pollutants into the nation’s waterways than General Electric and International Paper combined. The company ranks 13th in the nation for toxic air pollution. Koch’s climate pollution, meanwhile, outpaces oil giants including Valero, Chevron and Shell. Across its businesses, Koch generates 24 million metric tons of greenhouse gases a year.

For Koch, this license to pollute amounts to a perverse, hidden subsidy. The cost is borne by communities in cities like Port Arthur, Texas, where a Koch-owned facility produces as much as 2 billion pounds of petrochemicals every year. In March, Koch signed a consent decree with the Department of Justice requiring it to spend more than $40 million to bring this plant into compliance with the Clean Air Act.

The toxic history of Koch Industries is not limited to physical pollution. It also extends to the company’s business practices, which have been the target of numerous federal investigations, resulting in several indictments and convictions, as well as a whole host of fines and penalties.

And in one of the great ironies of the Obama years, the president’s financial-regulatory reform seems to benefit Koch Industries. The company is expanding its high-flying trading empire precisely as Wall Street banks – facing tough new restrictions, which Koch has largely escaped – are backing away from commodities speculation.

It is often said that the Koch brothers are in the oil business. That’s true as far as it goes – but Koch Industries is not a major oil producer. Instead, the company has woven itself into every nook of the vast industrial web that transforms raw fossil fuels into usable goods. Koch-owned businesses trade, transport, refine and process fossil fuels, moving them across the world and up the value chain until they become things we forgot began with hydrocarbons: fertilizers, Lycra, the innards of our smartphones.

The company controls at least four oil refineries, six ethanol plants, a natural-gas-fired power plant and 4,000 miles of pipeline. Until recently, Koch refined roughly five percent of the oil burned in America (that percentage is down after it shuttered its 85,000-barrel-per-day refinery in North Pole, Alaska, owing, in part, to the discovery that a toxic solvent had leaked from the facility, fouling the town’s groundwater). From the fossil fuels it refines, Koch also produces billions of pounds of petrochemicals, which, in turn, become the feedstock for other Koch businesses. In a journey across Koch Industries, what enters as a barrel of West Texas Intermediate can exit as a Stainmaster carpet.

Koch’s hunger for growth is insatiable: Since 1960, the company brags, the value of Koch Industries has grown 4,200-fold, outpacing the Standard & Poor’s index by nearly 30 times. On average, Koch projects to double its revenue every six years. Koch is now a key player in the fracking boom that’s vaulting the United States past Saudi Arabia as the world’s top oil producer, even as it’s endangering America’s groundwater. In 2012, a Koch subsidiary opened a pipeline capable of carrying 250,000 barrels a day of fracked crude from South Texas to Corpus Christi, where the company owns a refinery complex, and it has announced plans to further expand its Texas pipeline operations. In a recent acquisition, Koch bought Frac-Chem, a top provider of hydraulic fracturing chemicals to drillers. Thanks to the Bush administration’s anti-regulatory­ agenda – which Koch Industries helped craft – Frac-Chem’s chemical cocktails, injected deep under the nation’s aquifers, are almost entirely exempt from the Safe Drinking Water Act.

Koch is also long on the richest – but also the dirtiest and most carbon-polluting – oil deposits in North America: the tar sands of Alberta. The company’s Pine Bend refinery, near St. Paul, Minnesota, processes nearly a quarter of the Canadian bitumen exported to the United States – which, in turn, has created for Koch Industries a lucrative sideline in petcoke exports. Denser, dirtier and cheaper than coal, petcoke is the dregs of tar-sands refining. U.S. coal plants are largely forbidden from burning petcoke, but it can be profitably shipped to countries with lax pollution laws like Mexico and China. One of the firm’s subsidiaries, Koch Carbon, is expanding its Chicago terminal operations to receive up to 11 million tons of petcoke for global export. In June, the EPA noted the facility had violated the Clean Air Act with petcoke particulates that endanger the health of South Side residents. “We dispute that the two elevated readings” behind the EPA notice of violation “are violations of anything,” Koch’s top lawyer, Mark Holden, told Rolling Stone, insisting that Koch Carbon is a good neighbor.

Over the past dozen years, the company has quietly acquired leases for 1.1 million acres of Alberta oil fields, an area larger than Rhode Island. By some estimates, Koch’s direct holdings nearly double ExxonMobil’s and nearly triple Shell’s. In May, Koch Oil Sands Operating LLC of Calgary, Alberta, sought permits to embark on a multi-billion­dollar tar-sands-extraction operation. This one site is projected to produce 22 million barrels a year – more than a full day’s supply of U.S. oil.

Charles Koch, the 78-year-old CEO and chairman of the board of Koch Industries, is inarguably a business savant. He presents himself as a man of moral clarity and high integrity. “The role of business is to produce products and services in a way that makes people’s lives better,” he said recently. “It cannot do so if it is injuring people and harming the environment in the process.”

The Koch family’s lucrative blend of pollution, speculation, law-bending and self-righteousness stretches back to the early 20th century, when Charles’ father first entered the oil business. Fred C. Koch was born in 1900 in Quanah, Texas – a sunbaked patch of prairie across the Red River from Oklahoma. Fred was the second son of Hotze “Harry” Koch, a Dutch immigrant who – as recalled in Koch literature – ran “a modest newspaper business” amid the dusty poverty of Quanah. In the family legend, Fred Koch emerged from the nothing of the Texas range to found an empire. But like many stories the company likes to tell about itself, this piece of Koch­lore takes liberties with the truth. Fred was not a simple country boy, and his father was not just a small-town publisher. Harry Koch was also a local railroad baron who used his newspaper to promote the Quanah, Acme & Pacific railways. A director and founding shareholder of the company, Harry sought to build a rail line across Texas to El Paso. He hoped to turn Quanah into “the most important railroad center in northwest Texas and a metropolitan city of first rank.” He may not have fulfilled those ambitions, but Harry did build up what one friend called “a handsome pile of dinero.”

Harry was not just the financial springboard for the Koch dynasty, he was also its wellspring of far-right politics. Harry editorialized against fiat money, demanded hangings for “habitual criminals” and blasted Social Security as inviting sloth. At the depths of the Depression, he demanded that elected officials in Washington should stop trying to fix the economy: “Business,” he wrote, “has always found a way to overcome various recessions.”

In the company’s telling, young Fred was an innovator whose inventions helped revolutionize the oil industry. But there is much more to this story. In its early days, refining oil was a dirty and wasteful practice. But around 1920, Universal Oil Products introduced a clean and hugely profitable way to “crack” heavy crude, breaking it down under heat and heavy pressure to boost gasoline yields. In 1925, Fred, who earned a degree in chemical engineering from MIT, partnered with a former Universal engineer named Lewis Winkler and designed a near carbon copy of the Universal cracking apparatus – making only tiny, unpatentable tweaks. Relying on family connections, Fred soon landed his first client – an Oklahoma refinery owned by his maternal uncle L.B. Simmons. In a flash, Winkler-Koch Engineering Co. had contracts to install its knockoff cracking equipment all over the heartland, undercutting Universal by charging a one-time fee rather than ongoing royalties.

It was a boom business. That is, until Universal sued in 1929, accusing Winkler­Koch of stealing its intellectual property. With his domestic business tied up in court, Fred started looking for partners abroad and was soon doing business in the Soviet Union, where leader Joseph Stalin had just launched his first Five Year Plan. Stalin sought to fund his country’s industrialization by selling oil into the lucrative European export market. But the Soviet Union’s reserves were notoriously hard to refine. The USSR needed cracking technology, and the Oil Directorate of the Supreme Council of the National Economy took a shining to Winkler-Koch – primarily because Koch’s oil-industry competitors were reluctant to do business with totalitarian Communists.

Between 1929 and 1931, Winkler-Koch built 15 cracking units for the Soviets. Although Stalin’s evil was no secret, it wasn’t until Fred visited the Soviet Union, that these dealings seemed to affect his conscience. “I went to the USSR in 1930 and found it a land of hunger, misery and terror,” he would later write. Even so, he agreed to give the Soviets the engineering know-how they would need to keep building more.

Back home, Fred was busy building a life of baronial splendor. He met his wife, Mary, the Wellesley-educated daughter of a Kansas City surgeon, on a polo field and soon bought 160 acres across from the Wichita Country Club, where they built a Tudor­style mansion. As chronicled in Sons of Wichita, Daniel Schulman’s investigation of the Koch dynasty, the compound was quickly bursting with princes: Frederick arrived in 1933, followed by Charles in 1935 and twins David and Bill in 1940. Fred Koch lorded over his domain. “My mother was afraid of my father,” said Bill, as were the four boys, especially first-born Frederick, an artistic kid with a talent for the theater. “Father wanted to make all his boys into men, and Freddie couldn’t relate to that regime,” Charles recalled. Frederick got shipped East to boarding school and was all but disappeared from Wichita.

With Frederick gone, Charles forged a deep alliance with David, the more athletic and assertive of the young twins. “I was closer with David because he was better at everything,” Charles has said.

Fred Koch’s legal battle with Universal would drag on for nearly a quarter-century. In 1934, a lower court ruled that Winkler-Koch had infringed on Universal’s technology. But that judgment would be vacated, after it came out in 1943 that Universal had bought off one of the judges­ handling the appeal. A year later, the Supreme Court decided that Fred’s cracker, by virtue of small technical differences, did not violate the Universal patent. Fred countersued on antitrust grounds, arguing that Universal had wielded patents anti-competitively. He’d win a $1.5 million settlement in 1952.

Around that time, Fred had built a domestic oil empire under a new company eventually called Rock Island Oil & Refining, transporting crude from wellheads to refineries by truck or by pipe. In those later years, Fred also became a major benefactor and board member of the John Birch Society, the rabidly anti-communist organization founded in 1958 by candy magnate and virulent racist Robert Welch. Bircher publications warned that the Red endgame was the creation of the “Negro Soviet­ Republic” in the Deep South. In his own writing, Fred described integration as a Red plot to “enslave both the white and black man.”

Like his father, Charles Koch attended MIT. After he graduated in 1959 with two master’s degrees in engineering, his father issued an ultimatum: Come back to Wichita or I’ll sell the business. “Papa laid it on the line,” recalled David. So Charles returned home, immersing himself in his father’s world – not simply joining the John Birch Society, but also opening a Bircher bookstore. The Birchers had high hopes for young Charles. As Koch family friend Robert Love wrote in a letter to Welch: “Charles Koch can, if he desires, finance a large operation, however, he must continually be brought along.”

But Charles was already falling under the sway of a charismatic radio personality named Robert LeFevre, founder of the Freedom School, a whites-only­ libertarian boot camp in the foothills above Colorado Springs, Colorado. LeFevre preached a form of anarchic capitalism in which the individual should be freed from almost all government power. Charles soon had to make a choice. While the Birchers supported the Vietnam War, his new guru was a pacifist who equated militarism with out-of-control state power. LeFevre’s stark influence on Koch’s thinking is crystallized in a manifesto Charles wrote for the Libertarian Review in the 1970s, recently unearthed by Schulman, titled “The Business Community: Resisting Regulation.” Charles lays out principles that gird today’s Tea Party movement. Referring to regulation as “totalitarian,” the 41-year-old Charles claimed business leaders had been “hoodwinked” by the notion that regulation is “in the public interest.” He advocated the “barest possible obedience” to regulation and implored, “Do not cooperate voluntarily, instead, resist whenever and to whatever extent you legally can in the name of justice.”

After his father died in 1967, Charles, now in command of the family business, renamed it Koch Industries. It had grown into one of the 10 largest privately owned firms in the country, buying and selling some 80 million barrels of oil a year and operating 3,000 miles of pipeline. A black-diamond skier and white-water kayaker, Charles ran the business with an adrenaline junkie’s aggressiveness. The company would build pipelines to promising oil fields without a contract from the producers and park tanker trucks beside wildcatters’ wells, waiting for the first drops of crude to flow. “Our willingness to move quickly, absorb more risk,” Charles would write, “enabled us to become the leading crude-oil­gathering company.”

Charles also reconnected with one of his father’s earliest insights: There’s big money in dirty oil. In the late 1950s, Fred Koch had bought a minority stake in a Minnesota refinery that processed heavy Canadian crude. “We could run the lousiest crude in the world,” said his business partner J. Howard Marshall II – the future Mr. Anna Nicole Smith. Sensing an opportunity for huge profits, Charles struck a deal to convert Marshall’s ownership stake in the refinery into stock in Koch Industries. Suddenly the majority owner, the company soon bought the rest of the refinery outright.

Almost from the beginning, Koch Industries’ risk-taking crossed over into recklessness. The OPEC oil embargo hit the company hard. Koch had made a deal giving the company the right to buy a large share of Qatar’s export crude. At the time, Koch owned five supertankers and had chartered many others. When the embargo hit, Koch had upward of half a billion dollars in exposure to tankers and couldn’t deliver OPEC oil to the U.S. market, creating what Charles has called “large losses.” Soon, Koch Industries was caught overcharging American customers. The Ford administration in the summer of 1974 compelled Koch to pay out more than $20 million in rebates and future price reductions.

Koch Industries’ manipulations were about to get more audacious. In the late 1970s, the federal government parceled out exploration tracts, using a lottery in which anyone could score a 10-year lease at just $1 an acre – a game of chance that gave wildcat prospectors the same shot as the biggest players. Koch didn’t like these odds, so it enlisted scores of frontmen to bid on its behalf. In the event they won the lottery, they would turn over their leases to the company. In 1980, Koch Industries pleaded guilty to five felonies in federal court, including conspiracy to commit fraud.

With Republicans and Democrats united in regulating the oil business, Charles had begun throwing his wealth behind the upstart Libertarian Party, seeking to transform it into a viable third party. Over the years, he would spend millions propping up a league of affiliated think tanks and front groups – a network of Libertarians that became known as the “Kochtopus.”

Charles even convinced David to stand as the Libertarian Party’s vice-presidential candidate in 1980 – a clever maneuver that allowed David to lavish unlimited money on his own ticket. The Koch-funded 1980 platform was nakedly in the brothers’ self-interest – slashing federal regulatory agencies, offering a 50 percent tax break to top earners, ending the “cruel and unfair” estate tax and abolishing a $16 billion “windfall profits” tax on the oil industry. The words of Libertarian presidential candidate Ed Clark’s convention speech in Los Angeles ring across the decades: “We’re sick of taxes,” he declared. “We’re ready to have a very big tea party.” In a very real sense, the modern Republican Party was on the ballot that year – and it was running against Ronald Reagan.

Charles’ management style and infatuation with far-right politics were endangering his grip on the company. Bill believed his brothers’ political spending was bad for business. “Pretty soon, we would get the reputation that the company and the Kochs were crazy,” he said.

In late 1980, with Frederick’s backing, Bill launched an unsuccessful battle for control of Koch Industries, aiming to take the company public. Three years later, Charles and David bought out their brothers for $1.1 billion. But the speed with which Koch Industries paid off the buyout debt left Bill convinced, but never quite able to prove, he’d been defrauded. He would spend the next 18 years suing his brothers, calling them “the biggest crooks in the oil industry.”

Bill also shared these concerns with the federal government. Thanks in part to his efforts, in 1989 a Senate committee investigating Koch business with Native Americans would describe Koch Oil tactics as “grand larceny.” In the late 1980s, Koch was the largest purchaser of oil from American tribes. Senate investigators suspected the company was making off with more crude from tribal oil fields than it measured and paid for. They set up a sting, sending an FBI agent to coordinate stakeouts of eight remote leases. Six of them were Koch operations, and the agents reported “oil theft” at all of them.

One of Koch’s gaugers would refer to this as “volume enhancement.” But in sworn testimony before a Texas jury, Phillip Dubose, a former Koch pipeline manager, offered a more succinct definition: “stealing.” The Senate committee concluded that over the course of three years Koch “pilfered” $31 million in Native oil; in 1988, the value of that stolen oil accounted for nearly a quarter of the company’s crude-oil profits. “I don’t know how the company could have figures like that,” the FBI agent testified, “and not have top management know that theft was going on.” In his own testimony, Charles offered that taking oil readings “is a very uncertain art” and that his employees “aren’t rocket scientists.” Koch’s top lawyer would later paint the company as a victim of Senate “McCarthyism.”

By this time, the Kochs had soured on the Libertarian Party, concluding that control of a small party would never give them the muscle they sought in the nation’s capital. Now they would spend millions in efforts to influence – and ultimately take over – the GOP. The work began close to home; the Kochs had become dedicated patrons of Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas, who ran interference for Koch Industries in Washington. On the Senate floor in March 1990, Dole gloatingly cautioned against a “rush to judgment” against Koch, citing “very real concerns about some of the evidence on which the special committee was basing its findings.” A grand jury investigated the claims but disbanded in 1992, without issuing indictments.

Arizona Sen. Dennis DeConcini was “surprised and disappointed” at the decision to drop the case. “Our investigation was some of the finest work the Senate has ever done,” he said. “There was an overwhelming case against Koch.” But Koch did not avoid all punishment. Under the False Claims Act, which allows private citizens to file lawsuits on behalf of the government, Bill sued the company, accusing it of defrauding the feds of royalty income on its “volume­enhanced” purchases of Native oil. A jury concluded Koch had submitted more than 24,000 false claims, exposing Koch to some $214 million in penalties. Koch later settled, paying $25 million.

Self­interest continued to define Koch Industries’ adventures in public policy. In the early 1990s, in a high-profile initiative of the first-term Clinton White House, the administration was pushing for a levy on the heat content of fuels. Known as the BTU tax, it was the earliest attempt by the federal government to recoup damages from climate polluters. But Koch Industries could not stand losing its most valuable subsidy: the public policy that allowed it to treat the atmosphere as an open sewer. Richard Fink, head of Koch Company’s Public Sector and the longtime mastermind of the Koch brothers’ political empire, confessed to The Wichita Eagle in 1994 that Koch could not compete if it actually had to pay for the damage it did to the environment: “Our belief is that the tax, over time, may have destroyed our business.”

To fight this threat, the Kochs funded a “grassroots” uprising – one that foreshadowed the emergence, decades later, of the Tea Party. The effort was run through Citizens for a Sound Economy, to which the brothers had spent a decade giving nearly $8 million to create what David Koch called “a sales force” to communicate the brothers’ political agenda through town hall meetings and anti-tax rallies designed to look like spontaneous demonstrations. In 1994, David Koch bragged that CSE’s campaign “played a key role in defeating the administration’s plans for a huge and cumbersome BTU tax.”

Despite the company’s increasingly sophisticated political and public-relations operations, Charles’ philosophy of regulatory resistance was about to bite Koch Industries – in the form of record civil and criminal financial penalties imposed by the Environmental Protection Agency.

Koch entered the 1990s on a pipeline-buying spree. By 1994, its network measured 37,000 miles. According to sworn testimony from former Koch employees, the company operated its pipelines with almost complete disregard for maintenance. As Koch employees understood it, this was in keeping with their CEO’s trademarked business philosophy, Market­Based Management.

For Charles, MBM – first communicated to employees in 1991 – was an attempt to distill the business practices that had grown Koch into one of the largest oil businesses in the world. To incentivize workers, Koch gives employees bonuses that correlate to the value they create for the company. “Salary is viewed only as an advance on compensation for value,” Koch wrote, “and compensation has an unlimited upside.”

To prevent the stagnation that can often bog down big enterprises, Koch was also determined to incentivize risk-taking. Under MBM, Koch Industries books opportunity costs – “profits foregone from a missed opportunity” – as though they were actual losses on the balance sheet. Koch employees who play it safe, in other words, can’t strike it rich.

On paper, MBM sounds innovative and exciting. But in Koch’s hyperaggressive corporate culture, it contributed to a series of environmental disasters. Applying MBM to pipeline maintenance, Koch employees calculated that the opportunity cost of shutting down equipment to ensure its safety was greater than the profit potential of pushing aging pipe to its limits.

The fact that preventive pipeline maintenance is required by law didn’t always seem to register. Dubose, a 26-year Koch veteran who oversaw pipeline areas in Louisiana, would testify about the company’s lax attitude toward maintenance. “It was a question of money. It would take away from our profit margin.” The testimony of another pipeline manager would echo that of Dubose: “Basically, the philosophy was ‘If it ain’t broke, don’t work on it.'”

When small spills occurred, Dubose testified, the company would cover them up. He recalled incidents in which the company would use the churn of a tugboat’s engine to break up waterborne spills and “just kind of wash that thing on down, down the river.” On land, Dubose said, “They might pump it [the leaked oil] off into a drum, then take a shovel and just turn the earth over.” When larger spills were reported to authorities, the volume of the discharges was habitually low-balled, according to Dubose.

Managers pressured employees to falsify pipeline-maintenance records filed with federal authorities; in a sworn affidavit, pipeline worker Bobby Conner recalled arguments with his manager over Conner’s refusal to file false reports: “He would always respond with anger,” Conner said, “and tell me that I did not know how to be a Koch employee.” Conner was fired and later settled a wrongful-termination suit with Koch Gateway Pipeline. Dubose testified that Charles was not in the dark about the company’s operations. “He was in complete control,” Dubose said. “He was the one that was line-driving this Market-Based Management at meetings.”

Before the worst spill from this time, Koch employees had raised concerns about the integrity of a 1940s-era pipeline in South Texas. But the company not only kept the line in service, it increased the pressure to move more volume. When a valve snapped shut in 1994, the brittle pipeline exploded. More than 90,000 gallons of crude spewed into Gum Hollow Creek, fouling surrounding marshlands and both Nueces and Corpus Christi bays with a 12-mile oil slick.

By 1995, the EPA had seen enough. It sued Koch for gross violations of the Clean Water Act. From 1988 through 1996, the company’s pipelines spilled 11.6 million gallons of crude and petroleum products. Internal Koch records showed that its pipelines were in such poor condition that it would require $98 million in repairs to bring them up to industry standard.

Ultimately, state and federal agencies forced Koch to pay a $30 million civil penalty – then the largest in the history of U.S. environmental law – for 312 spills across six states. Carol Browner, the former EPA administrator, said of Koch, “They simply did not believe the law applied to them.” This was not just partisan rancor. Texas Attorney General John Cornyn, the future Republican senator, had joined the EPA in bringing suit against Koch. “This settlement and penalty warn polluters that they cannot treat oil spills simply as the cost of doing business,” Cornyn said. (The Kochs seem to have no hard feelings toward their one-time tormentor; a lobbyist for Koch was the number-two bundler for Cornyn’s primary campaign this year.)

Koch wasn’t just cutting corners on its pipelines. It was also violating federal environmental law in other corners of the empire. Through much of the 1990s at its Pine Bend refinery in Minnesota, Koch spilled up to 600,000 gallons of jet fuel into wetlands near the Mississippi River. Indeed, the company was treating the Mississippi as a sewer, illegally dumping ammonia-laced wastewater into the river – even increasing its discharges on weekends when it knew it wasn’t being monitored. Koch Petroleum Group eventually pleaded guilty to “negligent discharge of a harmful quantity of oil” and “negligent violation of the Clean Water Act,” was ordered to pay a $6 million fine and $2 million in remediation costs, and received three years’ probation. This facility had already been declared a Superfund site in 1984.

In 2000, Koch was hit with a 97-count indictment over claims it violated the Clean Air Act by venting massive quantities of benzene at a refinery in Corpus Christi – and then attempted to cover it up. According to the indictment, Koch filed documents with Texas regulators indicating releases of just 0.61 metric tons of benzene for 1995 – one-tenth of what was allowed under the law. But the government alleged that Koch had been informed its true emissions that year measured 91 metric tons, or 15 times the legal limit.

By the time the case came to trial, however, George W. Bush was in office and the indictment had been significantly pared down – Koch faced charges on only seven counts. The Justice Department settled in what many perceived to be a sweetheart deal, and Koch pleaded guilty to a single felony count for covering up the fact that it had disconnected a key pollution-control device and did not measure the resulting benzene emissions – receiving five years’ probation. Despite skirting stiffer criminal prosecution, Koch was handed $20 million in fines and reparations – another historic judgment.

On the day before Danielle Smalley was to leave for college, she and her friend Jason Stone were hanging out in her family’s mobile home. Seventeen years old, with long chestnut hair, Danielle began to feel nauseated. “Dad,” she said, “we smell gas.” It was 3:45 in the afternoon on August 24th, 1996, near Lively, Texas, some 50 miles southeast of Dallas. The Smalleys were too poor to own a telephone. So the teens jumped into her dad’s 1964 Chevy pickup to alert the authorities. As they drove away, the truck stalled where the driveway crossed a dry creek bed. Danielle cranked the ignition, and a fireball engulfed the truck. “You see two children burned to death in front of you – you never forget that,” Danielle’s father, Danny, would later tell reporters.

Unknown to the Smalleys, a decrepit Koch pipeline carrying liquid butane – literally, lighter fluid – ran through their subdivision. It had ruptured, filling the creek bed with vapor, and the spark from the pickup’s ignition had set off a bomb. Federal investigators documented both “severe corrosion” and “mechanical damage” in the pipeline. A National Transportation Safety Board report would cite the “failure of Koch Pipeline Company LP to adequately protect its pipeline from corrosion.”

Installed in the early Eighties, the pipeline had been out of commission for three years. When Koch decided to start it up again in 1995, a water-pressure test had blown the pipe open. An inspection of just a few dozen miles of pipe near the Smal­ley home found 538 corrosion defects. The industry’s term of art for a pipeline in this condition is Swiss cheese, according to the testimony of an expert witness – “essentially the pipeline is gone.”

Koch repaired only 80 of the defects – enough to allow the pipeline to withstand another pressure check – and began running explosive fluid down the line at high pressure in January 1996. A month later, employees discovered that a key anti­corrosion system had malfunctioned, but it was never fixed. Charles Koch had made it clear to managers that they were expected to slash costs and boost profits. In a sternly worded memo that April, Charles had ordered his top managers to cut expenditures by 10 percent “through the elimination of waste (I’m sure there is much more waste than that)” in order to increase pre-tax earnings by $550 million a year.

The Smalley trial underscored something Bill Koch had said about the way his brothers ran the company: “Koch Industries has a philosophy that profits are above everything else.” A former Koch manager, Kenoth Whitstine, testified to incidents in which Koch Industries placed profits over public safety. As one supervisor had told him, regulatory fines “usually didn’t amount to much” and, besides, the company had “a stable full of lawyers in Wichita that handled those situations.” When Whitstine told another manager he was concerned that unsafe pipelines could cause a deadly accident, this manager said that it was more profitable for the company to risk litigation than to repair faulty equipment. The company could “pay off a lawsuit from an incident and still be money ahead,” he said, describing the principles of MBM to a T.

At trial, Danny Smalley asked for a judgment large enough to make the billionaires feel pain: “Let Koch take their child out there and put their children on the pipeline, open it up and let one of them die,” he told the jury. “And then tell me what that’s worth.” The jury was emphatic, awarding Smalley $296 million – then the largest wrongful-death judgment in American legal history. He later settled with Koch for an undisclosed sum and now runs a pipeline-safety foundation in his daughter’s name. He declined to comment for this story. “It upsets him too much,” says an associate.

The official Koch line is that scandals that caused the company millions in fines, judgments and penalties prompted a change in Charles’ attitude of regulatory resistance. In his 2007 book, The Science of Success, he begrudgingly acknowledges his company’s recklessness. “While business was becoming increasingly regulated,” he reflects, “we kept thinking and acting as if we lived in a pure market economy. The reality was far different.”

Charles has since committed Koch Industries to obeying federal regulations. “Even when faced with laws we think are counterproductive,” he writes, “we must first comply.” Underscoring just how out of bounds Koch had ventured in its corporate culture, Charles admits that “it required a monumental undertaking to integrate compliance into every aspect of the company.” In 2000, Koch Petroleum Group entered into an agreement with the EPA and the Justice Department to spend $80 million at three refineries to bring them into compliance with the Clean Air Act. After hitting Koch with a $4.5 million penalty, the EPA granted the company a “clean slate” for certain past violations.

Then George W. Bush entered the White House in 2001, his campaign fattened with Koch money. Charles Koch may decry cronyism as “nothing more than welfare for the rich and powerful,” but he put his company to work, hand in glove, with the Bush White House. Correspondence, contacts and visits among Koch Industries representatives and the Bush White House generated nearly 20,000 pages of records, according to a Rolling Stone FOIA request of the George W. Bush Presidential Library. In 2007, the administration installed a fiercely anti-regulatory academic, Susan Dudley, who hailed from the Koch-funded Mercatus Center at George Mason University, as its top regulatory official.

Today, Koch points to awards it has won for safety and environmental excellence. “Koch companies have a strong record of compliance,” Holden, Koch’s top lawyer, tells Rolling Stone. “In the distant past, when we failed to meet these standards, we took steps to ensure that we were building a culture of 10,000 percent compliance, with 100 percent of our employees complying 100 percent.” To reduce its liability, Koch has also unwound its pipeline business, from 37,000 miles in the late 1990s to about 4,000 miles. Of the much smaller operation, he adds, “Koch’s pipeline practice and operations today are the best in the industry.”

But even as compliance began to improve among its industrial operations, the company aggressively expanded its trading activities into the Wild West frontier of risky financial instruments. In 2000, the Commodity Futures Modernization Act had exempted many of these products from regulation, and Koch Industries was among the key players shaping that law. Koch joined up with Enron, BP, Mobil and J. Aron – a division of Goldman Sachs then run by Lloyd Blankfein – in a collaboration called the Energy Group. This corporate alliance fought to prohibit the federal government from policing oil and gas derivatives. “The importance of derivatives for the Energy Group companies . . . cannot be overestimated,” the group’s lawyer wrote to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in 1998. “The success of this business can be completely undermined by . . . a costly regulatory regime that has no place in the energy industry.”

Koch had long specialized in “over-the-counter” or OTC trades – private, unregulated contracts not disclosed on any centralized exchange. In its own letter to the CFTC, Koch identified itself as “a major participant in the OTC derivatives market,” adding that the company not only offered “risk-management tools for its customers” but also traded “for its own account.” Making the case for what would be known as the Enron Loophole, Koch argued that any big firm’s desire to “maintain a good reputation” would prevent “widespread abuses in the OTC derivatives market,” a darkly hilarious claim, given what would become not only of Enron, but also Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers and AIG.

The Enron Loophole became law in December 2000 – pushed along by Texas Sen. Phil Gramm, giving the Energy Group exactly what it wanted. “It completely exempted energy futures from regulation,” says Michael Greenberger, a former director of trading and markets at the CFTC. “It wasn’t a matter of regulators not enforcing manipulation or excessive speculation limits – this market wasn’t covered at all. By law.”

Before its spectacular collapse, Enron would use this loophole in 2001 to help engineer an energy crisis in California, artificially constraining the supply of natural gas and power generation, causing price spikes and rolling blackouts. This blatant and criminal market manipulation has become part of the legend of Enron. But Koch was caught up in the debacle. The CFTC would charge that a partnership between Koch and the utility Entergy had, at the height of the California crisis, reported fake natural-gas trades to reporting firms and also “knowingly reported false prices and/or volumes” on real trades.

One of 10 companies punished for such schemes, Entergy-Koch avoided prosecution by paying a $3 million fine as part of a 2004 settlement with the CFTC, in which it did not admit guilt to the commission’s charges but is barred from maintaining its innocence.

Trading, which had long been peripheral to the company’s core businesses, soon took center stage. In 2002, the company launched a subsidiary, Koch Supply & Trading. KS&T got off to a rocky start. “A series of bad trades,” writes a Koch insider, “boiled over in early 2004 when a large ‘sure bet’ crude-oil trade went south, resulting in a quick, multimillion loss.” But Koch traders quickly adjusted to the reality that energy markets were no longer ruled just by supply and demand – but by rich speculators trying to game the market. Revamping its strategy, Koch Industries soon began bragging of record profits. From 2003 to 2012, KS&T trading volumes exploded – up 450 percent. By 2009, KS&T ranked among the world’s top-five oil traders, and by 2011, the company billed itself as “one of the leading quantitative traders” – though Holden now says it’s no longer in this business.

Since Koch Industries aggressively expanded into high finance, the net worth of each brother has also exploded – from roughly $4 billion in 2002 to more than $40 billion today. In that period, the company embarked on a corporate buying spree that has taken it well beyond petroleum. In 2005, Koch purchased Georgia Pacific for $21 billion, giving the company a familiar, expansive grip on the industrial web that transforms Southern pine into consumer goods – from plywood sold at Home Depot to brand-name products like Dixie Cups and Angel Soft toilet paper. In 2013, Koch leapt into high technology with the $7 billion acquisition of Molex, a manufacturer of more than 100,000 electronics components and a top supplier to smartphone makers, including Apple.

Koch Supply & Trading makes money both from physical trades that move oil and commodities across oceans as well as in “paper” trades involving nothing more than high-stakes bets and cash. In paper trading, Koch’s products extend far beyond simple oil futures. Koch pioneered, for sale to hedge funds, “volatility swaps,” in which the actual price of crude is irrelevant and what matters is only the “magnitude of daily fluctuations in prices.” Steve Mawer, until recently the president of KS&T, described parts of his trading operation as “black-box stuff.”

Like a casino that bets at its own craps table, Koch engages in “proprietary trading” – speculating for the company’s own bottom line. “We’re like a hedge fund and a dealer at the same time,” bragged Ilia Bouchouev, head of Koch’s derivatives trading in 2004. “We can both make markets and speculate.” The company’s many tentacles in the physical oil business give Koch rich insight into market conditions and disruptions that can inform its speculative bets. When oil prices spiked to record heights in 2008, Koch was a major player in the speculative markets, according to documents leaked by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, with trading volumes rivaling Wall Street giants like Citibank. Koch rode a trader-driven frenzy – detached from actual supply and demand – that drove prices above $147 a barrel in July 2008, battering a global economy about to enter a free fall.

Only Koch knows how much money Koch reaped during this price spike. But, as a proxy, consider the $20 million Koch and its subsidiaries spent lobbying Congress in 2008 – before then, its biggest annual lobbying expense had been $5 million – seeking to derail a raft of consumer-protection bills, including the Federal Price Gouging Prevention Act, the Stop Excessive Energy Speculation Act of 2008, the Prevent Unfair Manipulation of Prices Act of 2008 and the Close the Enron Loophole Act.

In comments to the Federal Trade Commission, Koch lobbyists defended the company’s right to rack up fantastic profits at the expense of American consumers. “A mere attempt to maximize profits cannot constitute market manipulation,” they wrote, adding baldly, “Excessive profits in the face of shortages are desirable.”

When the global economy crashed in 2008, so did oil prices. By December, crude was trading more than $100 lower per barrel than it had just months earlier – around $30. At the same time, oil traders anticipated that prices would eventually rebound. Futures contracts for delivery of oil in December 2009 were trading at nearly $55 per barrel. When future delivery is more valuable than present inventory, the market is said to be “in contango.” Koch exploited the contango market to the hilt. The company leased nine supertankers and filled them with cut-rate crude and parked them quietly offshore in the Gulf of Mexico, banking virtually risk-free profits by selling contracts for future delivery.

All in, Koch took about 20 million barrels of oil off the market, putting itself in a position to bet on price disruptions the company itself was creating. Thanks to these kinds of trading efforts, Koch could boast in a 2009 review that “the performance of Koch Supply & Trading actually grew stronger last year as the global economy worsened.” The cost for those risk-free profits was paid by consumers at the pump. Estimates pegged the cost of the contango trade by Koch and others at up to 40 cents a gallon.

Artificially constraining oil supplies is not the only source of dark, unregulated profit for Koch Industries. In the years after George W. Bush branded Iran a member of the “Axis of Evil,” the Koch brothers profited from trade with the state sponsor of terror and reckless would-be nuclear power. For decades, U.S. companies have been forbidden from doing business with the Ayatollahs, but Koch Industries exploited a loophole in 1996 sanctions that made it possible for foreign subsidiaries of U.S. companies to do some business in Iran.

In the ensuing years, according to Bloomberg Markets, the German and Italian arms of Koch-Glitsch, a Koch subsidiary that makes equipment for oil fields and refineries, won lucrative contracts to supply Iran’s Zagros plant, the largest methanol plant in the world. And thanks in part to Koch, methanol is now one of Iran’s leading non-oil exports. “Every single chance they had to do business with Iran, or anyone else, they did,” said Koch whistle-blower George Bentu. Having signed on to work for a company that lists “integrity” as its top value, Bentu added, “You feel totally betrayed. Everything Koch stood for was a lie.”

Koch reportedly kept trading with Tehran until 2007 – after the regime was exposed for supplying IEDs to Iraqi insurgents killing U.S. troops. According to lawyer Holden, Koch has since “decided that none of its subsidiaries would engage in trade involving Iran, even where such trade is permissible under U.S. law.”

These days, Koch’s most disquieting foreign dealings are in Canada, where the company has massive investments in dirty tar sands. The company’s 1.1 million acres of leases in northern Alberta contain reserves of economically recoverable oil numbering in the billions of barrels. With these massive leaseholdings, Koch is poised to continue profiting from Canadian crude whether or not the Keystone XL pipeline gains approval, says Andrew Leach, an energy and environmental economist at the business school of the University of Alberta.

Counterintuitively, approval of Keystone XL could actually harm one of Koch’s most profitable businesses – its Pine Bend refinery in Minnesota. Because tar-sands crude presently has no easy outlet to the global market, there’s a glut of Canadian oil in the midcontinent, and Koch’s refinery is a beneficiary of this oversupply; the resulting discount can exceed $20 a barrel compared to conventional crude. If it is ever built, the Keystone XL pipeline will provide a link to Gulf Coast refineries – and thus the global export market, which would erase much of that discount and eat into company profit margins.

Leach says Koch Industries’ tar-sands leaseholdings have them hedged against the potential approval of Keystone XL. The pipeline would increase the value of Canadian tar-sands deposits overnight. Koch could then profit handsomely by flipping its leases to more established producers. “Optimizing asset value through trading,” Koch literature says of these and other holdings, is a “key” company strategy.

The one truly bad outcome for Koch would be if Keystone XL were to be defeated, as many environmentalists believe it must be. “If the signal that sends is that no new pipelines will be built across the U.S. border for carrying oil-sands product,” Leach says, “that’s going to have an impact not just on Koch leases, but on everybody’s asset value in oil sands.” Ironically, what’s best for Koch’s tar-sands interests is what the Obama administration is currently delivering: “They’re actually ahead if Keystone XL gets delayed a while but hangs around as something that still might happen,” Leach says.

The Dodd-Frank bill was supposed to put an end to economy-­endangering speculation in the $700 trillion global derivatives market. But Koch has managed to defend – and even expand – its turf, trading in largely unregulated derivatives, once dubbed “financial weapons of mass destruction” by billionaire Warren Buffett.

In theory, the Enron Loophole is no longer open – the government now has the power to police manipulation in the market for energy derivatives. But the Obama administration has not yet been able to come up with new rules that actually do so. In 2011, the CFTC mandated “position limits” on derivative trades of oil and other commodities. These would have blocked any single speculator from owning futures contracts representing more than a quarter of the physical market – reducing the danger of manipulation. As part of the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, which also reps many Wall Street giants including Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase, Koch fought these new restrictions. ISDA sued to block the position limits – and won in court in September 2012. Two years later, CFTC is still spinning its wheels on a replacement. Industry traders like Koch are, Greenberger says, “essentially able to operate as though the Enron Loophole were still in effect.”

Koch is also reaping the benefits from Dodd-Frank’s impacts on Wall Street. The so-called Volcker Rule, implemented at the end of last year, bans investment banks from “proprietary trading” – investing on their own behalf in securities and derivatives. As a result, many Wall Street banks are unloading their commodities-trading units. But Volcker does not apply to nonbank traders like Koch. They’re now able to pick up clients who might previously have traded with JPMorgan. In its marketing materials for its trading operations, Koch boasts to potential clients that it can provide “physical and financial market liquidity at times when others pull back.” Koch also likely benefits from loopholes that exempt the company from posting collateral for derivatives trades and allow it to continue trading swaps without posting the transactions to a transparent electronic exchange. Though competitors like BP and Cargill have registered with the CFTC as swaps dealers – subjecting their trades to tightened regulation – Koch conspicuously has not. “Koch is compliant with all CFTC regulations, including those relating to swaps dealers,” says Holden, the Koch lawyer.

That a massive company with such a troubling record as Koch Industries remains unfettered by financial regulation should strike fear in the heart of anyone with a stake in the health of the American economy. Though Koch has cultivated a reputation as an economically conservative company, it has long flirted with danger. And that it has not suffered a catastrophic loss in the past 15 years would seem to be as much about luck as about skillful management.

The Kochs have brushed up against some of the major debacles of the crisis years. In 2007, as the economy began to teeter, Koch was gearing up to plunge into the market for credit default swaps, even creating an affiliate, Koch Financial Products, for that express purpose. KFP secured a AAA rating from Moody’s and reportedly sought to buy up toxic assets at the center of the financial crisis at up to 50-times leverage. Ultimately, Koch Industries survived the experiment without losing its shirt.

More recently, Koch was exposed to the fiasco at MF Global, the disgraced brokerage firm run by former New Jersey Gov. Jon Corzine that improperly dipped into customer accounts to finance reckless bets on European debt. Koch, one of MF Global’s top clients, reportedly told trading partners it was switching accounts about a month before the brokerage declared bankruptcy – then the eighth-largest in U.S. history. Koch says the decision to pull its funds from MF Global was made more than a year before. While MF’s small-fry clients had to pick at the carcass of Corzine’s company to recoup their assets, Koch was already swimming free and clear.

Because it’s private, no one outside of Koch Industries knows how much risk Koch is taking – or whether it could conceivably create systemic risk, a concern raised in 2013 by the head of the Futures Industry Association. But this much is for certain: Because of the loopholes in financial-regulatory reform, the next company to put the American economy at risk may not be a Wall Street bank but a trading giant like Koch. In 2012, Gary Gensler, then CFTC chair, railed against the very loopholes Koch appears to be exploiting, raising the specter of AIG. “[AIG] had this massive risk built up in its derivatives just because it called itself an insurance company rather than a bank,” Gensler said. When Congress adopted Dodd-Frank, Gensler added, it never intended to exempt financial heavy hitters just because “somebody calls themselves an insurance

In “the science of success,” Charles Koch highlights the problems created when property owners “don’t benefit from all the value they create and don’t bear the full cost from whatever value they destroy.” He is particularly concerned about the “tragedy of the commons,” in which shared resources are abused because there’s no individual accountability. “The biggest problems in society,” he writes, “have occurred in those areas thought to be best controlled in common: the atmosphere, bodies of water, air. . . .”

But in the real world, Koch Industries has used its political might to beat back the very market-based mechanisms – including a cap-and-trade market for carbon pollution – needed to create the ownership rights for pollution that Charles says would improve the functioning of capitalism.

In fact, it appears the very essence of the Koch business model is to exploit breakdowns in the free market. Koch has profited precisely by dumping billions of pounds of pollutants into our waters and skies – essentially for free. It racks up enormous profits from speculative trades lacking economic value that drive up costs for consumers and create risks for our economy.

The Koch brothers get richer as the costs of what Koch destroys are foisted on the rest of us – in the form of ill health, foul water and a climate crisis that threatens life as we know it on this planet. Now nearing 80 – owning a large chunk of the Alberta tar sands and using his billions to transform the modern Republican Party into a protection racket for Koch Industries’ profits – Charles Koch is not about to see the light. Nor does the CEO of one of America’s most toxic firms have any notion of slowing down. He has made it clear that he has no retirement plans: “I’m going to ride my bicycle till I fall off.”",corruption

The latest data dump of the Panama Papers has linked two of the richest families in Honduras, both with an ambiguous position on the 2009 U.S.-backed coup that ousted President Manuel Zelaya, to offshore companies set up in tax havens through the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca.

Jaime Rosenthal and Gilberto Goldstein are both prominent Honduran business moguls with holdings across media, banks, real estate, food products, and more. Their families are also connected by marriage through Jaime’s nephew Yankel Rosenthal and Gilberto’s daughter.

According to Panama Papers data released by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), Rosenthal’s only brother Edwin Mayer was the officer of an offshore company in the British Virgin Islands under the name Pinkenton International Corporation. One of Rosenthal’s sons, Cesar Augusto, was the sole shareholder of a Panamanian entity called Renton Management S.A.

The Rosenthal family controls Grupo Continental, a conglomerate of dozens of companies including Banco Continental, the newspaper El Tiempo and other media, a crocodile farm for leather exports, and sugar, banana, coffee, and cacao companies, among other businesses. Three Rosenthals, including head of the family, Jaime, were linked to money laundering and drug trafficking last year.

Jaime Rosenthal is a key member of the Honduran Liberal Party, the former party of ousted President Manuel Zelaya before he was removed from office, and has reportedly spoken out against the coup. But the Rosenthals may have suffered a breakdown with Zelaya before the coup.

Jaime’s son Yani was appointed Minister of the Presidency when Zelaya came to power in 2006. Yani left the post at the end of 2007 to run in the party’s internal elections, but instead joined forces with the political current led by Roberto Micheletti, the Liberal Party figure who headed the coup regime as illegitimate president after Zelaya was ousted in 2009.

Goldstein, on the other hand, is a backer of the National Party, which has traditionally traded power with the Liberal Party and returned to Honduras’ top office after the 2009 coup.

In the Panama Papers database, Gilberto Goldstein and his deceased son Mark are both listed as shareholders in the British Virgin Islands entity Melston Investment Ltd.

According to Honduran researcher Leticia Salomon, both Rosenthal and Goldstein had ambiguous and chameleon-like stances on the 2009 coup.",money laundering

Jerusalem (CNN) Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu arrived in Jerusalem's District Court on Sunday, denouncing the charges against him as his trial on corruption charges got underway.

In three cases outlining separate allegations of wrongdoing, the premier stands charged with one count of bribery and three counts of fraud and breach of trust. It is the first time a sitting Israeli prime minister has appeared in court as a defendant.

In the most serious case, Netanyahu is accused of advancing regulatory benefits worth more than 1 billion shekels (more than $283 million) in favor a telecommunications company controlled by a millionaire friend, prosecutors say. In exchange, Netanyahu received favorable coverage from a news site, even influencing wording and story selection, prosecutors allege.

Sunday's proceedings were finished in under an hour, as they were mostly procedural.

""I read the indictment and I understand its content,"" Netanyahu told the court.

He did not enter a plea, but he has repeatedly proclaimed his innocence.

Before taking his place in the courtroom, he made a statement with senior members of his Likud Party standing behind him.

He described his indictments as a ""stitch-up"" -- an effort by Israel's liberal and media elites to topple him and his right-wing bloc.

The media was looking only to film him sitting on the bench in court, Netanyahu said, adding that he would ask the court to transmit the entire trial live.

""I am here as your Prime Minister, with straight back and proud,"" he told those watching at home. ""When the public is exposed to the whole truth, the cases will crumble.""

Participants in the small district courtroom wore masks, even while speaking. As the three judges entered, Netanyahu remained standing. He sat only after a cameraman had been ushered out of the room, per an earlier agreement on court procedures.

In discussions about the timetable, defense lawyer Micha Fetman said he was new to the team and needed time to read all the material, which prosecutor Liat Ben-Ari Shweky said would take about three months.

Fetman requested all defendants -- Netanyahu, along with two businessmen and one of the businessmen's wives -- be excused from attending every court session, procedural hearings in particular, and the prosecution did not oppose the move.

Proceedings were adjourned until July 19, though it could be months before the prosecution opens.

Under Israeli law, Netanyahu does not have to resign because of the indictment. Instead, he has to resign only if he is convicted and that conviction is upheld through the appeals process.

November 2019: Netanyahu charged 03:07

In a tweet sent as the court session was coming to a close, Netanyahu's key coalition ally, Benny Gantz, wrote Netanyahu was innocent until proved guilty and expressed confidence the legal system would provide the Prime Minister with a fair trial.

Gantz, Israel's new alternate prime minister, previously had campaigned in three elections on a platform of never sitting in the same government as an indicted prime minster.

""I would like to reemphasize that my colleagues and I fully trust our legal system and law enforcement agencies. Now, perhaps more than ever, we must move toward unity and conciliation, as a country and as a society, for the State of Israel and all of its citizens,"" Gantz's tweeted Sunday.

Part of SPI’s India Series

Vijay Vital Mallya (VM) was born to industrialist and business tycoon Vital Mallya in 1955. He went on to take over his father’s business (UB Group) in 1983 at the young age of 28. VM had soaring ambition. He always looked for opportunities to expand his father’s existing business. He has been in the limelight recently as a result of financial crimes he committed before fleeing to the UK. The Indian government is working on the process of extraditing him from the UK.

Here is a timeline [1] of key events that show how VM went from being the most sought-after business man to a criminal:

2005: Vijay Mallya chairman of United Breweries (Holding) Limited, started the luxury airline: Kingfisher Airlines.

2007: Vijay Mallya acquires Air Deccan, which was a low-cost airline, from owner Capt. Gopinath.

2008: The Air Deccan takeover was formalized and UB group paid up Rs.550 crores (US$79 million) for its stake of 26% in the company.

Later that same year Kingfisher Airlines faced a loss of Rs934 crore (US$133 million) due to various reasons like oil price increases, acquisition of a financially unsound airline and other reasons.

2009: The consolidated debt of the airline accumulates to a massive Rs5,665 crore (US$810 million) that increases to Rs7,000 crores (US$1 billion). IDBI bank issues a loan of Rs900 crores (US$128 million) to the airline.

Kingfisher’s board approves a resolution to raise $100 million by various instruments including Global Depository Receipts. This was in addition to raise capital for an amount not exceeding Rs500 crore (US$71 million)by a rights issue of equity shares.
Kingfisher reports a net loss of Rs418.77 crores (US$59 million) during the second quarter of the fiscal year. Its income from operations also declines by 13.6 per cent during the quarter compared to the same period the previous year. In view of the huge losses and capacity reduction, Kingfisher decides to lay off nearly 100 pilots.

2010: Banks give the airline an ultimatum of nine months to pay back the entire loan amount that stands at $1.3 billion.

Kingfisher Airlines Board approves debt recast package. The airline’s debt now stands at Rs6,000 crore (US$858 million).
2011-Mumbai International Airport Pvt. Ltd. sends a notice to the cash-strapped airline to pay Rs90 crore (US$12million) outstanding dues.
The Income Tax Department freezes 11 accounts of Kingfisher Airlines for non-payment of tax.

2012: Kingfisher Airlines cancels several of its flights after the Income Tax Department froze some of its accounts.

The carrier operates on a trimmed schedule and faces the prospect of losing a number of prime flying slots.
International Air Transport Association asks travel agents to immediately stop booking tickets on Kingfisher’s behalf for failure to settle dues since February.
Further trouble, as employees protest delays in salary payment.
Kingfisher announces reduction of its international operations.
Revenue department of India threatens to take Kingfisher Airlines to court over alleged tax evasion, claiming the company has not deposited taxes it collected from travelers.
Lenders give two weeks to come up with a plan to improve operations. The airline had a total outstanding debt of around Rs.7,500 crore (US$1 billion)to a consortium of 17 banks led by State Bank of India (SBI).
Unpaid staff protest in Delhi, Mumbai and other airports and almost all of Kingfisher’s flights from all stations were cancelled as engineers did not certify the planes to fly.
A non-bailable arrest warrant issued against Vijay Mallya, and four other directors for non-appearance in cases relating to bouncing of cheques issued in favour of GMR Hyderabad International Airport Limited (GHIAL) towards user charges.
The carrier loses its flying license as the DGCA refused to renew its Air Operator Permit (AOP).

2013: DGCA asks the carrier to clear all dues, including pending salaries of employees, before seeking license renewal.

2014: Kingfisher Airlines reported a net loss of Rs822.42 crore (US$117 million)for the third quarter ended December 31, 2013.

United Bank of India declares Mallya and three directors of Kingfisher Airlines as willful defaulters.

2016: Banks move Supreme Court to ban Mallya’s overseas travel.

Mallya leaves India on March 2, government tells court.

Money Laundering

Allegations of money laundering were first made when it was speculated that Mallya had used loan money received from the banks and diverted them overseas to various tax havens. Mallya laundered the money with the help of shell companies with dummy directors that were controlled by him. The shell companies were located in seven countries, including the United Kingdom , USA, Ireland and France [2]. These companies did not have any activity and independent source of income. Mallya was controlling the companies through his office personnel. The directors in said companies acted on directions of UB Group at the command of Mallya [3].

Classified As a “Proclaimed Offender”

In order to understand why Vijay Mallya was labelled a “proclaimed offender”, it is important to know the exact meaning of this term:

According to section 82(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code,1973(CrPc) if any Court in India has any reason to believe a person against whom a warrant has been issued has absconded or is concealing himself in such a manner that the warrant cannot be executed, then such court can publish a written proclamation requiring him to appear at a specified place and specified time. The person is required to appear in not less than thirty days of the publishing of the written proclamation by the court. Section 82(2) provides the various ways in which the court can publish the written proclamation.

Section 82(4) mentions that any person who does not comply with provisions mentioned in Section 82(1), the Court may after making inquiry as it thinks fit, pronounce him a “proclaimed offender” and issue a declaration to that effect.

In the case of VM, he fled the country on March 2, 2016 after a consortium of banks moved the Supreme Court to recover Rs.9,000 crores (US$1.3 billion) they claimed he owed them. On April 18, 2016, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) issued a non-bailable warrant against VM to appear in court after rejecting his plea that all allegations against his company were ‘false and incorrect’ [4].

The ED summoned VM thrice to appear in the court and testify, but he failed to do so. This behavior caused him to be termed as a “proclaimed offender”.

Ethics Analysis

As per Section 166 of the Companies Act, 2013 [5], the director of any company incorporated under the Act has certain duties.

Firstly, the director has the duty to act in good faith to achieve the overall objectives of the company and to act in the best interest of all its members, employees, shareholders, community and environment.

Next, he is required to exercise his duties with due and reasonable care, skill and diligence and exercise his own independent judgements.

He must not be involved in situations that may directly or indirectly be in conflict with the interests of the company. Lastly, he must never achieve or try to achieve any kind of unjustified gains for himself or for a person of his choice and if he does so can be liable for fine equal to the amount of the undue gain.

1. Failing in his fiduciary duty to shareholders, employees, and investors:

A director of a company is expected to always put the interests of the corporation and all the people involved with it above his own personal interests. He is expected to remain loyal and ensure to maintain the trust of shareholders, employees and investors. Any kind of conflict of interest, such as earning a secret profit, unknown/undisclosed business dealings show disloyalty on the part of the director.
The director of Kingfisher Airlines, Vijay Mallya resorted to such practices for his own gains.
Kingfisher airlines, the second largest airlines in India, did not generate profits for 8 years. [6]
Mallya did not stop operations in spite of making only losses and allowed shareholders and customers to be under the illusion the airline was functioning properly.
In 2012, the losses of the airline were publicly discussed when Mallya failed to pay the salaries of his employees. When asked about this, Mallya made statements about not having enough money to pay the salaries due to reported losses.
Soon in 2013, Diageo acquired a 27% stake in United Spirits Limited for Rs.6,500 crores (US$902 million). However, not a single lender or employee was paid.
There was speculation that Mallya had his own agenda and invested the money in his IPL (Indian Premier League) cricket team. A few years later he spent a lot of the funds for his elaborate birthday bash which featured renowned singer Enrique Iglesias [7].
Such instances are clear examples of Mallya violating his fiduciary duties as a director of a company.

2. Non-Disclosure of Non-Compete Clause

A probe by the Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO) in India found that corporate ethics were compromised in the merger between Kingfisher Airlines and Deccan Aviation Limited [8].
Kingfisher Airlines had created three new departments in the airline to avoid paying capital gains tax.
In addition, a non-compete fee of Rs.30 Crores (US$4 million) was paid to the owner of Deccan Aviation, Captain Gopinath, which was not disclosed to shareholders.
Transparency is vital in a listed business. Full disclosure of information must be provided to the shareholders, so they can make informed decisions.
Any kind of non-disclosure of important details points to the dishonesty of the company director and shows how little he cares about his shareholders.

3. Misuse of Power [9]

There is a celebrated quote, “With great power comes great responsibility [10] ”.
The primary responsibility that arises with power is the responsibility not to misuse such power.
In 2010 Mallya was selected to be an MP of the Rajya Sabha (Upper House), in the Indian Parliament and used his position for his personal use.
He misused his position as a Member of Parliament to ensure he was put in the civil aviation committee. He did so to speed up the approval of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) into the aviation sector. This expedited approval assured that foreign investors could invest in Kingfisher Airlines when the airlines was hitting its lowest point [11].
VM took advantage of access to Parliament. He discussed informally with Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, within the corridors of Parliament, the possibility of convincing banks to settle with Kingfisher Airlines. The Finance Minister claims to have denied his request as it was not made according to formal protocols. Immediately after this, Mallya fled the country. The following statement was made by the Finance Minister in response to the allegations:

Statement from Mr. Jaitley [12]:

“My attention has been drawn to a statement made to the media by Vijay Mallya on having met me with an offer of settlement.

The statement is factually false in as much as it does not reflect the truth. Since 2014, I have never given him any appointment to meet me and the question of his having met me does not arise. However, since he was a Member of Rajya Sabha and he occasionally attended the House, he misused that privilege on one occasion while I was walking out of the House to go to my room. He paced up to catch up with me and while walking uttered a sentence that “I am making an offer of settlement”. Having been fully briefed about his earlier “bluff offers”, without allowing him to proceed with the conversation, I curtly told him “there was no point talking to me and he must make offers to his bankers.” I did not even receive the papers that he was holding in his hand. Besides this one sentence exchange where he misused his privilege as a Rajya Sabha Member, in order to further his commercial interest as a bank debtor, there is no question of my having ever given him an appointment to meet me.”

The above instances reflect Mallya’s leadership qualities. He appears to be disconnected from the situation facing his employees, shareholders and other persons dependant on the company and its reputation. Though he is not legally liable to pay salaries to employees from his personal wealth, he could have taken moral responsibility for his actions that caused suffering in the lives of people whose livelihoods were dependent on Kingfisher Airlines. Mallya was an inspiration to many. His wealthy way of living fascinated them but some personal austerity wassurely required.

Yet in an interview, Vijay Mallya made the following statement and refused to take responsibility for the financial mess:

“In a Public Limited Company where is one man, who might be the chairman, responsible for the finances of the entire Company? And what has it got to do with all my other businesses? I have built up and run the largest spirits company in the world in this country.”

Recently Forbes Magazine dropped Mallya from their Billionaire list and stated his current net worth is only USD 800 million . He made a satirical comment on twitter:

Vijay Mallya ‏@TheVijayMallya:

“Thanks to the Almighty that Forbes has removed me from the so called Billionaires list. Less jealousy, less frenzy and wrongful attacks.”

Present Standing of the Case [13]

Understandably, India wants Mallya to face criminal action relating to loans taken out by his defunct Kingfisher Airlines and Indian authorities want to recover about $1.3 billion they say Kingfisher owes.

On December 5, 2018, five days before the decision of Mallya’s extradition case, he further appeals to the banks to accept his settlement offer and also agrees to pay 100% of the principal loan amount he owes to them. He further justifies his actions in a series of tweets:

December 10, 2018 [14]: The Westminster Magistrates’ Court in London on Monday orders United Breweries chairman Vijay Mallya’s extradition to India. Indian finance minister Arun Jaitley welcoms the court’s decision on Mallya.

Mallya Redux

It is not easy to manage so many different companies at once and ensure they are all successful. Mallya had taken lot of risks and made new investments that his father had never made. An in depth study of the case shows that a majority of Mallya’s dealings were done for his own personal gains and not for the overall benefit of his employees, shareholders and investors. Mallya committed financial fraud and most importantly ethical violations by breaking the trust of the people who were not only dependant on his company but who even looked up to him as a role model. Mallya explains himself through his tweets, sitting in a far off country and communicating through social and other media. Instead of acting in this pathetically unethical way, he should return India and agree to trial in court as a virtuous person would do. Another aspect of this case most people tend to overlook is the mistake committed by the Indian Banks. It is their duty to conduct proper credit checks before sanctioning loans of such a large amounts to one company. Apparently, certain procedures and processes were omitted in order to grant loans to Kingfisher Airlines. The government of re-elected Narendra Modi should take note of this high profile case and put efforts into preventing similar behaviour in the future. A change in existing laws or introduction of a new law seems appropriate. Then again, the Indian government seems to be failing to keep a check on unethical and illegal behavior by tycoons, as the recent scam of renowned businessman and jeweller Nirav Modi [15] has once again shaken the nation.

A woman jailed for controlling prostitutes across the country has been ordered to pay back more than £400,000.

Sun Sun Wong, 45, was sentenced to five years in February 2018 for two counts of controlling prostitution for gain - and one count of money laundering.

She was caught after police posed as clients in an operation in Cambridge to safeguard vulnerable women.

Wong, of Blucher Street, Birmingham, was ordered to pay £442,260.50 after a proceeds of crime hearing.

At Peterborough Crown Court, Judge Matthew Lowe ordered she had three months to repay the money.

'Crime doesn't pay'

Cambridgeshire Police said that in October 2015, January 2016 and February 2016 undercover officers had arranged to meet with two women and were given an address in Midsummer Court, Cambridge.

The force said that each time they were greeted by lone women who did not have the mobile phone used to make the appointment.

In February 2016, they met a woman in Blucher Street, Birmingham.

The properties were being rented out by Wong and her mobile phone number was linked to the accounts set up in the names of various prostitutes.

Police said Wong denied any wrongdoing, claiming a woman called Anita had used her identity to carry out the crimes.

Det Con Andrew McKeane said the hearing on Thursday ""demonstrates that crime doesn't pay"".

""It has ensured that Wong will be stripped of the profit she made from her crimes, and is a fitting conclusion to the appalling offences she has committed.",jailed

The Portuguese attorney’s office has confirmed it conducted dozens of searches on Wednesday in connection withits investigation into tax evasion and money laundering at some of the country’s biggest clubs, as well as the super-agent Jorge Mendes.

The latest stage of Operation Fora de Jogo (Operation Offside) involved almost 300 tax and police inspectors from the public prosecutor’s office conducting 76 searches, including the offices of the top‑division sides Porto, Benfica, Sporting, Braga, Guimarães, Marítimo, Estoril and Portimonense.

“Sport Lisboa e Benfica – Futebol SAD and its chairman of the board of directors confirm the search this morning of their facilities, reaffirming their total availability, as always, to collaborate with the authorities in clarifying all issues that may arise. be raised under this or any other process,” the league leaders Benfica said in a statement.

The offices of Carlos Osório de Castro, Cristiano Ronaldo’s lawyer, and the Gestifute agency in Porto and Lisbon – the Juventus forward’s representative that was established by Mendes – were also targeted, as were two of the agent’s homes in the Portuguese capital.

“As part of an investigation conducted by the public ministry of the Central Department of Investigation and Penal Action (DCIAP) and whose investigation is in charge of the Tax and Customs Authority (AT), 76 searches are under way, including house searches, namely, in several football clubs, their societies and managers, law firms and intermediaries,” the attorney’s office said in a statement. “The investigation is likely to be part of the practice of crimes of qualified tax fraud and money laundering.”

The Portuguese magazine Sabado showed pictures of officials leaving Gestifute’s headquarters with the Porto president, Jorge Nino Pinto da Costa, and the Benfica president, Luís Filipe Vieira, also said to be part of the investigation. Last month it was claimed authorities were looking into potential money laundering relating to the transfers of players including Radamel Falcao, James Rodríguez and Iker Casillas acting on information disclosed by Football Leaks, although Porto denied anyone at the club had been questioned. According to Sabado the homes of Casillas, Jackson Martínez, Maxi Pereira and Danilo Pereira were also searched.

“The facts under investigation and which motivated the opening of the cases in question originated in several inspection procedures carried out since 2015 by the Tax and Customs Authority, and driven by it, based on the information available internally, within the scope of business related to the world of professional football,” added a statement from the Portuguese tax authority.

As well as Ronaldo, Gestifute represents José Mourinho and several members of the Wolves squad, where Mendes also acts as an adviser to the club and to its owner, the Chinese conglomerate Fosun. He has yet to comment on Wednesday’sdevelopments.",tax evasion searches

A Brisbane accountant has been charged with multiple money laundering offences over her alleged involvement in a “relentless” email scam worth more than $3 million.

The 65-year-old Carina woman has been accused of being a “money mule” for hackers who had fraudulently gained access to the email accounts of businesses.

Police have alleged hackers sent fake or falsified invoices to businesses who then sent cash to the woman.

It’s alleged the woman’s job was to funnel the money that was paid to her by the businesses and send it overseas.

A joint investigation between Queensland police and the Australian Federal Police uncovered at least seven victims had unwittingly transferred $3.3 million to more than 50 accounts linked to the woman over the last 12 months.

Detective Inspector Vince Byrnes said the woman’s alleged role was “vital” to helping the hackers.

“The alleged offending in this case is very concerning, it’s relentless in nature and has a very poor effect on our community and our economy,” he said.

“Anybody who is thinking of putting money through their account on behalf of somebody they don’t know — I would warn them not to do so.”

Email compromise team investigator Detective Senior Constable Adrian Holt said one victim alone had been scammed more than $1 million.

“They range from large-scale business that pay bills to that value right down to small business, aged care, self-funded superannuation funds,” he said.

The woman was arrested yesterday after her home was raided by the state’s Financial and Cyber Crime Group.

Detectives seized computers and phones and she was charged with several offences involving dealing in the proceeds of crime.

She is expected to appear in the Brisbane Magistrates Court on October 16.

Detective Inspector Byrnes said it was important for the community to be aware of scams and for people to safeguard their email accounts.

“Businesses of any size can be targeted so it’s important to regularly review processes,” he said.

“To reduce victimisation in our community, examine those invoices, check the bank account details … verify independently with that vendor.

“It’s important we protect our community by being vigilant ourselves.”",charged

The UN has dropped sanctions against former Afghan warlord Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, paving the way for him to return to the country.

The Afghan government asked for the move as part of a deal with Mr Hekmatyar and his militant group in September.

The deal grants him immunity in return for support for the Afghan constitution and a promise to abandon violence.

He fought the Soviet occupation but was later accused of shelling civilians.

Mr Hekmatyar is also a former Afghan prime minister and his Hezb-e-Islami militant group is the second biggest in the country.

He was forced to flee Kabul in 1996 when the Taliban came to power and in 2003 was designated as a terrorist by the US.

Mr Hekmatyar's whereabouts remain unknown. He did not attend the signing ceremony in Kabul for the deal with the government.

Under the UN Security Council move, his assets are unfrozen and a travel ban is rescinded.

The 'Butcher of Kabul' - Virginia Gidley-Kitchin, BBC News

As a guerrilla leader in the 1980s, Gulbuddin Hekmatyar had air of icy menace about him that hinted at ruthless ambition, a characteristic he demonstrated to the full during the ferocious power-struggle that followed the end of the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan.

He became known as the Butcher of Kabul for his faction's indiscriminate firing of rockets into the capital. The death and destruction this caused led many Afghans to welcome the takeover of the Taliban.

Once one of the main recipients of western aid, Gulbuddin Hekmatyar was deeply hostile to the west and was later accused by the US state department of supporting attacks by al-Qaeda and the Taliban.

The deal between Mr Hekmatyar and the Afghan government was seen as being highly symbolic because it is the first to be concluded without UN or international mediation.

BBC Afghan Service editor Waheed Massoud said Mr Hekmatyar appeared to have calculated that he would be more significant as a political leader in Kabul than as the leader of a group of fighters up in the mountains who are also competing with the Taliban for influence.",in 2003 was designated as a terrorist

A panel investigating spot-fixing in the Indian Premier League has found a top cricket team official guilty of illegal betting, media reports say.

The panel's report said Gurunath Meiyappan of Chennai Super Kings passed on information to illegal bookmakers.

Spot-fixing involves players bowling wides and no-balls at certain times arranged beforehand with bookmakers.

Mr Meiyappan has not yet commented on the report's findings, but he denied the allegations last year.

The three-member panel, headed by Justice Mukul Mudgal, was formed by the Supreme Court to investigate spot-fixing and illegal betting in the Indian Premier League last year. It submitted its 170-page report to the court on Monday.

""Roots of corruption and malpractices have crept in deep into the game of cricket, more particularly the IPL, and are seeping into the game at an alarming rate,"" said the report, which was seen by the AFP news agency.

It said the allegations against Mr Meiyappan - son-in-law of N Srinivasan, head of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) - needed further investigation.

Mr Srinivasan, who is also the owner of the Chennai Super Kings team, ""stepped aside"" from his post as BCCI president in June last year after Mr Meiyappan was arrested over allegations of betting in the IPL.

Mr Meiyappan has since been released on bail, and Mr Srinivasan has returned as the head of the cricket board. Mr Srinivasan was elected head of cricket's world body, the International Cricket Council (ICC), on Saturday.

Last July Indian cricketer and Rajasthan Royals fast bowler S Sreesanth was charged along with 38 other people over the IPL spot-fixing scandal.

In September, India's cricket board handed a life ban to Sreesanth and his Royals teammate Ankeet Chavan.

The IPL is considered to be the world's showcase for Twenty20 cricket.

Top Indian and international players take part, contributing to what is the world's richest cricket tournament.

A California couple pleaded guilty yesterday to conspiring to commit mail fraud and tax evasion, announced Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Richard E. Zuckerman of the Justice Department’s Tax Division and U.S. Attorney Robert S. Brewer, Jr. for the Southern District of California.

According to court documents and statements made in court, married couple Geraldine Hill and Clayton Hill operated On Your Feet (OYF), also known as Family Resource Center, a tax-exempt charitable organization whose stated mission was to provide assistance to low income families and individuals in need. From 2011 through 2016, the Hills fraudulently obtained more than $1.35 million in donated clothing and other items by falsely representing to the donors that the items would be given to needy recipients. In fact, the Hills made charitable donations of only about $13,000, sold the remaining donated items, and used the proceeds to financially enrich themselves and others. To conceal their conduct from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the Hills filed false charitable tax returns for OYF and false personal tax returns that did not report the income they received from their scheme.

“The Hills not only evaded their taxes, but they did so by abusing their company’s tax-exempt charitable status and thereby cheated not only the public fisc but the donors and intended beneficiaries of the donations,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Richard E. Zuckerman. “As the guilty pleas make clear, this conduct will not go unpunished.”

“I am committed to using the resources of the U.S. Attorney’s Office in the Southern District of California to aggressively pursue fraudsters and tax cheats,” said U.S. Attorney Robert S. Brewer Jr. for the Southern District of California. “The conduct by Geraldine and Clayton Hill is particularly offensive because they used the benefits afforded by the 501(c)(3) status of their charity to defraud donors and conceal their profits. By abusing the generosity of companies and individuals who put their faith in the promises made by the Hills, the defendants threatened to undermine the trust and integrity underpinning charitable giving.”

“Geraldine Hill and Clayton Hill exploited the public trust and charitable giving by using their charity to solicit over $16 million in goods from hardworking businesses and falsely promising to donate those goods to assist low income families and individuals in need,” said Ryan L. Korner, Special Agent in Charge of the IRS Criminal Investigation Division. “Instead, the Hills resold the goods and profited over $1.34 million which they spent on vehicles, vacations, and entertainment, as well as personal expenses for their family members. The Hills concealed their fraud by filing false tax returns on behalf of the charity and failing to report their illicit income to the IRS. Their guilty pleas evidence the hard work of IRS Criminal Investigation Special Agents to bring to justice those that defraud businesses in the name of charity, and who benefit themselves instead of serving those most in need.”

“While fraud is always wrong, the theft of charitable donations that were to be used to help San Diego’s low income families is particularly disheartening,” said Acting FBI Special Agent in Charge Omer Meisel. “This type of fraud and deceit for personal gain simply cannot be tolerated. The FBI is committed to ensuring that white collar predators don’t prevent those less fortunate from receiving all the benefits that generous donors provide to seemingly legitimate non-profit organizations.”

U.S. District Judge Dana M. Sabraw scheduled the sentencing for Aug. 28, 2020. At sentencing, the Hills face a maximum sentence of five years in prison for each mail fraud conspiracy and tax evasion. The Hills also face a period of supervised release, restitution, and monetary penalties.

LAS VEGAS (KSNV) — China limits how much money one person convert into foreign currency each year. Two Las Vegas men who helped gamblers bypass that limit have found themselves in deep trouble with the IRS.

Las Vegas residents Bing Han and Lei Zhang have pleaded guilty to Operation of Unlicensed Money Transmitting Business, the IRS announced on Monday.

According to the IRS, China-based customers would transfer money into Han and Zhang's Chinese bank accounts. In return, the men would transfer an equal amount of money in US Dollars their customer's US-based accounts. The two would then receive a commission for the money transferred.

Han and Zhang both say that casino hosts would regularly introduce customers to them. These customers, who were not legally allowed to convert more than $50,000 worth of Chinese Yuan each year, wanted more money to gamble with. Han and Zhang were more than willing to oblige. The casino hosts, the IRS stated, would often receive a cut of the commission.

These actions, the IRS says, violated both China's capital controls and the United States' anti-money-laundering laws.

“The United States stands vigilant against the constantly evolving ways in which individuals and organizations seek to operate outside the conventional financial system,"" said U.S. Attorney Robert S. Brewer. ""Violating United States anti-money laundering laws not only endangers the integrity of the global financial system, but doing so hinders the ability of law enforcement officers to confront criminal conduct including money laundering and narcotics trafficking.”

DEA Special Agent in Charge John W. Callery says that these laws are in place to prevent drug trafficking organizations from laundering money.

“Although Mr. Han and Mr. Zhang did not admit to transacting narcotics proceeds in their unlicensed money transmitting businesses, we know that drug trafficking organizations are willing to use a variety of businesses to launder proceeds from the sales of drugs,” said Callery. “DEA and our outstanding partners will continue to investigate illicit financial transactions and anyone who may operate businesses that stand to profit from illegal drug sales.”

Han and Zhang both face a maximum of five years in prison. Han is scheduled to be sentenced on May 1, and Zhang is scheduled to be sentenced on May 4. Both face a maximum of 5 years in prison.

No information about the casino hosts, or which resorts they worked for, was released by the IRS. It's unclear whether any of the hosts are being investigated.","money laundering, financial crime"
TMML2024033513353,Charles Ponzi,"Alert ID: TMML2024033513353
Who Was Charles Ponzi?

Charles Ponzi was the infamous swindler who payed out returns with other investors' money. The ""Ponzi scheme"" is named after him. After running a highly profitable and expansive investment scheme, Ponzi was arrested on August 12, 1920, and charged with 86 counts of mail fraud. Owing an estimated $7 million, he pleaded guilty to mail fraud, and subsequently spent 14 years in prison.

Coming to America

The details of the infamous swindler Charles Ponzi's early life are difficult to verify. It is believed, however, that he was born Carlo Ponzi in Parma, Italy, and attended the University of Rome La Sapienza.

Ponzi arrived in Boston in November 1903 aboard the S.S. Vancouver. He later told the New York Times that he gambled away most of his money on the voyage to America. ""I landed in this country with $2.50 in cash and $1 million in hopes, and those hopes never left me."" The young immigrant’s charisma and confidence would help him pull off one of the greatest financial schemes in history.

Early Scams

Ponzi started out working odd jobs, including as a dishwasher in a restaurant. In 1907, he moved to Montreal, where he found a job as a teller at Bank Zarossi. The bank was formed to cater to the new Italian immigrant population, charging high interest rates.

When Bank Zarossi went bankrupt because of bad loans, Ponzi was left penniless. He was sentenced to three years in a Quebec prison after he was caught forging a bad check. Rather than tell his mother in Italy that he was in prison, he wrote to her in a letter that he was working at a Canadian prison.

When he was released from jail, Ponzi got involved in yet another criminal venture, smuggling Italian immigrants across the border into the United States. This too landed him in jail—he spent two years behind bars in Atlanta.

Ponzi Scheme

Ponzi returned to Boston, where he married stenographer Rose Gnecco in 1918. He worked various jobs, including at his father-in-law's grocery store, but none of those positions lasted long.

It was during this time that Ponzi got the idea for the great scheme that would earn his name a place in history. He received a letter in the mail from a company in Spain that contained in it an international reply coupon (a coupon that can be exchanged for a number of priority airmail postage stamps from another country). Ponzi realized that he could turn a profit by buying IRCs in one country, and exchanging them for more expensive stamps in another country.

Ponzi's racket worked like this: He would send money to agents working for him in other countries, who would buy IRCs and send them back to the United States. Ponzi would then exchange the IRC for stamps worth more than he paid for them, and sell the stamps. Ponzi reportedly made more than 400 percent on some of these sales.

Not satisfied with running the profitable scheme on his own, Ponzi began to seek investors to turn even higher profits. He promised investors outrageous returns of 50 percent in 45 days, or 100 percent in 90 days. Ponzi paid these investors using money from other investors, rather than with actual profit—as in the criminal scheme of Bernie Madoff.

Ponzi's manipulation made him very rich—he bought a mansion in Lexington, Massachusetts, with air conditioning and a heated swimming pool. He reportedly made $250,000 a day.

Downfall and Death

Ponzi's scheme began to unravel in August 1920, when The Boston Post began to investigate his returns. The investigation set off a run on Ponzi's company, with investors trying to pull their money out of it.

Charles Ponzi was arrested on August 12, 1920, and charged with 86 counts of mail fraud. Owing an estimated $7 million, he pleaded guilty to mail fraud, and subsequently spent 14 years in prison. Rose divorced him in 1937, and Ponzi died penniless in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on January 18, 1949.",Ponzi scheme

The U.S. Department of State’s Rewards for Justice program is offering a reward of up to $10 million for information on the activities, networks, and associates of Muhammad Kawtharani, a senior Hizballah military commander. This announcement is part of the Department’s standing reward offer for information leading to the disruption of the financial mechanisms of the terrorist organization Lebanese Hizballah.

Muhammad Kawtharani is a senior leader of Hizballah’s forces in Iraq and has taken over some of the political coordination of Iran-aligned paramilitary groups formerly organized by Qassim Sulemani after Sulemani’s death in January. In this capacity, he facilitates the actions of groups operating outside the control of the Government of Iraq that have violently suppressed protests, attacked foreign diplomatic missions, and engaged in wide-spread organized criminal activity. As a member of Hizballah’s Political Council, Kawtharani has worked to promote Hizballah’s interests in Iraq, including Hizballah efforts to provide training, funding, political, and logistical support to Iraqi Shi’a insurgent groups.

The U.S. Department of the Treasury designated Kawtharani as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist in 2013.

In April 2019, Rewards for Justice announced a reward of up to $10 million for information leading to the disruption of the financial mechanisms of the global terrorist organization Lebanese Hizballah.

Rewards can be provided for information leading to the identification and disruption of:

Sources of revenue for Hizballah or its key financial facilitation mechanisms;
Major Hizballah donors or financial facilitators;
Financial institutions or exchange houses facilitating Hizballah transactions;
Businesses or investments owned or controlled by Hizballah or its financiers;
Front companies engaged in international procurement of dual-use technology on behalf of Hizballah; and
Criminal schemes involving Hizballah members and supporters which financially benefit the organization.

Hizballah is a Lebanon-based terrorist organization that receives weapons, training, and funding from Iran, which the Secretary of State designated as a state sponsor of terrorism in 1984. Hizballah generates about a billion dollars a year from a combination of direct financial support from Iran, international businesses and investments, donor networks, and money laundering activities. The State Department designated Hizballah as a Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) in October 1997 under the Immigration and Nationality Act, and as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT) in October 2001 under Executive Order (E.O.) 13224.

More information about these reward offers is located on the Rewards for Justice website at www.rewardsforjustice.net. We encourage anyone with information on Hizballah financial networks to contact the Rewards for Justice office via the website, e-mail (LH@rewardsforjustice.net), phone (1-800-877-3927 in North America), or mail (Rewards for Justice, Washington, D.C., 20520-0303, USA). Individuals may also contact the Regional Security Officer at the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate. All information will be kept strictly confidential.

The Rewards for Justice Program is an effective law enforcement tool and is administered by the U.S. Department of State’s Diplomatic Security Service. Since its inception in 1984, the program has paid in excess of $150 million to more than 100 people who provided actionable information that helped bring terrorists to justice or prevented acts of international terrorism worldwide.

The U.S. Treasury Department said Wednesday it placed Kingpin Act sanctions on an alleged Colombian drug trafficker, along with seven other individuals and five entities supporting him.

Fernain Rodriguez Vasquez leads an international drug-trafficking and money laundering organization based in Colombia that exported nearly 100 tons of cocaine per year, Treasury said. He also managed the daily narcotics trafficking operations of Jorge Fadlallah Cheaitelly, who was placed under sanctions in December 2011, Treasury said.

""These sanctions will expose Rodriguez Vasquez's illicit network of agents and front companies and exclude them from the legitimate financial system,"" said Adam J. Szubin, director of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control in a statement.

In addition, Treasury placed sanctions on seven of Mr. Rodriguez Vasquez's associates, all of whom were indicted Feb. 14 in the Eastern District of Texas on drug-trafficking charges, Treasury said. As a result of arrest warrants and the indictment, Treasury said Colombian authorities arrested 11 people in August 2013, including Mr. Rodriguez Vasquez and four others targeted Wednesday with sanctions.

Those arrested were known to collaborate with the FARC rebels, as well as Mexico's Sinaloa and Zetas cartels, Treasury said. Mr. Rodriguez Vasquez utilized FARC to protect cocaine labs in Colombia and to escort drug loads, and he provided Zetas members with tons of cocaine, which was ultimately distributed in the U.S., Treasury said.","paywalled, but the introduction can be scraped"

Craig Sutton, 37, carried out the operation while he was an inmate at HMP Perth, HMP Edinburgh, and HMP Addiewell in West Lothian.

The offences only came to light when Sutton's cell at HMP Addiewell was searched after a fire alarm went off in a neighbouring cell.

He will be sentenced in October.

Co-accused Natalie Williamson, 29, from Renfrew, who admitted allowing her bank account to be used to deposit £30,000 of criminal money will be sentenced at the same time.

The High Court in Glasgow was told the offences took place between February 2015 and July 2017.

Letters seized

Prosecutor Mark McGuire said an initial search of Sutton's cell revealed heroin, drug paraphernalia, and a suspected tick list.

A subsequent full search found dozens of letters addressed to Sutton from other prisoners.

There was also an unsent letter written by Sutton in which he set out his plan to smuggle drugs into prison.

Police also seized recordings of all telephone calls made or received by Sutton since he was jailed in 2014.

Mr McGuire said: ""Those recordings included frequent discussions between the accused Sutton and the accused Williamson during which Sutton made frequent reference to his trafficking in heroin and ecstasy inside and outside of the prison estate.

""Discussions also took place between the two regarding the use of Williamson's bank account to receive the money owed to Sutton for drugs.""

Prisons investigation

Judge Lord Burns asked Mr McGuire if there had been a time when the letters were examined in the prison.

Mr McGuire said: ""There are two possibilities - the letters and phone recordings were monitored and nothing was done, or they were not monitored.""

A fraudster is still a free man despite owing taxpayers a record £66million that he has failed to pay for a decade, a court has heard.

Gerald Smith, 68, had been ordered to pay £41million under Proceeds of Crime laws for stealing £35million in 2008.

Since then he has allegedly received assets worth £150million but still claims he is unable to settle up.

His debt rises £8,000 a day with interest and the total is three times larger than all illegal cash confiscated by the Metropolitan police in 2016-17.

Yet Smith – jailed at the time for eight years – recently spent £500,000 on a chandelier and £166,000 on flights, Folkestone magistrates heard. Kennedy Talbot, QC, for the Serious Fraud Office, said: “It’s extraordinary for a man who asserts he has no assets.”

Flights included two trips to Dubai at £84,000, £26,000 on a Vancouver flight, and a £24,000 Hong Kong visit.

Mr Talbot added: “Those sums are quite extraordinary and demand an explanation but you haven’t been given one...Where are the funds?”

Mr Talbot also said Smith had a Jersey mansion valued at £12 million.

And properties allegedly bought with stolen money included 14 flats in London, worth £16 million; two villas in Mallorca worth £5 million; land in Italy and a ski lodge in Whistler, Canada.

Smith was handed assets “worth £150 million,” from F1 investor Andy Ruhan in 2016, the court heard.

Yet Smith has only paid back £4million of his debt. Mr Talbot said Smith had shown “wilful refusal and culpable neglect” by failing to repay the cash and urged the court to consider jailing him.

Smith has claimed he wants to pay but is unable to do so because his wealth is tied up in assets he cannot access owing to ongoing complex civil litigation.

The former chief executive of the top-performing New York Stock Exchange company in 1996 was ordered held without bail Friday on charges of insider trading, manipulating his company’s inventory and securities fraud.

Emanuel Pinez, 58, an Israeli citizen who has homes in Canada, Switzerland and suburban Boston, was until Tuesday the head of Centennial Technologies Inc., which saw its stock price increase 450% during the year to reach $58.25.

Before his firing Tuesday, Pinez apparently told the company’s board of directors that he inflated the amount of inventory sold, and he admitted advancing his own money to customers to buy the inventory, the U.S. attorney in Boston said.

The exchange halted trading in the stock of the personal computer card maker Tuesday, shortly before the firm said it had fired Pinez. Company shares have not traded since Monday, when it closed at $16.375.

Analysts expect the stock to open in the single digits when and if trading resumes.

FBI agents arrested Pinez at his Beverly, Mass., home early Friday after the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a complaint alleging he “shorted” his former company.

The federal complaint alleges that Pinez bought and sold more than 4,400 option contracts at a time when he had orchestrated a number of accounting improprieties that were being investigated by the company’s board of directors.

Beginning Feb. 7, Pinez allegedly started buying put options and selling call options to expire on March 21, the complaint said. Call options give an investor the right to buy a stock at a certain price, while put options allow the sale at a certain price.

The SEC said Pinez’s minimum profit on the call options will be $447,500.

U.S. Magistrate Lawrence Cohen ordered Pinez detained, froze his assets and set a hearing date of Tuesday.",arrest on fraud

R. Alexander Acosta, United States Attorney for the Southern District of Florida, and Jonathan I. Solomon, Special Agent in Charge, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Miami Field Office, announced that defendant Eugenio Montoya Sanchez, a/k/a “Hector Fabio Carvajal,” was sentenced earlier today by U.S. District Judge Cecilia M. Altonaga to a term of imprisonment of 360 months (30 years), to be followed by five years of supervised release. Judge Altonaga deferred final determination of restitution until July 10, 2009 at 8:30 a.m.

Montoya Sanchez’s sentence follows his guilty plea on January 23, 2009, to conspiring to import cocaine into the U.S., in violation of Title 21, United States Code, Section 963; and obstruction of justice by murder, in violation of Title 18,United States Code, Sections 1503 and 1111.

As set forth in a written statement of facts submitted to the Court in conjunction with defendant Montoya Sanchez’s guilty plea, defendant Montoya Sanchez was a high-ranking member of the Colombian-based North Valley Cartel cocaine trafficking organization led by his brother, co-defendant and former FBI top-ten most wanted fugitive Diego Montoya Sanchez. Starting in the early 1990s, defendant Eugenio Montoya Sanchez assumed primary responsibility for managing Montoya organization drug finances. His role in this regard included maintaining and overseeing Montoya organization stash houses used to store cash drug proceeds.

According to the written statement of facts, the Montoya organization often maintained between $18 million and $20 million in cash drug proceeds collectively in its stash houses around Colombia, sometimes storing as much as between $6 million and $8 million in a single stash house. Defendant Eugenio Montoya Sanchez used organization drug proceeds to fund the organization’s cocaine laboratories and pay an array of employees, including lab workers, cocaine transporters, and personnel who provided security and debt collection. He also invested drug proceeds in real estate and outside businesses.

In 1999, Die go Montoya Sanchez was indicted in the Southern District of Florida, and the charges were made public in 2000. Starting in approximately 2003, defendant Eugenio Montoya Sanchez added to his duties by coordinating the shipment of multiple organization cocaine loads.

In early August 2003, Montoya organization operatives ambushed and murdered Jhon Jairo Garcia Giraldo, a/k/a “Dos Mil.” Prior to his murder, Garcia Giraldo had obtained and distributed cell phones and pagers for the Montoya organization. Fearing that Garcia Giraldo was cooperating with U.S. law enforcement, Diego Montoya Sanchez directed defendant Eugenio Montoya Sanchez to instruct a Montoya organization member to ambush Garcia Giraldo and beat information from him, particularly whether he was cooperating with authorities and what he had told them. Eugenio Montoya Sanchez conveyed the instructions to the organization member at a meeting in which they also discussed a strategy to lure Garcia Giraldo to a remote meeting location where they would abduct and interrogate him. Because of the Montoya organization’s practice of interrogating and then killing those who they feared were cooperating with authorities, defendant Eugenio Montoya Sanchez knew that the likely consequence was that Garcia Giraldo would be killed. Garcia Giraldo was successfully lured to a farm in a rural area outside of Cali, Colombia, where he was interrogated, beaten, and eventually killed. After the murder, the assailants disposed of Garcia Giraldo’s remains in a river.

Eugenio Montoya Sanchez is the third Montoya family member to be convicted in this case. In 2005, the defendant's brother, co-defendant Juan Carlos Montoya Sanchez, and his cousin, co-defendant Carlos Felipe Toro Sanchez, were extradited to South Florida. In November 2005, both pled guilty to conspiring to import cocaine into the U.S. and subsequently were sentenced to terms of imprisonment of 21and 19 years, respectively. Diego Montoya Sanchez was extradited to South Florida on December 12, 2008, and is pending trial before Judge Altonaga.

Three additional co-defendants in the case were apprehended in Colombia in 2008 and are pending extradition to the United States. Gildardo Rodriguez Herrera, a/k/a “Camisa Roja,” a/k/a “Camisa,” a/k/a “El Señor de la Camisa,” a/k/a “Urley Mena Rosales,” was captured on May 17, 2008. Jorge Ivan Urdinola Perea, a/k/a “Iguana,” a/k/a “Raul,” a/k/a “Don Raul,” was captured on June 25, 2008. Oscar Varela Garcia, a/k/a “Omar Garcia Varela,” a/k/a “Capachivo,” was captured on July 5, 2008.

Mr. Acosta commended the investigative efforts of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. In addition, Mr. Acosta thanked the Colombian government and all police departments involved for their cooperation and invaluable assistance in this matter. Mr. Acosta also thanked the Department of Justice’s Office of International Affairs for its assistance. The case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Davis.

TMML2024039664368,Elliot Morley,"Alert ID: TMML2024039664368
Former Labour minister Elliot Morley has become the highest-profile parliamentarian to be jailed over the expenses scandal after he was sentenced to 16 months' imprisonment for claiming more than £30,000 in false mortgage payments.

The 58-year-old former MP for Scunthorpe, who had admitted two charges of false accounting, was told he was guilty of ""blatant dishonesty"" and had ""thrown away his good name and good character"" in a fraud which ended ""a distinguished political career"" that spanned more than 20 years.

Sentencing him at Southwark crown court, Mr Justice Saunders described Morley's public downfall as ""tragic"".

Morley, who is diabetic and suffers from depression, had earlier wiped away tears as the court heard he had made a ""grotesque error of judgment"". He could be released on licence in four months.

""He had given honourable service to the public, not just to constituents but to the country as whole,"" said Jim Sturman, QC, defending. He had ""discharged onerous ministerial duties for almost a decade"". But now he faced ""a bleak and very uncertain future, especially at his age"".

He had also been stripped of a £64,000 resettlement grant he would normally receive on leaving parliament.

Peter Wright, for the prosecution, said Morley had ""engaged in the wholesale abuse of the expenses system"".

The court was told that, between May 2004 and November 2007, Morley had ""on no fewer than 40 occasions"" falsely claimed £800 a month. Parliamentary rules entitled him to claim only mortgage payment interest on his second home. But while his interest varied from £52 per month in 2004 to £5.85 in February 2006, he continued to claim £800 a month.

He sought £15,200 in mortgage claims, when he was only entitled to £1,572. Between March 2006 and November 2007, after his mortgage had been repaid, he continued to submit the £800 monthly, claiming £16,800 towards a mortgage that did not exist.

He failed to respond to requests for further information from the Fees Office and ""evaded giving answers in the knowledge that to give truthful answers would reveal the fraud"", said Saunders.

When he was eventually challenged, he described it as an ""embarrassing and inadvertent oversight"" and immediately repaid the money.

Morley, who lost his post as environment minister in 2006, stood in the dock as the judge told him that in common with other MPs convicted over expenses, he was guilty of a ""serious breach of trust"". It was "" arguably worse"" in his case because he was a minister.

The judge was satisfied the ""excessive claims were made deliberately and are not explicable even in part by oversight"".

He allowed a 25% discount of the sentence because of the ""courage"" it had taken for Morley to enter a guilty plea. He avoided a longer sentence, despite claiming more money than other MPs convicted, because ""the degree of sophistication"" involved in the fraud was less.

The judge also made ""some small further reduction"" in sentence in light of Morley's public service. He had read ""a truly remarkable series of testimonials"" from many distinguished people describing him as a ""positive force for good""",mortgage fraud

The wife of ex-Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak has been charged with money laundering and tax evasion, as part of an investigation into a massive corruption scandal.

Rosmah Mansor, who is known for her love of luxury goods and jewellery, pleaded not guilty to all 17 charges.

Her husband, Mr Najib, has been accused of pocketing $700m (£517m) from state development fund 1MDB.

Mr Najib currently faces 32 different charges in relation to 1MDB.

Ms Rosmah smiled, wave and blew kisses at the media as she arrived in a Kuala Lumpur court on Thursday.

The 66-year-old had spent a night in detention following her arrest by anti-corruption officials on Wednesday.

Bail for Ms Rosmah was set at 2m ringgit ($483,200; £373,127). Prosecutors had originally sought 10m ringgit in bail.

Mr Najib also appeared at another courtroom in Kuala Lumpur on Thursday for a separate pre-trial hearing.

1MDB, set up by Mr Najib in 2009, was meant to turn Kuala Lumpur into a financial hub and boost the economy through strategic investments.

But it started to attract negative attention in early 2015 after it missed payments for some of the $11bn it owed to banks and bondholders.

Then the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported it had seen a paper trail that allegedly traced close to $700m from the fund to Mr Najib's personal bank accounts.

Mr Najib has consistently denied taking money from 1MDB or any public funds.

The scandal was a key issue in May's elections, which Mr Najib lost to his former mentor Mahathir Mohamad.","money laundering, tax evasion"

MEXICO CITY — In some of the most explosive accusations in recent Mexican political history, the former head of the state-owned oil company directly accused former President Enrique Peña Nieto and his treasury secretary of directing a scheme of kickbacks and embezzlement directly from the president’s office.

Emilio Lozoya, the former head of Petroleos Mexicanos who himself faces corruption charges, alleges Peña Nieto and Luis Videgaray used the state-owned Pemex as a conduit to “fulfill promises made during the (2012) campaign,” among other allegations he makes in a leaked 60-page document whose authenticity was confirmed by Mexican authorities Wednesday.

“Enrique Peña Nieto and Luis Videgaray Caso created a scheme of corruption in the federal government, in which the common denominator was that all the people who supported in some way the presidential campaign had to be recompensed or repaid,” usually in the form of cushy government contracts, Lozoya wrote.

Lozoya also accused Peña Nieto and Videgaray of extortion, fraud and embezzlement.

“The president and the afore-mentioned treasury secretary used me to create a criminal conspiracy aimed at enriching themselves, not only by (taking) government funds, but also by extorting money from individuals and companies, fraud and deceit,” he wrote.

The Associated Press obtained a copy of Lozoya’s testimony, and its authenticity was confirmed first by two people with knowledge of the investigation and then by the federal Attorney General’s Office.

Lozoya was captured in southern Spain in February and extradited to Mexico in July to face charges he took over $4 million in bribes from Brazilian construction giant Odebrecht. But Mexican prosecutors announced they had reached an agreement with Lozoya in which he could avoid jail in return for testifying about corruption in Peña Nieto’s 2012-2018 administration.

Lozoya worked as international relations coordinator of Peña Nieto’s campaign in 2012, and he told investigators the bribes paid by Odebrecht to Mexican officials were aimed at not only winning more lucrative public works contracts for the construction giant, but also at influencing Mexico’s planned sweeping energy reform, enacted once Peña Nieto was in office.

Lozoya’s job on the campaign was to obtain funding from foreign companies that could be used to pay foreign and Mexican consultants and to help position Peña Nieto’s image internationally.

In early 2012, Videgaray, who was Peña Nieto’s campaign manager, allegedly told Lozoya to request $6 million from Odebrecht and tell the company it would be rewarded when Peña Nieto won. Part of that reward would presumably be the openings for private companies contained in the 2013 energy reform of the state-controlled sector.

“As part of the approval of the Pact for Mexico reforms, Enrique Pena Nieto and Luis Videgaray Caso told me in February 2013 that large quantities of money would have to be paid to the opposition so that they would vote in favor of certain structural reforms of interest for President Enrique Pena Nieto,” Lozoya wrote. The cash was to be distributed in transparent plastic bags, so the politicians could see the bills, and in fact a video leaked earlier this week showed one such transaction.

Lozoya named at least a dozen leading opposition figures as participating in bribes, including the 2018 presidential candidate of Peña Nieto’s party, José Antonio Meade, who had enjoyed a friendly relationship López Obrador. Lozoya said about $300,000 was given to Meade and other politicians.

Meade wrote in his Twitter account Wednesday: “I will not contribute to media scandals ... I have devoted my public life to building a better country, always with absolute honor and legality.”

The opposition politicians mentioned by Lozoya include a half dozen former senators, among them the current governor of the border state of Tamaulipas, Francisco García Cabeza de Vaca. Lozoya also accused then-congressman Ricardo Anaya, who went on to become the 2018 presidential candidate for the conservative National Action Party, and other leading National Action figures.

Lozoya said former President Carlos Salinas de Gortari also participated, allegedly acting on behalf of National Action, known as the PAN, though the ex-president was a member of Peña Nieto’s Institutional Revolutionary Party. Lozoya wrote that “the attitude of the PAN members in obtaining resources (money) was brutal,” and that the party’s members received about $4 million in bribes from one company.

There has been wide speculation the case will tar the opposition of current President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, who has termed the case a “historic” step in his fight against corruption.

National Action responded in a statement Wednesday that “Emilio Lozoya is a strategic ally of the president to denigrate the PAN, because it is an alternative to the failure” of López Obrador’s policies.

“Regarding the leaked testimony, we repeat our stance: if there is compelling evidence, we will take compelling action,” the party stated, a reference to previous promises to expel any member caught in acts of corruption.

Neither Videgaray nor his assistant at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have responded to emails seeking comment. Peña Nieto’s former chief of staff also did not respond. The Tamaulipas governor, García Cabeza de Vaca, did not respond to an email seeking comment.

Lozoya said Peña Nieto and Videgaray personally questioned him about a deal to buy an outdated fertilizer plant at an excessive price from one private company, asking him in a meeting at the president’s office in 2013 “why is it taking so long.”

He said the two were particularly interested in the deal and that Videgaray rushed through a review of the deal and told him not to worry about the price being paid, which ended up being several times the plant’s real value. Lozoya said he was “surprised” by their level of interest in the deal, and said Peña Nieto and Videgaray negotiated the purchase with the plant’s owner.

“It was evident that Luis Videgaray Caso had a personal interest in getting the deal done, either because he would obtain some possible illicit benefit, or to pay off favors from the past.”

It was an apparent attempt by Lozoya to shift the blame from himself.

According to charges filed against Lozoya earlier this year, the Mexican firm, Altos Hornos de Mexico, sold the overpriced old fertilizer plant to Pemex after allegedly paying Lozoya around $3.4 million in bribes 2012. According to prosecutors, the money went though accounts controlled by Lozoya and his sister, and they used most of it to buy a house in an upscale neighborhood in the capital.

In the testimony, Lozoya claimed he was “intimidated” into signing off on the purchase of the fertilizer plant, known as Agronitrogenados, by the president and Videgaray.

“Luis Videgaray Caso took over leadership of the decisions regarding the purchase of Agronitrogenados, arguing, and I quote ‘This is the president’s business, you just do what you are told. I speak for him.’”

Lozoya even suggested the bribery and kickback scheme was meant to finance future campaigns by the Institutional Revolutionary Party, which governed Mexico for 70 years in the 20th century and returned to power in 2012 after a 12-year absence.

“Sometimes they (businessmen) had to give money back after the deals to benefit future PRI electoral campaigns, or for the personal benefit of Enrique Peña Nieto and Luis Videgaray Caso,” according to the document.",corruption

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazilian prosecutors filed charges against the country’s Agriculture Minister Blairo Maggi on Wednesday, accusing him of orchestrating a bribery scheme in 2009 when he was governor of Mato Grosso state.

Prosecutor General Raquel Dodge filed charges at the Supreme Court, according to a written statement from the federal prosecutor’s office.

Maggi denies any wrongdoing, said the press office of the agriculture minister in a written statement.

Under Brazilian law, Maggi, as a government minister, can only face a trial if the Supreme Court approves it. There was no indication on Wednesday as to when the court would make a decision.

Dodge accused Maggi of participating in a scheme to pay a judge on the Mato Grosso state audit court 12 million reais ($3.4 million) in public funds to retire, so that Sergio Ricardo de Almeida, who was a Mato Grosso state lawmaker, could take the post, which he did.

Almeida was removed from the court last year and faces a trial in a lower-level federal court in connection with the supposed scheme.

SAN DIEGO ­– Bing Han and Lei Zhang pleaded guilty in federal court today for operating unlicensed money transmitting businesses. Their guilty pleas are believed to be the first in the United States for a developing form of unlawful underground financial institution that transfers money between the United States and China, thereby circumventing domestic and foreign laws regarding monetary transfers and reporting, including United States anti-money laundering scrutiny and Chinese capital flight controls.

Special Agents from Homeland Security Investigations, IRS Criminal Investigation Las Vegas Financial Crimes Task Force, and the Drug Enforcement Administration led the investigation into Han’s and Zhang’s financial operations. As admitted in the plea agreements entered today before U.S. Magistrate Judge William V. Gallo, Han and Zhang would collect U.S. dollars (in cash) from various third-parties in the United States and deliver that cash to a customer, typically a gambler from China who could not readily access cash in the United States due to capital controls that limit the amount of Chinese yuan an individual can convert to foreign currency at $50,000 per year. Upon receipt of the U.S. dollars, the customer (i.e., the gambler) would transfer the equivalent value of yuan (using banking apps on their cell phones in the United States) from the customer’s Chinese bank account to a Chinese bank account designated by defendant Han or Zhang. For facilitating these transactions, Zhang and Han were paid a commission based on the monetary value illegally transferred.

U.S. Attorney Robert S. Brewer, Jr. said, “The United States stands vigilant against the constantly evolving ways in which individuals and organizations seek to operate outside the conventional financial system. Violating United States anti-money laundering laws not only endangers the integrity of the global financial system, but doing so hinders the ability of law enforcement officers to confront criminal conduct including money laundering and narcotics trafficking.”

Han and Zhang further admitted today that they were regularly introduced to customers by casino hosts, who sought to increase the gambling play of the casino’s customers. By connecting cash-starved gamblers in the United States with illicit money transmitting businesses, like those operated by Han and Zhang, the casinos increased the domestic cash play of their China-based customers. All a gambler needed was a mobile device that had remote access a China-based bank account. As a result, Han and Zhang managed to transmit and convert electronic funds in China into hard currency in the United States; all while circumventing the obstacles imposed both by China’s capital controls, and the anti-money laundering scrutiny imposed on all United States financial institutions. For their efforts, the casino hosts often received a cut of Han’s or Zhang’s commission.

“This case demonstrates that those who attempt to use underground or unregulated money transfer systems cannot evade detection and punishment,” said Cardell T. Morant, acting Special Agent in Charge for HSI San Diego. “HSI and our domestic and foreign partners will continue to work together aggressively to investigate and prosecute those who seek to hide their involvement in transnational crime by employing such international money laundering schemes.”

“Criminals keep trying to find ways to circumvent our financial system by laundering money,” said Tara Sullivan, Special Agent in Charge of IRS Criminal Investigation Las Vegas. “Unfortunately for Han and Zhang, the IRS Criminal Investigation Las Vegas Financial Crimes Task Force was relentless in seeking out and disrupting their underground banking network and will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to uphold anti-money laundering laws”.

“Although Mr. Han and Mr. Zhang did not admit to transacting narcotics proceeds in their unlicensed money transmitting businesses, we know that drug trafficking organizations are willing to use a variety of businesses to launder proceeds from the sales of drugs,” said DEA Special Agent in Charge John W. Callery. “DEA and our outstanding partners will continue to investigate illicit financial transactions and anyone who may operate businesses that stand to profit from illegal drug sales.”

U.S. Attorney Brewer commended the diligence and dedication of Assistant U.S. Attorneys Daniel Silva and Mark W. Pletcher, the prosecutors on this case. Sentencing for Mr. Han is scheduled to occur on May 1, 2020 before Hon. Janis L. Sammartino. Sentencing for Mr. Zhang is scheduled to occur on May 4, 2020 before Hon. William Q. Hayes. Han and Zhang both face a maximum of 5 years in prison.

Casino operator Wynn Resorts has added three women to its board, amid allegations of sexual misconduct by its former chief executive Steve Wynn.

The company said the appointments were a ""first step"" in efforts to refresh and diversify its board.

Shareholders are currently suing Wynn's board over claims it knew of the allegations against Mr Wynn for years and failed to investigate.

Mr Wynn has denied any wrongdoing and called the allegations ""preposterous"".

Wynn Resorts said Betsy Atkins, Dee Dee Myers and Wendy Webb had been appointed as independent directors, effective immediately, bringing its board numbers to 11.

""The Wynn Resorts board now comprises 36% women, bringing Wynn into the top 40 S&P 500 companies in terms of female board representation,"" the company said in a statement.

Ms Myers was the first woman to serve as the White House press secretary, a position she held during President Clinton's first term and is now an executive at Warner Bros.

Ms Webb's background includes some 20 years as a senior executive at The Walt Disney Company, while Betsy Atkins is an expert in corporate governance.

""To be clear, this is the first step in our effort to refresh the board,"" said chairman D Boone Wayson. ""We intend to add additional new directors in the coming months.""

U.S. authorities have successfully prosecuted an illegal Las Vegas money transfer scheme that used a method similar to one in B.C.

Canadian authorities have been criticized for their tepid money-laundering prosecution record, including in late 2017 when a major money-laundering case collapsed in British Columbia.

article continues below

It used the same method cited in the Las Vegas case. That method — where cash is given gamblers in exchange for money in a Chinese bank — had been dubbed the “Vancouver model” by an Australian academic.

On Feb. 3, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of California announced that Bing Han and Lei Zhang pleaded guilty in Federal Court for operating unlicensed money transmitting businesses.

The pair face a maximum five years in prison.

In statement, the U.S. Attorney’s Office said the guilty pleas are believed to be the first in the U.S. for a form of unlawful underground banking that transfers money between the U.S. and China that circumvents domestic and foreign laws. Chinese citizens are only allowed to transfer US$50,000 a year out of that country.

B.C. Attorney General David Eby, who has been a critic of Canada’s money-laundering prosecutions, said the similarities in the Las Vegas and Vancouver cases and their different prosecution outcomes are striking. “Americans seem to be more than willing to use their tax system and their anti-money-laundering system to support aggressive prosecutions, and Canadians simply don’t,” Eby said.

Eby has been pushing the Trudeau government for a boost in investigations and prosecution capacity, which he says has not materialized .

Queen’s University law professor Arthur Cockfield said that Canada has some successful prosecutions for international money laundering but most of them collapse.

“It’s a real problem,” he said.

It is complex to prosecute money laundering, but this American prosecution shows it is feasible, said Cockfield.

Garry Clement, a former RCMP superintendent who served as national director of the proceeds of crime program, said it is disheartening that prosecutions are possible in the U.S. but not in Canada.

Clement said what is needed is both legislative changes to strengthen Canadian laws against money laundering and more policing resources and expertise.

The investigation into Han and Zhang’s financial operation included special agents from Homeland Security investigations, the Internal Revenue Service’s Las Vegas financial crimes task force and the Drug Enforcement Administration.

The money laundering scheme described in Las Vegas is very similar to the model described by RCMP in court documents of the E-Pirate investigation that alleged an illicit money transfer business in Richmond laundered as much as $220 million in drug trafficking money.

Cash was provided to high stakes gamblers who used it in Lower Mainland casinos. The gamblers in turn deposited Chinese currency in Chinese banks to pay for the cash.

Those involved in the illicit money-transfer business took a cut of the transfers, similar to the cut taken by the Las Vegas money transferers, according to the plea agreement filed in U.S. court.

Han, for example, received a five per cent fee.

According to the plea agreement filed in U.S. District Court, Han collected U.S. dollars in cash and delivered the cash to gamblers from China.

The gambler would transfer an equivalent value of currency from the gamblers’ Chinese bank to an account designated by Han.",money laundering

Action Builds on Treasury’s Targeted Campaign Against the Camorra, the Yakuza, the Brothers’ Circle, and MS-13

WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of the Treasury today took additional action against four transnational criminal organizations (TCOs): the Camorra, the Yakuza, the Brothers’ Circle, and Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13). Today’s designations include seven members of the Camorra, one of Europe's largest criminal organizations; the Kudo-kai, a violent syndicate within the Japanese Yakuza criminal network along with two of its leaders; an individual known to act on behalf of the Brothers’ Circle, a large multi-ethnic Eurasian criminal network; and one member of MS-13, a criminal street gang that operates internationally. These designations were imposed under Executive Order (E.O.) 13581, “Blocking Property of Transnational Criminal Organizations,” which targets significant TCOs and individuals or entities determined to have provided material support to, or to be owned or controlled by, or to have acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, such organizations.

President Obama identified the Camorra, the Yakuza, and the Brothers’ Circle, along with the Zetas, as significant TCOs in the Annex to E.O. 13581 on July 24, 2011. Pursuant to this E.O., the Treasury Department has imposed additional sanctions against their members and supporters to undermine and interdict their global criminal operations. The Treasury Department subsequently designated MS-13 as a significant TCO pursuant to E.O. 13581 on October 11, 2012.

Today’s action freezes any assets the designated persons may have within the jurisdiction of the United States and generally prohibits any transactions with them by U.S. persons.

“Those sanctioned today support some of the most violent and destructive criminal organizations in the world. From trafficking in illegal drugs, weapons, and human beings, to laundering the proceeds of their illegal acts, these organizations endanger innocent lives and compromise legitimate businesses,” said Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence David S. Cohen. “Treasury will continue to protect the U.S. and international financial system by exposing and disrupting these groups and those who support them, wherever they may be.”

The Camorra

The Italian Camorra operates internationally and is involved in serious criminal activity such as money laundering, drug trafficking, extortion, alien smuggling, robbery, blackmail, kidnapping, political corruption, and counterfeiting. Although the group is based in Naples, Italy, the negative effects from the organization’s illicit activities have been recognized throughout Italy. Italian law enforcement continues to combat, disrupt, and dismantle this criminal organization, and has conducted multiple operations within the past year to seize Camorra assets, including a single-day seizure of assets worth 450 million Euro from the Camorra’s Casalesi clan in June 2013. Including today’s action, the Treasury Department has designated fourteen individuals affiliated with the Camorra under E.O. 13581.

The individuals designated today for acting for or on behalf of the Camorra were defendants in the famous Spartacus trial held in Italy against the powerful Casalesi clan from Casal di Principe, a town outside of Naples, Italy. They include Francesco Bidognetti and Francesco “Sandokan” Schiavone, two bosses of the Casalesi clan, who received life sentences following their conviction for crimes including murder, assault, and extortion. Two other bosses of the Casalesi clan involved in the Spartacus trial, Antonio Iovine and Michele Zagaria, were designated under E.O. 13581 on August 1, 2012. The other five individuals designated today for acting for or on behalf of the Camorra, Francesco Barbato, Nicola Panaro, Sebastiano Panaro, Nicola Schiavone, and Vincenzo Schiavone, are all high-level members of the Casalesi clan. Francesco Barbato and Nicola Panaro were convicted of extortion; Sebastiano Panaro was convicted of extortion, mafia association, and murder; Vincenzo Schiavone was convicted of mafia association and extortion; and Nicola Schiavone was convicted of triple homicide.

The Yakuza

The Yakuza, reputedly the world’s largest criminal organization with close to 60,000 members, is involved in serious criminal activities, including weapons trafficking, prostitution, human trafficking, drug trafficking, fraud, and money laundering. Including today’s action, the Treasury Department has designated twelve individuals affiliated with the Yakuza and four Yakuza syndicates: the Yamaguchi-gumi, Sumiyoshi-kai, Inagawa-kai, and the Kudo-kai.

The Kudo-kai, which the Treasury Department is designating today for acting for or on behalf of the Yakuza, is reportedly the most violent Yakuza syndicate. The Kudo-kai is headquartered in Fukuoka, Japan and has approximately 950 members, including associate members.

Today, the Treasury Department is also designating Satoru Nomura, the President of the Kudo-kai, as well as the Kudo-kai Chief, Fumio Tanoue, for acting for or on behalf of the Kudo-kai. As Kudo-kai leaders, Nomura and Tanoue are responsible for the group’s operations, including relaying and enforce orders, conducting personnel changes, and promoting Kudo-kai members to lead their own subsidiary groups.

The Brothers’ Circle

The Brothers’ Circle is a multi-ethnic criminal group made up of leaders and senior members of several Eurasian criminal groups largely based in countries of the former Soviet Union but also operating in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America. The Brothers’ Circle serves as a coordinating body for several criminal networks, mediating disputes between the individual criminal networks and directing member criminal activity globally. Including today’s action, the Treasury Department has designated 23 individuals and six entities affiliated with the Brothers’ Circle.

Today, the Treasury Department is designating Adam Sultanovich Delimkhanov, a member of the Russian Duma, pursuant to E.O. 13581 for acting for or on behalf of Gafur Rakhimov, a key member of the Brothers’ Circle designated by the Treasury Department in February 2012.

Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13)

In October 2012, MS-13 became the first transnational criminal street gang to be designated by Treasury as a significant TCO. MS-13 has been involved in serious criminal activity in the United States and around the world, including human smuggling, sex trafficking, drug trafficking, kidnapping, murder, assassinations, racketeering, blackmail, extortion, and immigration offenses. Including today’s action, Treasury has designated seven individuals affiliated with MS-13.

Today, the Treasury Department is designating Jenny Judith Corado Portillo pursuant to E.O. 13581 for acting for or on behalf of MS-13, and Borromeo Enrique Henriquez Solorzano, an MS-13 leader designated by the Treasury Department on June 5, 2013. This action was supported extensively by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Homeland Security Investigations directorate. Jenny Judith Corado Portillo is a member of the Big Gangster Locos Salvatruchas MS-13 clique in El Salvador and the common-law wife of incarcerated MS-13 spokesperson Borromeo Enrique Henriquez Solorzano. Jenny Judith Corado Portillo was arrested in May 2013 on charges of extortion. It is believed she acts as an intermediary for her incarcerated husband Borromeo Enrique Henriquez Solorzano.

February 27, 2014 - Treasury Sanctions Key Sinaloa Cartel Network

The U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) today announced the designation of Hugo Cuellar Hurtado, a dual Colombian-Mexican national, for his material support to the narcotics trafficking activities of the Sinaloa Cartel and one of the organization’s leaders, Juan Jose Esparragoza Moreno (a.k.a. El Azul), pursuant to the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act (Kingpin Act). Six other individuals and ten entities linked to Cuellar Hurtado were also designated. As a result of today’s action, all property and interests in property in the United States, or in the possession or control of U.S. persons in which the individuals and entities designated today have an interest, are blocked, and U.S. persons are generally prohibited from engaging in transactions with them.

The President identified Esparragoza Moreno and the Sinaloa Cartel as significant foreign narcotics traffickers pursuant to the Kingpin Act in 2003 and 2009, respectively. Esparragoza Moreno was indicted on drug trafficking charges in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas in 2003 and is wanted in both the U.S. and Mexico. On February 22, 2014, Mexican authorities captured Joaquin Guzman Loera (a.k.a. El Chapo) – the reputed leader of the Sinaloa Cartel and considered to be among the most wanted criminals in the world. Guzman Loera was identified by the President as a significant foreign narcotics trafficker pursuant to the Kingpin Act in 2001.

“Mexican authorities achieved a major victory with the capture of Chapo Guzman. Building on this success, OFAC will continue targeting the finances and operations of the Sinaloa Cartel and its other leaders, including Esparragoza Moreno,” said OFAC Director Adam J. Szubin. “Today’s action marks the next step in this effort by targeting Hugo Cuellar Hurtado, who poses as a businessman involved in enterprises ranging from ostrich farming to pawn shops. In reality, Cuellar Hurtado is a longtime criminal who supports illicit drug trafficking activities and promotes organized crime.”

Cuellar Hurtado has been engaged in drug trafficking activities for decades. He previously worked for the Medellín drug cartel and shipped cocaine to the United States through Mexico. In the late 1990s, Cuellar Hurtado began living part time in Mexico and eventually began supplying cocaine to the Sinaloa Cartel.

Today’s designation also targets six other individuals, including five of Cuellar Hurtado’s family members. John Fredy Cuellar Silva, the son of Cuellar Hurtado, acts on his father’s behalf and is also providing support to the Sinaloa Cartel’s drug trafficking activities. The other family members were designated today because they act on behalf of Cuellar Hurtado and/or John Fredy Cuellar Silva: Ofelia Margarita Miramontes Gutierrez (Cuellar Hurtado’s current wife), Jenny Johanna Cuellar Silva (Cuellar Hurtado’s daughter), Victor Hugo Cuellar Silva (Cuellar Hurtado’s son), and Gabriela Amarillas Lopez (Cuellar Hurtado’s daughter-in-law). Also designated today is Lucy Amparo Vargas Nunez, who manages Cuellar Hurtado’s assets in Colombia.

The entities designated today include four Mexican companies. Agricola y Ganadera Cuemir and Cooperativa Avestruz Cuemir are located in Tlajomulco de Zuniga, Jalisco, which is near Guadalajara. These companies are engaged in ostrich farming and the breeding of Friesian horses. Casa de Empeno Guadalajara (a.k.a. Empenos Prestafacil) and Prenda Todo (a.k.a. Casa de Empeno Prenda Todo) are both pawn shop companies in Guadalajara.

Further, six Colombian companies were also designated. Agro y Comercio de Santa Barbara Lagromer, Compania Agro Comercial Cueta, and Inversiones Hunel Ltda. are all agricultural companies based in Bogotá. Casa Comercial Oro Rapido, of Girardot, Cundinamarca, and Casa Comercial Uni Quince, of Bogota, are both pawn shops. Hotel Paraiso Resort en Arrendamiento is a lodging establishment located in Rivera, Huila.

Today’s action was taken in close coordination with the Drug Enforcement Administration.

Internationally, OFAC has designated more than 1,300 businesses and individuals linked to 103 drug kingpins since June 2000. Penalties for violations of the Kingpin Act range from civil penalties of up to $1.075 million per violation to more severe criminal penalties. Criminal penalties for corporate officers may include up to 30 years in prison and fines up to $5 million. Criminal fines for corporations may reach $10 million. Other individuals could face up to 10 years in prison and fines pursuant to Title 18 of the United States Code for criminal violations of the Kingpin Act.

January 16, 2014 - Treasury Continues Targeting Sinaloa Cartel Leadership

​Action Targets Senior Lieutenant of Ismael “Mayo” Zambada Garcia, responsible for Narcotics Transportation

The U.S. Department of the Treasury today announced the designation of Jose Guadalupe Tapia Quintero, a Culiacan, Sinaloa, Mexico based senior lieutenant of the Sinaloa Cartel. Jose Guadalupe Tapia Quintero was designated for his role in the drug trafficking activities of Ismael “Mayo” Zambada Garcia and for playing a significant role in international drug trafficking.

“We will continue to target all aspects of the Sinaloa Cartel,” said Treasury’s Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) Adam J. Szubin. “Our actions will focus on the financial nerve points as well as the underlying logistics that are essential to the cartel’s day-to-day operations, such as the transportation network that we are taking action against today.”

Tapia Quintero oversees the transportation of cocaine and marijuana for the Zambada Garcia drug trafficking organization and is responsible for coordinating the purchase and transportation of cocaine and methamphetamine from Sinaloa into the U.S., specifically Arizona and California, on a monthly basis. Tapia Quintero also transports methamphetamine on behalf of a drug trafficking cell affiliated with Joaquin “Chapo” Guzman Loera from Sinaloa to Tijuana, Baja California via tractor trailers. The President identified Joaquin Guzman Loera, Ismael Zambada Garcia, and the Sinaloa Cartel as significant foreign narcotics traffickers pursuant to the Kingpin Act in 2001, 2002 and 2009, respectively.

Today’s action is taken with the support of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), specifically the Phoenix Field Division, and the multi-agency OCDETF Strike Force.

“DEA and its OFAC partners will not allow these dangerous cartels and their associates to exploit the U.S. financial system,” said DEA Special Agent in Charge Doug Coleman. ""We’re relentlessly following the financial trail to deprive these traffickers of their assets, draining the lifeblood from their criminal enterprises.”

Pursuant to the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act (Kingpin Act), this designation generally prohibits U.S. persons from conducting financial or commercial transactions with Tapia Quintero, and also freezes any assets he may have under U.S. jurisdiction.

Since June 2000, the President has identified 103 drug kingpins, and OFAC has designated more than 1300 entities and individuals, pursuant to the Kingpin Act. Penalties for violations of the Kingpin Act range from civil penalties of up to $1.075 million per violation to more severe criminal penalties. Criminal penalties for corporate officers may include up to 30 years in prison and fines up to $5 million. Criminal fines for corporations may reach $10 million. Other individuals could face up to 10 years in prison and fines pursuant to Title 18 of the United States Code for criminal violations of the Kingpin Act.

October 30, 2013 - Transnational Criminal Organizations Designations

The U.S. Department of the Treasury today designated six individuals and four entities linked to the Brothers’ Circle, a Eurasian crime syndicate, pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 13581, which targets significant transnational criminal organizations (TCOs). Today’s actions are focused on the criminal networks of two key members of the Brothers Circle, Vladislav Leontyev and Gafur Rakhimov, both of whom were designated by the Treasury Department for acting on behalf of the Brothers’ Circle in February 2012. Today’s designations include individuals and businesses in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East working on behalf of Leontyev and Rakhimov and support Treasury’s efforts to disrupt the illicit financial networks that provide revenue and support for their global criminal activities.

“The key to targeting transnational criminal organizations, such as the Brothers’ Circle, is exposing the network behind the group’s leaders, which we have done today. We remain determined to continue our systematic effort to disrupt these networks in order to protect the U.S. financial system from abuse by these criminals,” said Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence David S. Cohen.

The Brothers’ Circle is one of five TCOs sanctioned under E.O. 13581, along with the Camorra, the Yakuza, Los Zetas, and MS-13. Today’s action brings to 28 the total number of individuals and entities designated by the Treasury Department for acting for or on behalf of the Brothers’ Circle.

The Brothers’ Circle is a criminal group composed of leaders and senior members of several Eurasian criminal groups that are largely based in the countries of the former Soviet Union, but which also operate in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America. The Brothers’ Circle serves as a coordinating body for several criminal networks, mediates disputes between individual criminal networks, and directs member criminal activity globally.

Today’s action generally prohibits U.S. persons from conducting financial or commercial transactions with these entities and individuals, and freezes any assets they may have under U.S. jurisdiction.

Targets Linked to Vladislav Leontyev - Vladislav Leontyev was designated by the Treasury Department under E.O. 13581 on February 23, 2012, for acting for or on behalf of the Brothers’ Circle. Vladislav Leontyev is a key member of the Brothers’ Circle and has been involved in various criminal activities, including narcotics trafficking. He was also involved in a shooting between regional factions within Russian organized criminal networks over an attempt to seize control of a local precious metals enterprise. The following individuals were designated today, along with entities they own or control, because they act for or on behalf of Vladislav Leontyev:

Vadim Lyalin serves as a conduit for passing messages on behalf of Vladislav Leontyev;

Grigory Lepsveridze couriers money on behalf of Vladislav Leontyev;

Igor Shlykov has worked to get identification documents and to develop business opportunities in Africa on Vladislav Leontyev’s behalf. Igor Shlykov also owns or controls M S Group Invest OOO and Meridian Jet Management GmbH based in Russia and Austria respectively. He is the director-general of M S Group Invest OOO and owns 60 percent of Meridian Jet Management GmbH;

Gurgen House FZCO is owned or controlled by Lazar Shaybazian who was designated in February 2012, for acting for or on behalf of Vladislav Leontyev. Gurgen House FZCO has offices in the U.A.E., Uzbekistan, and Russia. Lazar Shaybazian uses Gurgen House FZCO to move money.

Targets Linked to Gafur Rakhimov - In February 2012, Gafur Rakhimov was designated by the Treasury Department pursuant to E.O. 13581 for acting on behalf of the Brothers’ Circle. Gafur Rakhimov is a key member of the Brothers’ Circle and one of the leaders of Uzbek organized crime with a specialty in the organized production of drugs in Central Asia. He has operated major international drug syndicates involving the trafficking of heroin. Sergey Moskalenko and Yakov Rybalskiy were designated today by the Treasury Department because they act for or on behalf of Gafur Rakhimov.

Artur Badalyan - Artur Badalyan and his company Fasten Tourism LLC were designed today pursuant to E.O. 13581 because they are used by key members of the Brothers’ Circle to courier money and make travel arrangements. Artur Badalyan is the owner and CEO of Fasten Tourism LLC.

July 24, 2013 - New Sanctions Announced Against the Camorra and the Brothers' Circle

Treasury Designates Members And Supporters of Transnational Criminal Organizations

7/24/2013 New Sanctions Announced Against the Camorra and the Brothers' Circle

WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of the Treasury today designated five members of the Italian Camorra, including the mob boss Marco Di Lauro and the fugitive Mario Riccio, as well as two businesses linked to individuals acting on behalf of a key member of the Brothers' Circle, a large multi-ethnic Eurasian criminal network. These Transnational Criminal Organizations (TCOs) continue to use various methods to conceal the proceeds earned from their illicit activities and maintain access to the international financial system. Today's actions are the latest in the Treasury Department's use of executive authorities to expose, undermine, and disrupt these criminal activities which include: money laundering, extortion, drug trafficking, kidnapping and counterfeiting.

""Today's action against key members of criminal organizations that engage in serious crimes around the world is a continuation of our systematic effort to expose and disrupt these dangerous groups and protect the U.S. financial system from their illicit activity,"" said Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence David S. Cohen.

President Obama identified the Camorra, and the Brothers' Circle, along with the Yakuza and the Zetas, as significant TCOs in the Annex to Executive Order (E.O.) 13581 (Blocking Property of Transnational Criminal Organizations) in July 2011, and he charged the Treasury Department with pursuing additional sanctions against their members and supporters to undermine and interdict their global criminal operations.

Today's action freezes any assets these individuals and businesses may have within the jurisdiction of the United States and generally prohibits any transactions with them by U.S. persons. To date, the Treasury Department has designated 34 individuals and entities related to TCOs and has exposed their activity ranging from Europe to Asia to the Middle East. Treasury will continue to target additional members and supporters of these groups, as well as identify other significant TCOs, such as MS-13 which was named in October 2012, in order to expose and disrupt their criminal operations and protect the U.S. financial system from abuse.

The Camorra - The Camorra operates internationally and is involved in serious criminal activity, such as money laundering, extortion, alien smuggling, robbery, blackmail, kidnapping, political corruption, and counterfeiting. Italian law enforcement has conducted multiple operations this year to seize Camorra assets, including a single-day seizure of 450 million euros from the Casalesi clan in June. To date, Treasury has designated nine individuals affiliated with the Camorra under E.O. 13581.

The Camorra members designated today have all played a role in the recent inter-clan violence that has wreaked havoc on northern Naples. In October 2012, all five were identified by Italian authorities as involved in the murder of a bystander to the feud. Marco Di Lauro has been on Italy's Most Wanted List since 2004 for mafia-related activities. Mario Riccio is involved in a drug trafficking business that nets tens of millions of euros every year. Until his capture in January, Antonio Mennetta was in charge of a group responsible for assassinating enemies of a young splinter clan supported by Di Lauro, the ""Vanella Grassi"" or ""Girati"". Mariano Abete, also currently in jail, was arrested for mafia associated activity and conspiracy to deal drugs. Rosario Guarino, implicated in a dozen murders, was arrested in November 2012 for mafia associated activities and drug trafficking. Each of these five individuals were designated for acting for or on behalf of, or providing material support to, the Camorra.

The Brothers' Circle - The Brothers' Circle is a multi-ethnic criminal group composed of leaders and senior members of several Eurasian criminal groups largely based in countries of the former Soviet Union but extending to Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America. To date, Treasury has designated 16 individuals connected with the Brothers' Circle, including both Brothers' Circle members and their subordinates, under E.O. 13581. These designated individuals include key member Vladislav Leontyev, as well as two individuals acting for or on his behalf, Aleksandr Manuylov and Lazar Shaybazian. Leontyev, Manuylov, and Shaybazian were designated by Treasury in February 2012. Today, Treasury is taking action against the companies Avuar OOO and Guga Arm SRO because they are owned or controlled by Aleksandr Manuylov and Lazar Shaybazian, respectively. Aleksandr Manuylov is the sole director of Avuar OOO while Lazar Shaybazian is the director, sole board member, and 100 percent owner of Guga Arm SRO.

US Department of the Treasury Press Release

July 23, 2013 - Treasury Sanctions Financial Operatives Linked to Los Zetas

The U.S. Department of the Treasury today designated two Mexican nationals, Jose Odilon Ramirez Perales and Ismael Lopez Guerrero, pursuant to the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act (Kingpin Act) for their ties to Mexico’s violent Los Zetas drug trafficking organization.

Ramirez Perales is a powerful financial operative responsible for controlling and laundering tens of millions of dollars in funds smuggled from the U.S. to Mexico for Los Zetas leaders Miguel Trevino Morales and Omar Trevino Morales. Lopez Guerrero collects illicit monies from Los Zetas operations in Nuevo Laredo, and he sends large quantities of smuggled cash to Ramirez Perales for safeguarding and processing in Coahuila, Mexico. “The momentous arrest of Miguel Trevino Morales, who was captured last week, took place in the early morning hours with two of his closest advisors by his side, including a key accountant. This is another clear example of the central importance of financial operatives within the operational structure of drug cartels,” said Treasury’s Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) Adam J. Szubin. “Treasury’s action today targets the activities of two other significant financial operatives for Los Zetas. We will continue to support our Mexican partners to target those laundering Los Zetas’ ill-gotten gains.”

Ramirez Perales is wanted in the Southern District of Texas for money laundering relating to drug trafficking. Ramirez Perales and his other co-defendants are subject to the forfeiture of approximately $20 million in the Southern District of Texas. In October 2012, Mexican authorities captured Ramirez Perales, and they arrested Lopez Guerrero after a July 2012 gun battle. Lopez Guerrero, who uses the alias Gilberto Godina Guerrero, was alleged to possess ammunition, drugs, and currency at the time of his arrest. The arrests of these individuals and other high level Los Zetas members such as Miguel Trevino Morales, along with the death of former Zeta leader Heriberto Lazcano-Lazcano, has played a vital role in weakening of the organization.

Today’s action generally prohibits U.S. persons from engaging in any transactions with these individuals and freezes any assets they may have under U.S. jurisdiction.

The President identified Los Zetas as a significant foreign narcotics trafficker pursuant to the Kingpin Act in April 2009. On July 24, 2011, the President named Los Zetas as a significant Transnational Criminal Organization in the Annex to Executive Order 13581 (Blocking Property of Transnational Criminal Organizations). Additionally, OFAC designated Los Zetas leaders Miguel and Omar Trevino Morales on July 20, 2009 and March 24, 2010, respectively. Since 2009, OFAC has designated several dozen key plaza bosses, drug traffickers, and money launderers operating on behalf of Los Zetas using Kingpin Act authorities.

Internationally, OFAC has designated more than 1,200 individuals and entities linked to 103 drug kingpins since June 2000. OFAC designations are part of an ongoing effort to apply financial measures against significant foreign narcotics traffickers and their organizations worldwide. Penalties for violations of the Kingpin Act range from civil penalties of up to $1.075 million per violation to more severe criminal penalties. Criminal penalties for corporate officers may include up to 30 years in prison and fines up to $5 million. Criminal fines for corporations may reach $10 million. Other individuals face up to 10 years in prison and fines pursuant to Title 18 of the United States Code for criminal violations of the Kingpin Act.

June 05, 2013 - Transnational Criminal Organizations Designations - Mara Salvatrucha Leaders aka MS13

The Mara Salvatrucha gang originated in Los Angeles and has spread to Central America, other parts of the United States, and Canada. It is commonly abbreviated as MS, Mara, and MS-13. There is some dispute about the etymology of the name. The most common belief is that the word ""Mara"" refers to the Spanish word for ""gang"", and ""Salvatrucha"" (which is Spanish slang) for ""Salvadoran army ant"". Alternatively, it is suggested that ""Salvatrucha"" refers to the Salvadoran peasant guerrillas, the source of much of the gang's early manpower. The number 13 is homage to the Los Angeles gang ""Los Emes"" or ""The Ms""(M being the thirteenth letter of the alphabet). The gang was set up in Los Angeles in 1980's by Salvadoran immigrants in the city's Pico-Union neighborhood. Source: Urban Dictionary

June 05, 2013 - Treasury Sanctions Significant Members Of MS-13 - Designation Targets Notorious Gang Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13)

The U.S. Department of the Treasury today designated six members of the notorious El Salvadoran gang Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13) pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 13581, which targets transnational criminal organizations (TCOs) and their supporters. Today's actions, supported extensively by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's (ICE) Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), are part of the Treasury Department's ongoing efforts to target the leadership of global criminal organizations, including MS-13, that threaten innocent people and legitimate business around the world, including in the United States. In October 2012, MS-13 became the first transnational criminal street gang to be designated by Treasury as a TCO. MS-13 has been involved in serious criminal activity, in the United States and around the world, including human smuggling, sex trafficking, drug trafficking, kidnapping, murder, assassinations, racketeering, blackmail, extortion, and immigration offenses.

""MS-13 is an extremely violent and dangerous gang responsible for a multitude of crimes that directly threaten the welfare and security of U.S. citizens, as well as peoples throughout Central America,"" said Adam Szubin, Director of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control. ""We will continue to target the leadership and financial networks supporting MS-13, and work with our law enforcement partners from across the United States and around the world to disrupt their criminal activities.""

""Today's designation of six MS-13 leaders is the result of Homeland Security Investigation's National Gang Unit and OFAC's joint partnership to further strike at the financial heart of one of the most dangerous transnational criminal gangs in the world today,"" said ICE Director John Morton. ""This powerful tool will provide HSI and its local, state, federal and international law enforcement partners to further disrupt MS-13 financial networks and violent operations. ""History has proven that we can successfully take down organized crime groups when we combine sophisticated investigative techniques with tough street level enforcement, cutting off cash flows, contraband and collaborators to ensure they no longer find safe haven in our communities.""

Today's designations of six individuals working for or on behalf of MS-13 are designed to further disrupt the activities of MS-13 and to protect the U.S. and international financial system from abuse. As active members and leaders, these individuals are heavily involved in directing and participating in illicit activity, such as drug trafficking, money laundering, extortion, and murder. Borromeo Enrique Henriquez Solorzano, incarcerated in El Salvador, is widely regarded as the Central American leader of the group and frequently acts as the spokesperson for the MS-13 gang in El Salvador. Several other MS-13 leaders, including Marvin Geovanny Monterrosa Larios, Moises Humberto Rivera Luna, and Saul Antonio Turcios Angel, have been indicted in the United States for racketeering, murder, and other violent crimes. Moris Alexander Bercian Manchon has been involved in narcotics trafficking operations on behalf of the organization and Jose Misael Cisneros Rodriguez is both an MS-13 crime boss and a narcotics trafficker.

MS-13 consists of more than 30,000 members and operates in at least five countries, including the United States. It is one of the most dangerous criminal gangs in the world today. MS-13 promotes its illicit interests through murder, kidnapping, blackmail, extortion, and assassination, including carrying out numerous murders within the United States.

U.S. persons and businesses are generally prohibited from engaging in any transactions with the individuals designated today, and any assets of those designees subject to U.S. jurisdiction are frozen.

US Department of the Treasury Press Release

February 05, 2013 - Treasury Targets Money Laundering Operation Linked to Los Zetas

The U.S. Department of the Treasury today announced the designation of Filemon Garcia Ayala, and two of his companies located in Mexico pursuant to the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act (Kingpin Act) for their links to Los Zetas, the violent Mexican drug cartel. In addition to the entities located in Mexico, Treasury is also identifying three U.S. companies affiliated with Filemon Garcia Ayala as blocked property pursuant to the Kingpin Act. Today’s action prohibits U.S. persons from conducting financial or commercial transactions with these designees, and also freezes any assets they may have under U.S. jurisdiction.

Filemon Garcia Ayala is a Mexican national who leads a money laundering network that makes large international transfers on behalf of Los Zetas. In June 2012, Mexican authorities sought to arrest Garcia Ayala on money laundering charges, but he fled and remains a fugitive.

“By exposing another key money operation tied to Los Zetas, Treasury is depriving the Zetas of an important avenue to launder their narco-dollars,” said Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control Director Adam J. Szubin. “We will continue to target individuals and businesses linked to Los Zetas and take any action necessary to protect the U.S. financial system from their illicit financial dealings.”

Treasury is designating two of Filemon Garcia Ayala’s companies located in Mexico, Prodira Casa de Cambio S.A. de C.V. and Trastreva S.A. de C.V., both located in Zacatecas, Mexico. OFAC is also identifying the following U.S. companies as blocked property due to Filemon Garcia Ayala’s interest in them: Prodira S.A. de C.V., incorporated in Texas; Prodira, Inc., which is currently incorporated in Arizona, Colorado, Iowa, and Texas; and Internacional & Nacional Exchange Services Inc., which is incorporated in Texas.

The President identified Los Zetas as a significant foreign narcotics trafficker pursuant to the Kingpin Act in April 2009. On July 24, 2011, the President identified Los Zetas as a significant Transnational Criminal Organization in the Annex to Executive Order 13581 (Blocking Property of Transnational Criminal Organizations).

Today’s action is part of ongoing efforts pursuant to the Kingpin Act to apply financial measures against significant foreign narcotics traffickers and their organizations worldwide. The Treasury Department has designated more than 1,200 individuals and entities pursuant to the Kingpin Act since June 2000. Penalties for violations of the Kingpin Act range from civil penalties of up to $1.075 million per violation to more severe criminal penalties. Criminal penalties for corporate officers may include up to 30 years in prison and fines up to $5 million. Criminal fines for corporations may reach $10 million. Other individuals face up to 10 years in prison and fines pursuant to Title 18 of the United States Code for criminal violations of the Kingpin Act.

January 23, 2013 - The U.S. Department of the Treasury today took action against three transnational criminal organizations (TCO), the Camorra, the Yakuza, and the Brothers’ Circle

Today’s designations include four members of the Camorra, one of Europe's largest criminal organizations; the Inagawa-kai, the third-largest clan within the Japanese Yakuza criminal network; and an individual providing support to a key member of the Brothers’ Circle, a large multi-ethnic Eurasian criminal network. These designations were imposed under Treasury’s authority targeting transnational organized crime.

President Obama identified the Camorra, the Yakuza, and the Brothers’ Circle along with the Zetas, as significant TCOs in the Annex to Executive Order 13581 (Blocking Property of Transnational Criminal Organizations) on July 24, 2011, and charged the Treasury Department with pursuing additional sanctions against its members and supporters to undermine and interdict their global criminal operations.

Today’s action freezes any assets these persons may have within the jurisdiction of the United States and generally prohibits any transactions with them by U.S. persons.

“The individuals designated today are key members of criminal organizations who engage in serious crimes around the world,” said David S. Cohen, Treasury Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence. “Treasury will continue to target additional members and supporters of these groups, as well as other significant TCOs, as we systematically expose their criminal operations and protect the U.S. financial system from their illicit activity.”

The Camorra

The Camorra operates internationally and is involved in serious criminal activity, such as money laundering, extortion, alien smuggling, robbery, blackmail, kidnapping, political corruption, and counterfeiting. In 2012 Italian law enforcement conducted multiple operations to seize Camorra assets, including 800 million euro seized from the Casalesi clan in July. To date, Treasury has identified five individuals affiliated with the Camorra under E.O. 13581, including their most prominent leaders Michele Zagaria and Antonio Iovine.

In August 2012 the Treasury Department designated Michele Zagaria, a leader of the Camorra Casalesi clan, who is serving a life sentence for conspiracy, murder, extortion, and robbery. The Camorra members designated today are all members of the immediate family of Michele Zagaria: his brothers Pasquale Zagaria, Carmine Zagaria, Antonio Zagaria, and his father Nicola Zagaria. Each of these four individuals is designated for acting for or on behalf of, or providing support to, Michele Zagaria and/or the Camorra. All the brothers have led the Caselasi clan at one point while other siblings were serving jail sentences. All are involved in the family’s criminal enterprises. This network has been involved in extortion, kidnapping, money laundering, and bribery.

The Yakuza

The Yakuza, reputedly the world’s largest criminal organization with over 70,000 members, is involved in serious criminal activities, including weapons trafficking, prostitution, human trafficking, drug trafficking, fraud, and money laundering. The Treasury Department designated the Yamaguchi-gumi and the Sumiyoshi-kai, in February and September 2012, respectively. The Inagawa-kai, designated today, is the third-largest of the Yakuza organizations, and the Department of the Treasury is targeting it today for acting for or on behalf of the Yakuza. The top three clans account for approximately 72.4 percent of the Yakuza membership. To date, Treasury has identified four individuals and two entities affiliated with the Yakuza under E.O. 13581, including their most prominent leaders Kenichi Shinoda and Shigeo Nishiguchi.

Today’s action also imposes sanctions on Jiro Kiyota, the top Inagawa-kai leader, as well as the Inagawa-kai’s second-in-command, Kazuo Uchibori, for acting for or on behalf of the Inagawa-kai. As leaders of Inagawa-kai, Kiyota and Uchibori play key roles in directing the syndicate’s policies and settling disputes with other Yakuza syndicates. Under the leadership of Kiyota and Uchibori, the Inagawa-kai has become increasingly aligned with the Yamaguchi-gumi.

The Brothers’ Circle

The Brothers’ Circle is a multi-ethnic criminal group composed of leaders and senior members of several Eurasian criminal groups largely based in countries of the former Soviet Union but extending to Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America. To date, Treasury has identified 15 individuals affiliated with the Brothers’ Circle and their associates under E.O. 13581, including their most prominent members Gafur Rakhimov and Zakhariy Kalashov. The Brothers’ Circle serves as a coordinating body for several national level criminal networks, mediating disputes between the individual criminal networks and directing global criminal activity.

On December 20, 2012, the Treasury Department designated Zakhariy Kalashov, a key member of the Brothers’ Circle and a prominent Eurasian organized crime figure with extensive connections to criminal groups in Russia and countries throughout Eurasia. His criminal activities include money laundering, extortion, criminal protection, and drug trafficking. He is currently incarcerated, serving a nine year sentence for money laundering in Spain. Marina Kalashova, who has been designated today, is a key part of Zakhariy Kalashov’s network. Kalashov communicates with Kalashova to pass messages on his behalf to his organization.

December 20, 2012 - Treasury Designates Key Members of the Brothers' Circle Criminal Organization

The U.S. Department of the Treasury today designated another key member of the Eurasian crime syndicate, the Brothers’ Circle, as well as two criminal associates of an individual who was previously designated for operating on behalf of the organization. These designations were made pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 13581, which targets entities or individuals determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Attorney General and the Secretary of State, to be significant transnational criminal organizations (TCOs) or to have links to such organizations. The Brothers’ Circle is one of five TCOs sanctioned under E.O. 13581, along with the Camorra, the Yakuza, Los Zetas, and MS-13. Over the past year, the Treasury Department has designated 12 individuals associated with the Brothers’ Circle.

Today’s action targets Zakhariy Kalashov for acting for or on behalf of, or providing material support to, the Brothers’ Circle, as well as Almanbet Anapiyaev and Adilet Kasenov, for acting for or on behalf of, or providing material support to, Kamychbek Kolbayev, who was designated under E.O. 13581 on February 23, 2012. Kolbayev had previously been designated under the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act on June 1, 2011. Kolbayev is currently in custody in Kyrgyzstan.

“This action further illuminates the Brothers’ Circle illicit network, and will help squeeze them out of the global financial system and protect the U.S. financial system from the group’s laundering of its criminal proceeds. We will continue to pursue members and supporters of the Brothers’ Circle, and today’s action against the group’s leadership will help us cast an even larger net to expose their financial facilitators and associates wherever they operate,” said Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence David S. Cohen.

President Obama identified the Brothers’ Circle as a significant TCO in the Annex to E.O. 13581 on July 24, 2011, and charged the Treasury Department with pursuing additional sanctions against its members and supporters. Today’s action freezes any assets the designees may have within the jurisdiction of the United States and prohibits any transactions with them by U.S. persons. These efforts protect the U.S. financial system from transnational criminal organizations and expose and disrupt the actions of individuals who are supporting or acting for or on behalf of the Brothers’ Circle.

The Brothers' Circle is a criminal group composed of leaders and senior members of several Eurasian criminal groups that are largely based in countries of the former Soviet Union, but also operate in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America. The Brothers' Circle serves as a coordinating body for several criminal networks, mediates disputes between the individual criminal networks, and directs member criminal activity globally.

Zakhariy Kalashov is a key member of the Brothers’ Circle. He is a prominent Eurasian organized crime figure and close associate of Lasha Shushanashvilli, who was also designated under E.O. 13581 on June 6, 2012. He has extensive connections to criminal groups in Russia and countries throughout Eurasia. According to law enforcement authorities, his criminal activities include money laundering, extortion, criminal protection, and trafficking in both arms and drugs. In June 2005, Kalashov escaped a Spanish police operation and fled to the United Arab Emirates (UAE), where he was arrested in 2006. After being extradited by the UAE to Spain, a Spanish court sentenced Kalashov to a 9-year prison term and imposed a 22.5 million Euro fine on him.

Almanbet Anapiyaev is a key associate of Kamchybek Kolbayev. Anapiyaev has been described as the deputy and “muscle” of Kolbayev’s criminal organization. A former police officer in Kyrgyzstan, Anapiyaev was fired for his ties to organized crime. Currently, Anapiyaev is subject to an Interpol Red Notice, a Kyrgyzstani arrest warrant, and he has been named to Kyrgyzstan’s Most Wanted List for kidnapping, illegal confinement, and robbery.

Adilet Kasenov is an active member of Kamchybek Kolbayev’s criminal organization, serving as treasurer and as Kolbayev’s bodyguard. Kasenov reportedly also serves as the “criminal governor” of the Issyk-Kul region of Kyrgyzstan. Kyrgyzstan has named Kasenov to its Most Wanted List for using violence against a government official, as well as for the illegal sale and possession of firearms and explosive devices. Kasenov is currently in custody in Kyrgyzstan.

October 11, 2012 - Specially Designated Nationals Update

Transnational Criminal Organizations Designation

September 27, 2012 - Actions Target the Second-Largest Clan within the Japanese Yakuza Criminal Network for Activities Including Human Trafficking The U.S. Department of the Treasury today announced the designation of the Sumiyoshi-kai, the second-largest clan within the Japanese Yakuza criminal network, and two of its leaders. This group and individuals are being designated by the Treasury Department pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 13581, which targets significant transnational criminal organizations (TCOs) and their supporters.

President Obama identified the Yakuza as a significant TCO in the Annex to E.O. 13581 of July 24, 2011. Since then, the Treasury Department has targeted the Yakuza by designating the Yamaguchi-gumi (the largest and most prominent of the Yakuza’s crime families) and two of its leaders.

“Through this action, we will continue to work toward disrupting the criminal activities of the Yakuza and dismantling its financial network,” said Treasury Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence David S. Cohen. “Today’s designation of the Sumiyoshi-kai also supports the Administration’s intensified efforts to combat trafficking in persons given the Yakuza’s long-standing involvement in sex trafficking throughout Asia.”

Today, the Treasury Department is continuing to target this criminal group and disrupt its activities by identifying another key Yakuza organization and its leaders, freezing any assets they may have within the jurisdiction of the United States and prohibiting any transactions with them by U.S. persons. These efforts are designed to protect the U.S. financial system from the malign influence of transnational criminal organizations and expose the individuals who are supporting or acting on behalf of the Yakuza.

The Yakuza and its crime clans, including the Sumiyoshi-kai, are involved in serious criminal activities, including weapons trafficking, prostitution, human trafficking, drug trafficking, fraud, and money laundering. The Sumiyoshi-kai is the second-largest and most prominent of the Yakuza organizations, and the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) is targeting it today for acting for or on behalf of the Yakuza.

Today’s action also imposes sanctions on Shigeo Nishiguchi, the top Sumiyoshi-kai leader as well as the Sumiyoshi-kai’s deputy, Hareaki Fukuda, both for acting for or on behalf of the Sumiyoshi-kai. As leaders of the Sumiyoshi-kai, both Nishiguchi and Fukuda play key roles in directing the syndicate’s policies and settling disputes with other Yakuza syndicates.

August 01, 2012 - Transnational Criminal Organizations Designations - Treasury Sanctions Members of the Camorra

The U.S. Department of the Treasury today designated five key leaders of the Camorra, one of Europe's largest criminal organizations, under its authority to impose sanctions targeting transnational organized crime. The Camorra is involved in money laundering, extortion, alien smuggling, robbery, blackmail, kidnapping, political corruption, and counterfeiting around the world. It is one of four transnational criminal organizations (TCOs) specifically identified by the President for sanctions under E.O. 13581 (Blocking Property of Transnational Criminal Organizations), along with the Brothers’ Circle, the Yakuza, and the Zetas. The Camorra leaders designated today are Antonio Iovine, Michele Zagaria, Mario Caterino, Paolo Di Mauro, and Giuseppe Dell’Aquila, all leaders or senior members of Camorra clans. Each of these five individuals is designated for acting for or on behalf of, or providing support to, the Camorra.

President Obama identified the Camorra as a significant TCO in the Annex to E.O. 13581 on July 24, 2011, and charged the Treasury Department with pursuing additional sanctions against its members and supporters. Drawing on this authority, the Treasury Department is taking action against the Camorra by identifying and designating these five key leaders. Today’s action freezes any assets they may have within the jurisdiction of the United States and prohibits any transactions with them by U.S. persons. These efforts protect the U.S. financial system from transnational criminal organizations and expose and disrupt the actions of individuals who are supporting or acting for or on behalf of the Camorra.

“This action is designed to squeeze the Camorra out of the global financial system and protect the U.S. financial system from laundering of its criminal proceeds. We will continue to pursue members and supporters of the Camorra, and today’s action against the group’s leadership will help us cast an even larger net to expose their financial facilitators and associates wherever they may operate,” said Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence David S. Cohen.

The Camorra operates internationally and is involved in serious criminal activity, such as counterfeiting and narcotics trafficking. In March 2012 more than a billion dollars worth of Camorra assets reportedly were seized by Italian law enforcement.

Mario Caterino is a Camorra clan leader, identified at the time of his arrest in May 2011 as the second in command of the Casalesi clan. He is serving a life sentence in Italy for conspiracy and murder.

Giuseppe Dell’Aquila is described as the head of the Mallardo clan. He is believed to have played a key role in investing in and managing Camorra holding companies. Arrested in Italy in May 2011, he is serving a sentence for conspiracy, money laundering, robbery, and the receipt of stolen goods.

Paolo di Mauro was the third most wanted fugitive in Italy at the time of his arrest in Spain in January 2010. He is a leader of the Contini clan and is currently serving a 17-year sentence for conspiracy and murder.

Antonio Iovine is a leader of the Camorra’s Casalesi clan. He was arrested in November 2010 and is serving a life sentence for conspiracy and murder.

Michele Zagaria is a leader of the Casalesi clan and was captured by Italian authorities in December 2011 after 15 years as a fugitive. He is serving a life sentence for conspiracy, murder, extortion, and robbery.

July 24, 2012 - Treasury Targets Corporate Network of Sinaloa Cartel Drug Lord ""El Azul""

The U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) today announced the designation of nine entities and 10 individuals linked to Juan Jose Esparragoza Moreno (a.k.a. El Azul), a leader of Mexico’s Sinaloa Cartel. El Azul has used proceeds from his involvement in the narcotics trade to build a large network of businesses including a housing development, a shopping mall, and an industrial park. These businesses are operated by members of his network including his family. Today’s action, taken pursuant to the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act (Kingpin Act), prohibits U.S. persons from conducting financial or commercial transactions with these entities and individuals, and also freezes any assets they may have under U.S. jurisdiction.

“While other Mexican narcotics traffickers have garnered and in some cases sought more attention, Esparragoza Moreno has purposely kept a low profile hoping to avoid scrutiny while increasing his influence and ill-gotten gains,” said Treasury’s OFAC Director Adam J. Szubin. “Today’s action shines the spotlight on this godfather of Mexican narcotics. His entire corporate network that was created with illicit drug proceeds is in our sights.”

The President identified Esparragoza Moreno and the Sinaloa Cartel as significant foreign narcotics traffickers pursuant to the Kingpin Act in 2003 and 2009, respectively. Esparragoza Moreno was indicted on drug trafficking charges in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas in 2003. He is wanted in both the U.S. and Mexico – the U.S. State Department Narcotics Rewards Program is offering a reward of up to $5 million for information leading to Esparragoza Moreno’s arrest and/or conviction while Mexican authorities are offering 30 million pesos for information leading to his capture. Esparragoza Moreno has been active in drug trafficking since the 1970s.

Today’s action targets 10 individuals, including six family members of Esparragoza Moreno. Maria Guadalupe Gastelum Payan, one of Esparragoza Moreno’s wives, owns property in Tlajomulco de Zuniga, a town near Guadalajara, on behalf of Esparragoza Moreno. Gastelum Payan and her four children with Esparragoza Moreno own and operate the companies Grupo Cinjab, S.A. de C.V. and Grupo Impergoza, S.A. de C.V. in order to manage the aforementioned property, where they developed a residential community named Provenza Residencial and a shopping mall named Provenza Center. In addition, Grupo Impergoza, S.A. de C.V. also manages La Tijera Parque Industrial, an industrial park.

The four children of Esparragoza Moreno and Gastelum Payan who were designated today are: Brenda Guadalupe, Cristian Ivan, Juan Ignacio, and Nadia Patricia Esparragoza Gastelum. Juvencio Ignacio Gonzalez Parada, who plays a key role in Grupo Cinjab, S.A. de C.V. and Grupo Impergoza, S.A. de C.V., was also designated today. The final Esparragoza Moreno family member designated today is Ofelia Monzon Araujo, also a wife of Esparragoza Moreno. She and three other individuals designated today – Elvira Araujo Monzon, Ulises Guzman Ochoa, and Martin Humberto Ponce Felix – own and/or control the following seven gas station companies located in Culiacan, Sinaloa on behalf of Esparragoza Moreno: Buenos Aires Servicios, S.A. de C.V., Estaciones de Servicios Canarias, S.A. de C.V., Gasodiesel y Servicios Ancona, S.A. de C.V., Gasolinera Alamos Country, S.A. de C.V., Gasolinera y Servicios Villabonita, S.A. de C.V., Petrobarrancos, S.A. de C.V., and Servicios Chulavista, S.A. de C.V.

Today’s action would not have been possible without the support of the Drug Enforcement Administration.

Internationally, OFAC has designated more than 1,100 businesses and individuals linked to 97 drug kingpins since June 2000. Penalties for violations of the Kingpin Act range from civil penalties of up to $1.075 million per violation to more severe criminal penalties. Criminal penalties for corporate officers may include up to 30 years in prison and fines up to $5 million. Criminal fines for corporations may reach $10 million. Other individuals could face up to 10 years in prison and fines pursuant to Title 18 of the United States Code for criminal violations of the Kingpin Act.

February 23, 2012 - Transnational Criminal Organizations - Treasury Imposes Sanctions On Key Members Of The Yakuza And Brothers’ Circle Criminal Organizations

The U.S. Department of the Treasury today designated seven key members and associates of the Brothers' Circle crime syndicate as well as the largest group within the Japanese Yakuza, the Yamaguchi-gumi, and two Yamaguchi-gumi leaders. These are the first designations by Treasury pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 13581, which President Obama issued in 2011 to target and disrupt significant transnational criminal organizations (TCOs).

President Obama identified the Brothers' Circle and the Yakuza as significant TCOs in the Annex to E.O. 13581 (Blocking Property of Transnational Criminal Organizations) of July 24, 2011, and charged the Treasury Department with pursuing additional sanctions against their members and supporters. Drawing on this authority, the Treasury Department today is identifying key members and associates of these transnational organized criminal networks, freezing any assets the designated persons may have within the jurisdiction of the United States and prohibiting any transactions with them by U.S. persons.

""Today's action casts a spotlight on key members of criminal organizations that have engaged in a wide range of serious crimes across the globe,"" said David S. Cohen, Treasury Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence. ""We will continue to work with our international partners to target those who deal in violence, narcotics, money laundering, and the exploitation of women and children. Today's designations are just the first under our new our sanctions authority to target transnational criminal organizations and isolate them from the global financial system.""

THE BROTHERS' CIRCLE The Brothers' Circle (f.k.a. Family of Eleven; f.k.a. The Twenty) is a multi-ethnic criminal group composed of leaders and senior members of several Eurasian criminal groups largely based in countries of the former Soviet Union but operating in Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Latin America. The Brothers' Circle serves as a coordinating body for several criminal networks, mediating disputes between the individual criminal networks and directing member criminal activity globally.

The individuals designated today represent criminal syndicates that operate throughout Eurasia and the Gulf, specifically within Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Russia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). They include key Brothers' Circle members Vladislav Leontyev, Vasiliy Khristoforov, Kamchybek Kolbayev and Gafur Rakhimov. Lazar Shaybazyan, Aleksandr Manuylov and Aleksey Zaytsev are designated today based on their support to Vladislav Leontyev. Several of these individuals reside in Dubai, UAE.

Two key Brothers' Circle members, Vladislav Leontyev and Vasiliy Khristoforov, are targeted today for acting for or on behalf of the Brothers' Circle. Both have been involved in criminal activities, including narcotics trafficking, and were involved in a shooting between regional factions within Russian organized criminal networks over an attempt to seize control of a local precious metals enterprise. Leontyev is currently wanted by Russian authorities for illegal transactions involving precious metals and narcotics.

Kamchybek Kolbayev acts for or on behalf of the Brothers' Circle by serving as the Brothers' Circle ""overseer"" for its Central Asian activities, including narcotics trafficking. In June 2011, President Obama identified Kolbayev as a significant foreign narcotics trafficker under the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act. Kolbayev is wanted in Kyrgyzstan for organized crimes and crimes involving the use of weapons/explosives, and organized/transnational crime.

As a key member of the Brothers' Circle, Gafur Rakhimov acts for or on behalf of the Brothers' Circle. Rakhimov is one of the leaders of Uzbek organized crime with a specialty in the organized production of drugs in the countries of Central Asia. He has operated major international drug syndicates involving the trafficking of heroin.

Aleksey Zaytsev, who acts for or on behalf of the Brothers' Circle key member Vladislav Leontyev, is involved in fraud and a variety of other such activities as fraud, including his 2008 participation in a financial pyramid scheme involving the St. Petersburg-based Business Club Rubin.

Lazar Shaybazyan and Aleksandr Manuylov also act for or on behalf of, Brothers' Circle key member Vladislav Leontyev.

The YAKUZA

The Yakuza (a.k.a. Boryokudan; a.k.a. Gokudo) was listed in the Annex to E.O. 13581 for its involvement in serious criminal activities, including weapons trafficking, prostitution, human trafficking, drug trafficking, fraud and money laundering. The Yamaguchi-gumi is the largest and most prominent of the Yakuza's crime families, and is being designated today for acting for or on behalf of the Yakuza. The Yamaguchi-gumi has a pyramid structure with a kumicho (""godfather"") at the top. Today's action also imposes sanctions on Kenichi Shinoda, the Yamaguchi-gumi kumicho since August 2005, as well as the Yamaguchi-gumi's wakagashira (""deputy godfather""), Kiyoshi Takayama, both for acting for or on behalf of Yamaguchi-gumi.

As leaders of the Yamaguchi-gumi crime syndicate, both Shinoda and Takayama play key roles in directing the syndicate's policies and settling disputes with other Yakuza syndicates. The Yamaguchi-gumi is involved in criminal endeavors in Japan and abroad, including drug trafficking, human trafficking, extortion, prostitution, fraud and money laundering. The Yamaguchi-gumi is estimated to generate billions of dollars annually in illicit proceeds.

Today's action is designed to protect the integrity of the U.S. financial system, to prevent U.S. financial institutions from being used unwittingly to facilitate the unlawful activities of these groups, and to deny the named individuals and entity access to the U.S. economy.

The Order also authorizes the U.S. Department of the Treasury, in consultation with the Departments of Justice and State, to identify for sanctions any individual or entity determined to have materially assisted, sponsored or provided financial, material or technological support for any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this Order.

The US encourage partners and allies to echo the commitment and join in building a new framework for international cooperation to protect all our citizens from the violence, harm and exploitation wrought by transnational organized crime.

In signing today’s Order, the President imposed sanctions on the following organizations listed - Executive Order

Name AKA / FKA Main Location Description Remarks
The Brothers’ Circle f.k.a. FAMILY OF ELEVEN; f.k.a. THE TWENTY Eurasia / former Soviet Union States The Brothers’ Circle is a multi-ethnic criminal group composed of leaders and senior members of several Eurasian criminal groups largely based in countries of the former Soviet Union but extending to the Middle East, Africa and Latin America. Many Brothers’ Circle members share a common ideology based on the “thief-in-law” tradition, which seeks to spread their brand of criminal influence globally. The Brothers’ Circle serves as a coordinating body for several national level criminal networks, which includes mediating disputes between the individual criminal networks and directing global criminal activity.
Camorra Italian Mafia Italy Considered the largest Italian organized crime group, the Camorra is a loose collection of allied and competing local clans in the province of Naples and the Campania region of Italy. The Camorra operates internationally and is involved in serious criminal activity such as counterfeiting and narcotics trafficking. The Camorra may earn more than 10 percent of its roughly $25 billion annual profit through the sale of counterfeit and pirated goods – such as luxury clothing, power tools, CDs, DVDs, and software – in European and U.S. markets. The Camorra's counterfeiting and piracy activities undermine U.S. sales of genuine products and deny U.S. copyright holders of profits. The International Intellectual Property Alliance (IIPA), a private sector coalition of trade associations, estimates that copyright piracy causes trade losses with Italy of more than $1 billion every year. - August 01, 2012 Treasury Sanctions Members of the Camorra
Mara Salvatrucha MS-13 aka Mara aka MS El Salvador The Mara Salvatrucha gang originated in Los Angeles and has spread to Central America, other parts of the United States, and Canada. It is commonly abbreviated as MS, Mara, and MS-13. There is some dispute about the etymology of the name. The most common belief is that the word ""Mara"" refers to the Spanish word for ""gang"", and ""Salvatrucha"" (which is Spanish slang) for ""Salvadoran army ant"". Alternatively, it is suggested that ""Salvatrucha"" refers to the Salvadoran peasant guerrillas, the source of much of the gang's early manpower. The number 13 is homage to the Los Angeles gang ""Los Emes"" or ""The Ms""(M being the thirteenth letter of the alphabet). The gang was set up in Los Angeles in 1980's by Salvadoran immigrants in the city's Pico-Union neighborhood.

Yakuza Japanese Mafia a.k.a. BORYOKUDAN; a.k.a. GOKUDO Japan The Yakuza comprises the major Japanese organized crime syndicates, sometimes referred to as “families,” and had more than 80,000 members as of 2008. The Yakuza derives most of its profits from the drug trade, particularly methamphetamine, the most widely abused drug in Japan. The Yakuza also profits from other serious criminal activities, including weapons trafficking and nearly all aspects of sexual exploitation: sex tourism, prostitution, human trafficking, “mail order” marriages, pornography, and the exploitation of women and children, with the help of local crime syndicates in East Asia. The Yakuza is also heavily involved in white-collar crime, often using front companies to hide illicit proceeds within legitimate industries, including construction, real estate and finance. In addition to its networks in Japan, the Yakuza acts globally. It has relationships with criminal affiliates in Asia, Europe and the Americas. In the United States, the Yakuza has been involved primarily in drug trafficking and money laundering.

YAMAGUCHI-GUMI Japanese Mafia a.k.a. ROKUDAIME YAMAGUCHI-GUMI; a.k.a. SIXTH YAMAGUCHI-GUMI Japan It is one of the largest criminal organizations in the world. Estimates put the number of active members at just over 55,000, with thousands more having strong associations. It is, by far, the largest of the boryokudan groups, and its membership encompasses roughly 45% of the 86,300 yakuza in the Japanese underworld. Formal members of the Yamaguchi-gumi number 102 people in total; 1 kumicho, 15 shatei (younger brother) and 86 wakachu (child) as of November 2005 (source Wikipedia)
Los Zetas Mexico Formerly the armed wing of the Gulf Cartel, Los Zetas is an extremely violent transnational criminal organization based primarily in Mexico. The organization is estimated to have thousands of members in Mexico, Central America and the United States. Los Zetas facilitates drug trafficking into the United States and has relationships with U.S.-based gangs. Los Zetas is specifically responsible for the safe passage of large quantities of illegal narcotics, including cocaine, methamphetamine, heroin and marijuana moving through Mexico and eventually into the United States. In addition to drug trafficking, Los Zetas is involved in extortion, money laundering, intellectual property theft and human smuggling. Los Zetas and Gulf Cartel members together are named in multiple indictments in Federal District courts for violating U.S. narcotics laws. These indictments allege that Los Zetas has carried out numerous acts of violence, including murders, kidnappings and tortures. - Los Zetas members are responsible for mass murders in Mexico and Guatemala, and have demonstrated their capacity and willingness to intimidate and brazenly kill law enforcement and other government personnel. In February 2011, Los Zetas members ambushed and killed Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Special Agent Jaime Zapata and seriously wounded ICE Agent Victor Avila. In April 2011, Mexico's Office of the Attorney General announced the arrest of Los Zetas cell leaders connected to the discovery of nearly 200 bodies dumped in mass graves in San Fernando, Tamaulipas, Mexico. The victims were kidnapped from passenger buses traveling toward the U.S.-Mexico border. In May 2011, Los Zetas members stormed a ranch in northern Guatemala and killed 27 people and later killed the Guatemalan prosecutor involved in the investigation of the murders.

August 29, 2012 - The Treasury Department targeted a Mexican oil services firm owned by Francisco Antonio Colorado Cessa, who it has already identified as a drug trafficker and is U.S. custody awaiting trial on money laundering charges. The action prohibits U.S. companies and individuals from doing business with ADT Petroservicios SA De C.V. and freezes any assets the company has under U.S. jurisdiction. OFAC Enforcement Action

The President identified Los Zetas as a significant foreign narcotics trafficker under the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act in 2009. The U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) has since designated four principal Los Zetas and Gulf Cartel leaders and 54 Mexican principal lieutenants and enforcers for Los Zetas and the Gulf Cartel pursuant to the Kingpin Act.​

The US Treasury has imposed economic sanctions on a Pakistani Islamic school it describes as a ""terrorist training centre"" which provides support to al-Qaeda and the Taliban.

In a statement it said that the Ganj madrassa in Peshawar was being used as a training and recruiting base.

The Treasury said that it was the first time that a madrassa had been the target of sanctions.

There has so far been no reaction to the move from madrassa staff.

Madrassas are schools managed under Islamic principles.

The sanctions forbid Americans from having any business interaction with the Ganj madrassa, in addition to freezing any of its assets that come under US jurisdiction.

""The Ganj Madrassa serves as a terrorist training centre where students, under the guise of religious studies, have been radicalised to conduct terrorist and insurgent activities,"" the statement said.

""In some cases, students were trained to become bomb manufacturers and suicide bombers.""

According to the US Treasury, the madrassa was also used as a base by the radical Lashkar-e-Taiba group - blamed for the November 2008 Mumbai attacks that killed 166 people.

Correspondents say that Ganj madrassa head Fazeel-A-Tul Shaykh Abu Mohammed Ameen Al-Peshawari, also known as Shaykh Aminullah, has been classified as a terrorist by the US and UN since 2009 because of his support for al-Qaeda and the Taliban.

""This action does not generally target madrassas, which often play an essential role in improving literacy and providing humanitarian and developmental aid in many areas of the world, including Pakistan,"" the statement said.

The Treasury also announced sanctions on Umar Siddique Kathio Azmarai, who it said had served as a facilitator and courier for al-Qaeda since the late 1990s, including providing support for the family of Osama bin Laden.

AUSTIN, Texas – A Nigerian national residing in Austin has been sentenced to just over four years in federal prison for his participation in a conspiracy that laundered more than $1.7 million.

33-year-old Nosa Onaghise was sentenced to 51 months in federal prison for his role in a conspiracy that laundered more than $1.7 million in Business Email Compromise (BEC) scam proceeds stolen from multiple companies. He must also pay $1,639,419.57 in restitution, pay a $230,000 money judgment, forfeit $14,282.50 seized from a bank account, and be placed on supervised release for three years.

In a BEC scheme, scammers target businesses and individuals making wire transfer payments, often targeting employees with access to company finances, says the US Attorney’s office. The scammers trick the employees into making wire transfer payments to bank accounts thought to belong to trusted partners-except the money ends up in accounts controlled by the fraudsters.

Sometimes the scammers use computer intrusion techniques to alter legitimate payment request emails, changing the recipient bank accounts, according to the US Attorney’s office. Sometimes they send spoofed emails from email addresses similar to the real email accounts used by trusted partners.

In 2018, Onaghise pleaded guilty to one count of passport fraud admitting to attempting to use a false, forged, or counterfeit passport to open several bank accounts in the U.S. in furtherance of the fraud scheme.

Last December, Onaghise’s co-defendant Joseph Odibobhahemen, a 28-year-old Nigerian citizen formerly residing in Austin, was sentenced to 78 months in federal prison for his role in the fraud scheme.

Court records show that between November 2016 and April 2019, over $10 million was allegedly sent by victims to accounts controlled by the conspirators, who were able to take in excess of $6 million before law enforcement or financial institutions stopped the fraudulent transfers.

Onaghise, Odibobhahemen, and four other co-conspirators acquired or controlled dozens of bank accounts in the U.S., including in Austin, using fraudulent IDs, including fraudulent foreign passports in fake names, says the US Attorney’s office. Once the funds were fraudulently procured and deposited into these bogus accounts, the defendants worked quickly to withdraw or transfer the funds.

The four additional co-conspirators have all pleaded guilty and are currently serving lengthy federal prison terms. Bameyi Omale is serving 135 months, Chinonso Agbaji is serving 78 months, Igho Calaba is serving 30 months and Chibuzor Uba-Omale is serving 36 months.",money laundering

WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of the Treasury today designated six individuals and four entities linked to the Brothers’ Circle, a Eurasian crime syndicate, pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 13581, which targets significant transnational criminal organizations (TCOs). Today’s actions are focused on the criminal networks of two key members of the Brothers Circle, Vladislav Leontyev and Gafur Rakhimov, both of whom were designated by the Treasury Department for acting on behalf of the Brothers’ Circle in February 2012. Today’s designations include individuals and businesses in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East working on behalf of Leontyev and Rakhimov and support Treasury’s efforts to disrupt the illicit financial networks that provide revenue and support for their global criminal activities.

“The key to targeting transnational criminal organizations, such as the Brothers’ Circle, is exposing the network behind the group’s leaders, which we have done today. We remain determined to continue our systematic effort to disrupt these networks in order to protect the U.S. financial system from abuse by these criminals,” said Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence David S. Cohen.

The Brothers’ Circle is one of five TCOs sanctioned under E.O. 13581, along with the Camorra, the Yakuza, Los Zetas, and MS-13. Today’s action brings to 28 the total number of individuals and entities designated by the Treasury Department for acting for or on behalf of the Brothers’ Circle.

The Brothers’ Circle is a criminal group composed of leaders and senior members of several Eurasian criminal groups that are largely based in the countries of the former Soviet Union, but which also operate in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America. The Brothers’ Circle serves as a coordinating body for several criminal networks, mediates disputes between individual criminal networks, and directs member criminal activity globally.

Today’s action generally prohibits U.S. persons from conducting financial or commercial transactions with these entities and individuals, and freezes any assets they may have under U.S. jurisdiction.

Targets Linked to Vladislav Leontyev

Vladislav Leontyev was designated by the Treasury Department under E.O. 13581 on February 23, 2012, for acting for or on behalf of the Brothers’ Circle. Vladislav Leontyev is a key member of the Brothers’ Circle and has been involved in various criminal activities, including narcotics trafficking. He was also involved in a shooting between regional factions within Russian organized criminal networks over an attempt to seize control of a local precious metals enterprise. The following individuals were designated today, along with entities they own or control, because they act for or on behalf of Vladislav Leontyev:

Vadim Lyalin serves as a conduit for passing messages on behalf of Vladislav Leontyev;

Grigory Lepsveridze couriers money on behalf of Vladislav Leontyev;

Igor Shlykov has worked to get identification documents and to develop business opportunities in Africa on Vladislav Leontyev’s behalf. Igor Shlykov also owns or controls M S Group Invest OOO and Meridian Jet Management GmbH based in Russia and Austria respectively. He is the director-general of M S Group Invest OOO and owns 60 percent of Meridian Jet Management GmbH;

Gurgen House FZCO is owned or controlled by Lazar Shaybazian who was designated in February 2012, for acting for or on behalf of Vladislav Leontyev. Gurgen House FZCO has offices in the U.A.E., Uzbekistan, and Russia. Lazar Shaybazian uses Gurgen House FZCO to move money.

Targets Linked to Gafur Rakhimov

In February 2012, Gafur Rakhimov was designated by the Treasury Department pursuant to E.O. 13581 for acting on behalf of the Brothers’ Circle. Gafur Rakhimov is a key member of the Brothers’ Circle and one of the leaders of Uzbek organized crime with a specialty in the organized production of drugs in Central Asia. He has operated major international drug syndicates involving the trafficking of heroin. Sergey Moskalenko and Yakov Rybalskiy were designated today by the Treasury Department because they act for or on behalf of Gafur Rakhimov.

Artur Badalyan

Artur Badalyan and his company Fasten Tourism LLC were designed today pursuant to E.O. 13581 because they are used by key members of the Brothers’ Circle to courier money and make travel arrangements. Artur Badalyan is the owner and CEO of Fasten Tourism LLC.

TMML2024037015391,Andrew Fastow,"Alert ID: TMML2024037015391
Deputy Attorney General James B. Comey, Assistant Attorney General Christopher A. Wray of the Criminal Division, Enron Task Force Director Leslie R. Caldwell, and FBI Director Robert Mueller announced today that Andrew S. Fastow, the former chief financial officer (CFO) of Enron Corporation, has pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiracy to commit securities and wire fraud and is cooperating with an ongoing criminal investigation into Enron's collapse.
Fastow, the highest-level defendant to be charged to date in the Enron investigation, entered his plea today before Judge Kenneth Hoyt at U.S. District Court in Houston, Texas. Under the terms of a plea agreement, Fastow will cooperate fully with the government's investigation, serve a 10-year prison sentence on the two counts to which he's pleading guilty, and forfeit more than $29 million. The remaining 96 criminal charges against Fastow from a May 2003 indictment are pending, and will be dismissed if the government determines that Fastow has cooperated fully and truthfully.
In addition, former Enron Assistant Treasurer Lea W. Fastow, Andrew Fastow's wife, has agreed to plead guilty to filing a false joint tax return for 2000, in which she failed to report income from a partnership related to Enron. She is expected to enter the guilty plea before Judge David Hittner at federal court in Houston later today.
""As one of the masterminds behind a massive fraud scheme, Andrew Fastow constructed an elaborate wall of deceit—shielding the reality of Enron's failing business from the watchful eye of shareholders and the investing public,"" said Deputy Attorney General James B. Comey, the head of President Bush's Corporate Fraud Task Force. ""Today's plea tears that wall down. Using Mr. Fastow's cooperation, we will continue to tear the wall down by prosecuting each person to which the evidence and the law leads us.""
""The Andrew Fastow plea and cooperation agreement opens wide a window into the fraudulent practices of Enron's senior management,"" stated Assistant Attorney General Christopher A. Wray. ""Fastow's prison sentence demonstrates once again that we will uncover fraudulent conduct by corporate officials, and the consequences will be serious.""
FBI Director Robert Mueller said, ""Today's plea agreements are a significant milestone in an intensive two-year investigation. The FBI and our partners on the Enron Task Force will continue our efforts to uncover the full extent of criminal conduct that contributed to Enron's collapse. Corporate criminals should be on notice that no matter how complex or intricate their schemes, they are going to be held accountable for their actions.""

""The forfeiture of more than $29 million in personal assets by the Fastows, a sum only a few Americans will earn in their lifetime, speaks to the magnitude of their criminal activities,"" stated Internal Revenue Service Commissioner Mark W. Everson. ""Our investigation substantiated that the Fastows filed multiple false tax returns, and, through her plea agreement announced today, Mrs. Fastow, an MBA and former assistant treasurer at Enron, acknowledges the Fastows' willful criminal conduct.""
Andrew Fastow Pleads Guilty; Agrees to Serve 10 Years in Prison
Fastow pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiracy, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371. The charges carry a maximum statutory sentence of 10 years in prison, followed by three years of supervised release. As part of his plea agreement, Fastow agreed to serve 10 years in prison and to cooperate fully with the government's ongoing criminal investigation of the collapse of the Enron Corporation.
As part of the plea agreement, Fastow admitted that he and other members of Enron's senior management conspired in wide-ranging schemes to fraudulently manipulate Enron's publicly reported financial results. Fastow also admitted participating in schemes to enrich himself at the expense of the company and its shareholders. Specifically, Fastow admitted that he conspired with senior management to cause Enron to enter into improper transactions with the LJM entities, which were under Fastow's control. And he admitted to engaging in self-dealing transactions to enrich himself and others in connection with the so-called Southampton transaction which involved the $30 million buyout by Enron of an entity called LJM Swap Sub, LP, which Fastow controlled. In engaging in these transactions, Mr. Fastow admitted that he violated his duty of loyalty and honest services to Enron's shareholders.
Fastow's sentencing is scheduled for April 19, 2004.
Lea Fastow to Plead Guilty; Agrees to Serve Five Months in Prison
Lea W. Fastow is scheduled to enter her guilty plea today before Judge David Hittner of the U.S. District Court in the Southern District of Texas. Under the applicable U.S. Sentencing Guidelines, Fastow faces an estimated range of imprisonment of 10 to 16 months. The parties have agreed to recommend to the court a sentence at the low end of this range, which would allow the court to impose a ""split"" sentence of five months incarceration and five months of home confinement as a condition of supervised release.
As part of her plea agreement, Fastow admitted that from December 1997 through 2000, she failed to report as income a total of $204,444.34 in proceeds that her family received from an Enron ""special purpose entity"" known as RADR. Fastow admitted that she knew that this money was derived from RADR and that her husband had been prohibited from investing in RADR. To hide the fact that it was taxable income, the money was disguised as ""gifts"" to the Fastow family, through checks made payable to Fastow, her husband Andrew and their children. To avoid triggering the law's requirement that gifts in excess of $10,000 to another person be reported to the Internal Revenue Service, most of these checks were made payable in amounts of $10,000 or less and in the names of different members of the Fastow family. Although she knew that the payments represented income that should have been reported on their joint federal income tax returns, Fastow concealed the income from the Fastows' accountant and intentionally failed to report the income on their joint federal income tax returns for the years 1997 through 2000. Fastow admitted that she signed these income tax returns under penalty of perjury and caused them to be filed with the Internal Revenue Service.
Fastow faces sentencing at a date to be determined.
Enron, at one time the seventh-ranked company in the United States with stock trading as high as $80 per share in August 1999, filed for bankruptcy protection on Dec. 2, 2001 and its stock became virtually worthless.
The investigation into Enron's collapse is being conducted by the Enron Task Force, a team of federal prosecutors supervised by the Justice Department's Criminal Division and agents from the FBI and the IRS Criminal Investigation Division. The Task Force also has coordinated with an received considerable assistance from the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Enron Task Force is part of President Bush's Corporate Fraud Task Force, created in July 2002 to investigate allegations of fraud and corruption at U.S. corporations.
Twenty-six individuals have been charged to date, including 19 former Enron executives. With today's pleas, seven people and Arthur Andersen LLP have been convicted as a result of the ongoing investigation. In addition, the Enron Task Force has restrained more than $93 million in proceeds derived from criminal activity. The Task Force investigation is continuing.","cahrged for fraud, with settlement"

Zimbabwe's vice-president says she is taking legal action against state-owned media for linking her to an alleged plot to kill President Robert Mugabe.

Joyce Mujuru said she had ordered her lawyers to restore her ""political standing"" after being falsely accused of treason and corruption.

The Sunday Mail newspaper reported that a hit-man had planned to kill Mr Mugabe so that Mrs Mujuru could take power.

Last month, Mr Mugabe, 90, said he did not plan to step down.

He has governed Zimbabwe since independence in 1980.

'Demonic'

Mr Mugabe and Mrs Mujuru were once close comrades, but have now fallen out as a succession war rages in the ruling Zanu-PF party ahead of its elective congress next month, says the BBC's Brian Hungwe in the capital, Harare.

Mr Mugabe's wife Grace Mugabe has recently led a sustained public campaign against Mrs Mujuru, calling on her to resign.

image copyrightAP

She has accused the vice-president of being ""demonic"" and divisive"", and extorting money from companies, the AFP news agency reports.

Mrs Mujuru's statement, denying she is plotting against Mr Mugabe, is unprecedented, our reporter says.

Although she does not give any indication that she plans to quit, she is under intense pressure and has few options, he adds.

The Sunday Mail made the sensational claim that top government officials linked to Mrs Mujuru sought to hire a hit-man to assassinate Mr Mugabe in order to open the way for her to become president, he adds.

""I deny any and all allegations of treason, corruption, incompetence and misuse of public office being routinely made against me in The Herald and The Sunday Mail newspapers,"" Mrs Mujuru said in a statement.

She had asked her lawyers to take the ""necessary steps at law to restore my good reputation, political standing and dignity"", she said.

'Spill Blood'

Mrs Mujuru and Justice Minister Emmerson Mnangagwa, who in the past controlled the secret police and military, are seen as the leading contenders to succeed Mr Mugabe.

Mrs Mugabe's surprise entry into politics this year, and her nomination to lead Zanu-PF's women's wing, has also fuelled speculation that she could be planning to take over from her husband.

Last month, Mr Mugabe said he did not plan to step aside for young politicians who did not appreciate his role in the struggle against colonialism and imperialism.

Mrs Mujuru took part in the 1970s guerrilla war against white-minority rule, led by Mr Mugabe.

Her nom de guerre was Teurai Ropa (Spill Blood).

New Netflix series Trial By Media is taking a hard look at “some of the most dramatic and memorable trials in recent history” through the lens of the idea that “courtroom dramas have increasingly been transformed into a form of entertainment.”

One such trial is that of Richard Scrushy, aka “King Richard,” the former CEO of HealthSouth Corporation, an Alabama-based global healthcare company. Here’s what you need to know about his corruption trial and what he’s doing now.

Richard Scrushy Today

On Scrushy’s personal website, he bills himself as a “speaker, businessman, entrepreneur” and he is available to hire for speaking engagements. It also says he and wife Leslie have nine children and six grandchildren, and that he is “a commercial instrument multiengine pilot, an author, a musician, and a songwriter.”

In a 2014 interview with CBS 42 WIAT, Scrushy said of his time in prison, “It was kind of like growing up in a very austere situation … we had a lot of time on our hands.” He said he spent that time teaching in the prison’s education program and grew in his faith.

Scrushy Underwent Two Criminal Trials

Trial by Media | Official Trailer | NetflixFrom Executive Producers George Clooney and Grant Heslov, six televised cases defined by headlines reaching across different areas of the law including the unforgettable Jenny Jones made-for-Court TV murder trials, the sensational story of Rod Blagojevich’s political fall, and the case of Amadou Diallo, an unarmed African immigrant who was shot 41 times by police…2020-05-01T14:00:00Z

In 2004, Scrushy was charged by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission after a lengthy FBI investigation into his accounting fraud that involved $2.7 billion over the course of six years, from 1996 to 2002, according to USA Today.

The SEC originally brought 85 counts of various fraud charges against him, with 36 making it all the way to trial. He was the first CEO charged with violating the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which is an act “An Act To protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of corporate disclosures made pursuant to the securities laws, and for other purposes.” It also protects whistleblowers.

Scrushy was acquitted of all charges during his Birmingham jury trial in 2005. However, four months later, Scrushy was indicted by a federal grand jury alongside former Alabama Governor Don Siegelman on 30 counts of bribery, extortion, money laundering, obstruction, and racketeering. In 2006, both men were convicted.

According to the New York Times, the jurors convicted Scrushy of bribery, conspiracy, and mail fraud, the last of which carries the longest jail term. In June 2007, Scrushy was sentenced to six years, 10 months in federal prison and ordered to pay $267,000 in restitution to United Way of Alabama, a fine of $150,000, and was put on three years’ probation. Siegelman earned a similar sentence but his sentence was one year longer.

However, in 2009, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court upheld Scrushy’s charges but dismissed two of the seven against Siegelman.

On July 26, 2012, Scrushy was released from federal custody. U.S. District Court Judge Mark Fuller, who presided over the 2006 trial, trimmed Scrushy sentence by a year due to his ministry work while in prison and Scrushy’s plea about being separated from his family, according to the Montgomery Advertiser.

But Scrushy also faced a civil suit from former HealthSouth investors seeking compensation for their money lost due to Scrushy’s fraud. In June 2009, Judge Allwin Horn ordered Scrushy to pay $2.87 billion in restitution. According to Alabama.com, Scrushy’s net worth was divulged over the course of the trial; it was at least $287 million in 2004. Scrushy appealed that verdict but lost his appeal.",convicted on fraud

Dragomir Vasic in a campaign video for last year’s elections in Bosnia.

The Bosnian state court on Thursday confirmed the indictment of Bosnian Serb lawmaker Vasic and two other former police officials from Zvornik for taking part in the Srebrenica genocide in July 1995.

Vasic was the commander of the Zvornik police headquarters and chief of the Public Security Center in the town in the summer of 1995, when Bosnian Serb forces killed more than 7,000men and boys and forcibly removed 40,000 civilians from Srebrenica.

He was elected to the Republika Srpska People’s Assembly in last October’s general elections as a candidate of the Serb Democratic Party founded by Radovan Karadzic, who is on trial in The Hague for genocide in Srebrenica and other crimes during the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

The indictment against Vasic also charges Danilo Zoljic and Radomir Pantic, former commander of Special Police Units in Zvornik and former commander of the first platoon of the Special Police Units respectively, with genocide in Srebrenica.

Vasic is charged with participating in a criminal enterprise, while Zoljic and Pantic are accused of aiding and abetting the genocide.

All three defendants have been charged with taking part in the planning and realisation of the genocide by ordering the use of manpower and police equipment for the capture and forcible separation of Bosniak men and boys after the fall of the UN-protected Srebrenica enclave to Serb forces in July 1995.

“The defendants participated in planning and carrying out the arrest of prisoners, their transportation to sites of mass execution, as well as carrying out the executions of several thousand Bosniak men at Kozluk, Branjevo, Pilica and other places,” the indictment says.

The prosecution also charges them with burying the victims in mass graves and with exhuming and removing the bodies to secondary mass graves in order to conceal the crime.

When Vasic testified in a trial at the Hague Tribunal in 2009, he said that on the evening of July 13, 1995, he met Ljubisa Beara, the security chief of the Bosnian Serb Army Main Staff, who told him that his military commander Ratko Mladic had ordered that “all prisoners [from Srebrenica] be killed”.

The Tribunal sentenced Beara to life imprisonment for the Srebrenica genocide but an appeal is currently under way. Mladic is also on trial for genocide and other crimes.

Maksida Piric, the spokesperson for the Bosnian Electoral Commission, told local media on Thursday that despite the indictment, there is no legal way to take away Vasic’s mandate.

She explained that only people who are serving sentences or are wanted under warrants can be denied mandates according to electoral law.",

SPECTACULARLY prosperous Minister of Home Affairs and Culture, Dr Obert Moses Mpofu, owns a vast array of upmarket tourism-related assets in the tourist resort town of Victoria Falls, despite his spirited denials, as recently published in the press.

The assets of Khanondo Safaris and Tours, a company to which he is linked, include luxury guest houses, as well as residential and industrial properties and stands. Movable assets include two cruise boats and a wide range of vehicles for hire. They include luxury cars, game-viewing vehicles and airport transport buses, servicing both Victoria Falls Airport and Livingstone Airport across the Zambezi River in Zambia.

Mpofu served as Minister of Mines and Mining Development between 2009 and 2013. It is during that period that Mpofu is widely alleged to have corruptly enriched himself.

Mpofu’s ownership of such vast assets of dubious origin must be a cause of concern for President Emmerson Dambudzo Mnangagwa, who has pegged the future of his presidency on a bid to eradicate corruption, among other goals. Half-hearted efforts by the Parliament of Zimbabwe to enforce accountability on Mpofu have, however, failed to bring the aggressive minister to book.

The Parliamentary Portfolio Committee for Mines and Energy, under the chairmanship of mercurial Norton legislator, Themba Mliswa, is fighting against heavy odds to establish the whereabouts of billions of dollars in diamond revenue alleged to have gone missing over the years. Also on the agenda of the committee is an investigation into the source of Mpofu’s vast wealth. In March 2018, businessman Lovemore Kurotwi the director of Core Mining and Mineral Resources, told Mliswa’s committee that Mpofu had demanded a $10 million bribe from him in return for a mining concession at Chiadzwa in 2009.

In January NewsDay carried a report to the effect that Kurotwi had filed a report with the Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission on 22 January 2018. Kurotwi alleged that Mpofu had seized from his company 1, 34 million carats of diamonds, which were in the custody of the Minerals Marketing Corporation of Zimbabwe and converted them to his own personal benefit.

“We write to request that you investigate the current minister of Home Affairs, Obert Mpofu, over known corruption which he has committed but which now seems to be swept under the carpet either for reasons of ignorance of the said corruption by the relevant authorities or reasons of impunity or both,” Kurotwi wrote.

Kurotwi claimed that he had been arrested for fraud after he reported Mpofu to former President Mugabe. He said he was acquitted by the High Court because the charges had been concocted by the Minister. He reported to ZACC that he had also brought to the attention of Mugabe the matter of the $10 million allegedly demanded by Mpofu in return for mining concessions at Chiadzwa. Kurotwi said he had also reported Mpofu to President Emmerson Mnangagwa over the same issue two weeks before approaching ZACC.

“During the time, my so-called fraud case was still sub judice, Mpofu further took advantage (of) the sub judice position and confiscated 1, 4 million carats of our diamonds which were in our vaults in Mutare and $10.6 million which was in the custody of the Minerals Marketing Corporation of Zimbabwe,” Kurotwi stated.

He said efforts to recover both the money and the diamonds had been in vain, with officials in the ministry either professing total ignorance of the matter or pointing in the direction of Mpofu.

There was drama when Mpofu himself appeared before the same Parliamentary Committee. He angrily refused to testify, citing personal differences with Mliswa. The committee’s examination of Mpofu virtually ground to a halt on that controversial note, when he refused to cooperate if Mliswa was chairman. There was a public outcry when Mpofu was allowed to get away with what amounted to an arrogant display of impunity.

Observers expressed surprise that, in the circumstances, Mliswa did not recuse himself from chairing the committee, instead of sacrificing its work over what appeared to be personal differences with Mpofu.

Meanwhile, Mpofu granted an interview published in The Daily News on 23 March 2018. He opened up on what he claimed to be the source of his enormous wealth, claiming he had earned all of it from his own hard work and sweat. The minister also proclaimed that anyone who alleges that he owns any large assortment of assets in Victoria Falls has to be “an idiot peddling nonsense”.

But it now turns out that, notwithstanding his vehement denials, Mpofu does own an extensive range of both movable and immovable assets in the popular tourist resort town.

During the interview with The Daily News, Mpofu also rubbished any suggestion that he dominates the real estate sector in Victoria Falls. He stated categorically that he owns no property in the resort town and challenged anyone with documentary proof of such ownership of the alleged properties to produce such evidence.

Several newspaper stories over the years have directly linked Mpofu to Khanondo Safari and Tours. He did not protest when these various newspapers referred to him as the owner of Khanondo, despite the negative implications, especially with regard to tax obligations.

On Thursday and Friday, 19 and 20 April, 2018, I made several attempts to reach Mpofu by telephone but in vain, in a bid to obtain comment from him. I then visited his office at Mukwati Buildings on the Friday morning. He was said to be out of the office, attending a meeting. I gave my number to his secretary and implored her to call me at the earliest opportunity. I impressed upon her the importance and urgency of the matter, which was in his own interest.

By the end of that day I had not heard from the minister. Neither had I heard from his office by Monday, 30 April.

On 20 September 2016, NewsDay published an article about the well-heeled minister under the headline, “Mpofu’s business empire crumbles”. Mpofu was reported to be faced with potential loss of 50 properties which he had reportedly tendered as surety to secure a $2 million loan from CBZ Bank. The bank had taken the case to the High Court after he defaulted on repayments.

“The Zanu-PF secretary for finance – who owns companies such as Trebo and Khays, Maminza Transport, and Khanondo Safaris and Tours – could be sitting on a crumbling business empire after some of his movable properties reportedly went under the hammer over an outstanding debt last year,” Newsday reported.

“Macro-Economic Planning and Investment Promotion Minister Obert Mpofu’s business empire has reportedly hit the rocks, with most of his business units facing litigation over non-payment of services rendered,” the article continued.

It proceeded to list Khanondo Safaris and Tours among the companies affected. NewsDay editor Wisdom Mudzungairi says Mpofu never challenged his newspaper to produce documentary evidence that he was the owner of this or many other companies listed by the newspaper as being owned by him.

Six months later, Bulawayo24, an online publication, reported on 15 March 2017, that Mpofu was set to lose 50 properties over a $2 million debt.

On 12 December 2017, the Bulawayo-based government-controlled daily newspaper, The Chronicle, carried yet another story about Mpofu’s business empire. It was published under the headline, “Minister’s company sues over debt.”

According to this article, “Mpofu’s company, Khanondo Safaris and Tours, has taken a Victoria Falls construction firm to court over a debt of more than $15 000.”

Apparently the defaulting contractor had bought building materials on credit from none other than Khanondo Hardware, a Khanondo subsidiary.

Unchallenged references

There exists in the public domain a litany of unchallenged references to Mpofu as the owner of, not only Khanondo Safaris and Tours, but also of other companies as well. None of the publications that have repeatedly published such information has, either voluntarily or at the behest of the minister, produced any documentary evidence that he is the owner of the companies.

It is these uncontested news reports that have instilled in the public mind the perception that Mpofu does own much of Victoria Falls as well as a plethora of other immovable assets in Bulawayo and elsewhere, as alleged.

But it was the Daily News article which prompted a vigorous challenge of Mpofu’s position vis a vis ownership of properties in Victoria Falls and elsewhere. Some months before publication of the article, Khanondo Safaris and Tours engaged a consultant to perform certain services for the company in Victoria Falls. During this assignment, the consultant became familiar with the full range of the organization’s operations in the town that is apart from gaining knowledge of the special position occupied by Mpofu in the thriving company.

The consultant says he thought he had done a good job. Khanondo then committed a critical error. They failed to pay him his dues. After months of frustration, the consultant duly approached me with details of his woeful story.

“They failed to pay me for my services,” he protested, “yet they are making so much money. Now Minister Mpofu denies in The Daily News that he owns anything in Victoria Falls. Well, I know he does.”

Back in 2010, during his tenure as chairperson of the Parliamentary Committee on Mines and Energy, the late Edward Chindori-Chininga, who was a former Minister of Mines, reportedly declared Mpofu to be “a crook and a thief”. He then told Charles Ray, then United States Ambassador to Zimbabwe, on 21 January 2010, that Mpofu had entered into unauthorized partnerships with Mbada and Canadile, both of them mining companies, to exploit diamond deposits in Marange.

Chindori-Chininga released a damning report in June 2013, about the alleged involvement of Zanu PF officials and their allies in the diamond industry. The report revealed that millions of dollars in royalties, paid by various diamond companies, had literally disappeared. The report also divulged crucial information pertaining to how Mpofu, as Minister of Mines, had allegedly “stacked the Zimbabwe Mining Development Corporation with his cronies, sister-in-law, personal assistant and people with zero mining experience.”

Unfortunately, Chindori-Chininga died in a car crash just one week after his report was published. The incriminating report appears to have died a natural death of its own.

Googling of Khanondo Safaris and Tours reveals the vast array of assets owned by Mpofu through Khanondo Safaris and Tours. The company is described on its website as “a quality-oriented and reputable leisure and hospitality operator based in Victoria Falls. Khanondo Safaris offers tours in Victoria Falls and around Zimbabwe, Tour of the Falls, Zambezi Cruises, Rafting, Game Drives, Car Hire, Airport Transfers, VIP Transfers and many other travel services.”

“I am aware of the nonsense that has been peddled by political and social opponents who feel challenged by my success,” Mpofu fumed in The Daily News of 23 March 2018.

“I am proud of what I have and no one will take what I have sweated for because I have worked for everything that I have.

“The most expensive asset I have is the famous seven-storey York House Building, which the family bought from Old Mutual in 1998. The Victoria Falls nonsense that I own all or most of it is as stupid as the idiots who are peddling it. Can they list those assets so that I can take ownership of them if they ever exist?”

Reward for Willowgate

Mpofu shocked newspaper readers when he claimed, while testifying as a witness in the then ongoing High Court fraud trial of Core Mining and Mineral Resources director, Lovemore Kurotwi, that among the sources of his immense wealth was a reward that he received from the government of former President Robert Mugabe for his role as whistleblower in the Willowgate Scandal which I investigated and published. in 1988 when I was editor of The Chronicle. Mpofu claimed that a part of this alleged bonus had gone towards the purchase of York House in Bulawayo.

I immediately challenged Mpofu in an article published in Newsday on 8 October 2014. I questioned that the minister should have received what appeared to be very significant compensation for being my whistleblower yet I was fired from my position as editor for investigating and exposing the Willowgate Scandal on the basis of a misdirected cheque from Willowvale Mazda Motors that was received and put at my disposal.by the same Mpofu.

Mpofu never responded. Neither did anyone else offer any explanation in the Mugabe government, which was notorious for being lax in matters of corruption. Given the new circumstances of Zimbabwe politically and in the interests of transparency and accountability, Mpofu must feel obliged to produce proof or evidence of the Willowgate gratuity that enabled him to invest in York House. It remains my resolute conviction, however, that Mpofu was being economic with the truth and he did this while he was testifying in court under oath, which amounts to perjury

There has been public agitation, especially on social media, that Mpofu be held accountable following his boast and his challenge as published in The Daily New, in particular, and in the context of President Mnangagwa’s much- acclaimed onslaught on corruption, in general. The minister recently announced his decision to stand down as a candidate for Umguza Constituency in the forthcoming harmonized elections.

Mpofu’s predecessor as Home Affairs Minister, Ignatius Chombo, was dramatically arrested as November 2017’s Operation Restore Legacy got underway in Harare, signaling the downfall of former President Robert Mugabe. Subsequently appearing at Rotten Row Magistrates’ Courts in leg irons, he was put on trial for alleged corruption and abuse of office. The vast extent of Chombo’s wealth had earlier been revealed during court proceedings when he and his wife, Marion Chombo, divorced.

Judging by appearances, it is arguable that Mpofu is the wealthier of the two successive Home Affairs Ministers.

That there is no documentary proof of Mpofu’s name being directly connected to Khanondo Safaris and Tours is understandable. It is common practice in Zimbabwe for government officials or other entrepreneurs to exploit the age-old strategy, whereby they will register a company or companies in the names of proxies, usually relatives, friends or business associates.

While documentary proof directly linking him to ownership of the said properties may not be readily available, other proof exists that the vehicle of Mpofu’s ownership of the assets in Victoria Falls is his company, Khanondo Safaris and Tours. According to a report following an investigation by the Political Action Committee (PAC), which was published in November 2012, Mpofu also owns the following companies: Trebo and Khays, through which he acquired the now defunct Allied Bank, originally the Zimbabwe Allied Banking Group (ZABG), Maminza Properties, Maminza Transport, Khanondo Car Hire, Horseshow Estate, KoMpofu La Sports Bar, Luna Rainbow Tours, Paradise Guest Lodge, Good Memories Lodge, Mswelangubo Farm, New Miners Restaurant (Hwange), Accut and Crews Village, Moya Security and Matetsi Meat Butchery.

4 000-strong herd of cattle

Mpofu’s Winter Block ranch is reported to hold stock of a 4 000-strong herd of cattle. Mpofu’s herd of cattle is said to be “clearly a big source of personal pride and legitimate revenue”, the PAC report says. It says he owns a herd of about 3 000 breeding cattle, and uses a feedlot in Umguza to fatten another herd of about a 1 000 at a time. It quotes Mpofu’s farm manager, one Dumisani Moyo, as claiming that they “sell about 50 cattle every week and the profits are good”.

A herd of such magnitude must have cost Mpofu a substantial amount of money to build.

In 2012, Mpofu who trained as a journalist in India, launched a short-lived newspaper, The Zimbabwe Mail, which is now defunct.

The PAC report also highlighted that since he became Minister of Mines, one of Mpofu’s companies, Maminza Transport, acquired eight Volvo FH12 haulage trucks and some drilling equipment. The trucks were, at the time the report was released in 2012, parked at the depot of the former Clan Transport along Plumtree Road in Bulawayo. Both trucks and drilling equipment were subsequently spotted at Hwange Colliery, a state-owned coal mine whose operations came under the ambit of Mpofu’s portfolio as Minister of Mines.

The report says, “The trucks, which retail at over $100,000 apiece, are decaled with ‘Maminza Transport’ signs on the doors and ‘OMM’- (for Obert Moses Mpofu)-and a sequential number stenciled above the windscreen.”

Accompanying this article is a large number of images of assets that belong to Khanondo Safaris and Tours in Victoria Falls. The company’s website carries hundreds of other images depicting guest houses and their luxurious interiors, two cruise boats, upmarket sedans and SUV’s, including the iconic Hummer, for hire, game viewing vehicles, as well as two transfer buses.

The website also boasts of more than 30 images of Mpofu himself in various poses, as if to dispel any lingering doubt in the public mind as to who is boss at Khanondo Safaris and Tours.

Mpofu embarked on a spree of acquisition and massive construction or development of some of his properties during a period of national economic hardship, when most other businesses in the premier resort town and elsewhere in Zimbabwe, were just managing to remain open, were scaling down their operations or closing down altogether.

The amazingly high standards set all round as well as the magnitude of the conglomerate could only have been achieved by an entrepreneur with easy access to loads of capital. The Minister of Information Communication Technology and Cyber Security, Supa Mandiwanzira spoke on ZiFM radio station recently. He lamented the fact that he earns a salary of what he called a paltry $4 000 a month. Mpofu built a business empire on the same “paltry” remuneration as government minister and earlier as provincial governor.

This definitely defies logic, especially given that between 2010 and 2012 his net salary was less than $2 000 a month.

For several years Mpofu treated the ownership of his vast business empire as a closely guarded secret. However, in December 2011, a bout of big-headedness got the better of the minister. He unwittingly booked a 16-page advertising supplement in The Chronicle to sing praises of his own business acumen and achievements. This was a gross error of judgement. Zimbabweans were thus offered a rare opportunity to peep into his business conglomerate, whose details were indelibly printed on the pages of the newspaper.

Minister with a diamond touch

The supplement was supported by his many companies with advertising. It celebrated Mpofu’s 60 th birthday, as well as his then recently acquired Doctorate in Policy Studies from the distance-based Zimbabwe Open University. Among the articles published in the supplement were some in which relatives extolled Mpofu’s virtues as “the minister with (a) diamond touch”, “a leader of quality and stead” and “a true people’s servant”.

The irony of referring to the Minister of Mines as the minister “with a diamond touch” at a time when diamonds worth millions of dollars were suffering a mysterious disappearance from the Chiyadzwa Diamond Fields, could not have been lost on perceptive Chronicle readers, given the allegation that Mpofu was enriching himself on Chiyadzwa diamonds.

Mpofu’s salvation was that during the Mugabe era citizens were not given to the voicing of such serious concerns as publicly as they do now under the New Dispensation of President Mnangagwa.

Among the companies which advertised in the Chronicle supplement were Trebo and Khays, Maminza Properties, Maminza Transport, Khanondo Safaris and Tours, Khanondo Car Hire, Horseshow Estate, KoMpofu La Sports Bar, Luna Rainbow Tours, Guest Paradise Lodge, Good Memories Lodge, Mswelangubo Farm, New Miners Restaurant (Hwange), Accut and Crews Village, Moya Security and Matetsi Meat Butchery.

According to PAC, a most detailed, but unconfirmed report, “listed cash-purchases of a supermarket in Victoria Falls’ Chinotimba high density suburb, three houses in a medium-density area, two cruise boats on the Zambezi, five houses in Mkhosana high-density suburb, three houses in Chinotimba, two industrial stands, one large stand in Chisuma, one big industrial stand next to Chinotimba Stadium, four industrial stands on the Airport Road, and four medium-density plots.”

The PAC report listed the following as being among Mpofu’s landholdings:

10 006ha, North Part, Umguza Block. This is property formerly owned by the Cold Storage Commission (CSC) and is known specifically as Blocks 39, 40 and 41.
1 027ha, Auchenburg Farm, Nyamandlovu.
Green Haven Farm. Located close to the Umguza River just outside Bulawayo on the Victoria Falls road. This is a farm Mpofu has reportedly owned for some time and where he keeps most of his herd.
3 700ha, Umguza CSC Block.
2 300ha, Young Farm, Nyamandlovu.
8 000ha, Horseshoe Ranch, Matetsi. It is believed Mpofu bought this property from Bill Bedford in 2008 for an undisclosed sum. At the time of publication of the report in 2012, hunting and safari operations were run by one Shaun Kearney, a South African.
100ha, in Epping Forest B Section, a part of Accut and Crew, formerly a white-owned farm bought by government for resettlement in 1996. Now referred to as Mswelangubo Farm, it serves as Mpofu’s main residence. The property underwent extensive upgrades, including approximately $150 000 spent on fencing and paving ahead of the lavish December 2011 birthday bash. The cost of this party was estimated at another $250,000.

In March 2012 a 10-kilometre stretch of road to this house was resurfaced, rather fittingly, by a brand new Caterpillar excavator. The report says the Umguza Rural Council would not, in any way, have afforded to undertake such project. Several other commercial ventures, including a horticultural business, an abattoir and a chicken factory, were reportedly established on the property.

In addition to the above listings of approximately 25 000ha, PAC discovered that Mpofu also controls Winter Block, a 40 000ha section of land next to Umguza Block. A source with inside knowledge of the Cold Storage Commission land holdings confirmed this to be an entirely separate parcel of land. It was reported that after the land invasions of 2000, Winter Block had been largely divided between former Vice-President Joseph Msika and Bulawayo High Court Judge Maphios Cheda.

“Msika died in 2009 and Cheda has maintained only a minimal interest in the area after being awarded another farm in 2008,” says the report. “Since then Mpofu has primarily used Winter Block to graze his cattle, which he has boasted is the biggest herd in Zimbabwe. With total farm holdings of at least 65 000ha, this would also place Mpofu amongst the country’s biggest landowners.”

Zimbabwean legislation does not permit an individual to own more than one farm.

A more comprehensive list of Mpofu’s properties in Bulawayo has been reserved for a follow-up article. The list has been in the public domain for the past six years.

Obert Mpofu was born on 12 October 1951 into an average rural family in Jambezi Village in the district of Hwange, in Matabeleland North. From such humble beginnings he has risen over recent years to the pinnacle of opulence in Victoria Falls and Bulawayo and political influence in Harare in which he now finds himself happily ensconced conveniently as powerful Minister of Home affairs.

During the Rhodesian war of liberation the Mpofu family, like the majority of other families in Matabeleland, supported Dr Joshua Nkomo’s Zimbabwe African People’s Union (ZAPU), which operated from Zambia, while President Robert Mugabe’s Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU) was based in Mozambique.

It is reported that in his late teens Mpofu was recruited for training under renowned ZIPRA commander, Nikita Mangena; but was dismissed not long afterwards, after he was allegedly deemed to be both “untrainable and divisive within the camp”.

Mpofu later left for India, like a number of other black Rhodesian youths. While there, he studied journalism at the University of New Delhi. On return he worked briefly as a reporter in Lusaka, but does not appear to have pursued a career as a journalist in Zimbabwe. Instead, he became a line manager at Zimbabwe Newspapers in Harare. Mpofu also had a stint with Customs and Excise, also in Harare. He left amid allegations of corruption.

It was at about this time that Mpofu allegedly changed his political allegiance from PF-ZAPU to Zanu-PF under the tutelage of the late Enos Mzombi Nkala, the fiery Zanu-PF politician from Matabeleland and a fierce adversary of the late Dr Joshua Nkomo. The hostility between these two politicians had earlier indirectly led to the outbreak of the Gukurahundi atrocities, during which thousands of innocent civilians were massacred by the Zimbabwe National Army’s Five Brigade.

Since his political conversion Mpofu has never looked back.

He was appointed general manager of the Zimbabwe Grain Bag Company, a new enterprise established by Zanu-PF in the city of Bulawayo. It was during this period that he received the cheque from Willowvale Mazda Motor Industries that he brought to me at The Chronicle, thus triggering the investigation that resulted in the Willowgate Scandal in a bid to fight incipient corruption within the ranks of the Mugabe government. Now Mpofu claims that for the simple act of showing me a misdirected cheque he was paid enough money for him to invest in a seven-storey building in Bulawayo. Meanwhile I was fired from The Chronicle and proceeded to endure periods of suffering and starvation, while being severely victimised.

Mpofu’s shrewd political transformation opened doors and launched his career as a Zanu-PF politician, being appointed Governor of Matabeleland in 2000 and as Minister of Industry and International Trade in 2005. In 2009 he literally hit the jackpot on appointment as Minister of Mines.

As he rose through the ranks of government Mpofu tried his hand at business and succeeded. He built the empire which encompasses his flagship companies – Trebo and Khays, Maminza Transport and Khanondo Safaris and Tours.

The much talked about magnitude and questionable origin of Mpofu’s business empire and enormous wealth have potential to impact negatively on President Mnangagwa and Zanu-PF’s fortunes in the pending harmonized elections.",allegation of corruption

The Ohio House expelled its Republican speaker in a unanimous, bipartisan vote after he was charged in connection with a $60 million bribery scheme.

Rep. Larry Householder and four others were arrested on July 21 and charged as part of a racketeering and bribery probe that investigators called “the largest bribery, money-laundering scheme against the people of the state of Ohio.”

According to local news reports, Householder has not spoken publicly about the case.

The arrests were part of a yearlong investigation into public corruption and bribery tied to legislation that bailed out two nuclear power plants in the state. The former speaker and his associates are accused of accepting corporate money for personal and political use to pass House Bill 6 to financially bail out two FirstEnergy nuclear plants with over $1 billion.

Householder was a key player in the legislation, which added a fee to every electric bill in the state and directed over $150 million a year through 2026 to the plants near Cleveland and Toledo.

“This is the most important thing that we’ve done today,"" said GOP Rep. Bob Cupp, a former Ohio Supreme Court justice who is a potential candidate to be the next speaker. ""There is no doubt that people feel betrayed, used, and it's been a stain on the House, and people want to make sure we begin anew.”

Householder is the first Ohio House Speaker ever removed by the chamber.

Remaining members of Householder’s leadership team have said he deserves the presumption of innocence but “lost the trust of his colleagues and the public” and couldn’t effectively lead the House. Householder had been asked to step down by colleagues in both parties but refused.

Householder, former Ohio GOP chairman Matt Borges, lobbyist Neil Clark, lobbyist and Ohio Civil Rights Commission member Juan Cespedes and political consultant Jeff Longstreth could all face up to 20 years in prison if convicted for their alleged work to pass the bailout and block attempts to overturn it, according to a criminal complaint filed by the FBI.

Borges’ lawyer Karl Schneider said his client’s involvement in the case has been “wildly overstated.”

Householder had been speaker since 2019 after previously having the position from 2001 to 2004. He left office due to term limits but rejoined the House in 2017. He was seen as one of the most powerful and influential state lawmakers in Ohio.

Previous attempts to bail out the nuclear plants had stalled in the legislature before Householder became speaker. Months after taking over, he rolled out a new plan to subsidize the plants and eliminate renewable energy incentives. The proposal was approved a year ago despite opposition from many business leaders and the manufacturing industry.

This is also not the first time Householder has been investigated for questionable practices.

At the time he left office, he and several top advisers were under federal investigation for alleged money laundering and irregular campaign practices. The government closed the case without filing charges.

Householder is the second Ohio House speaker to come under investigation in just over two years.

Former Republican Speaker Cliff Rosenberger was investigated in 2018 amid an FBI inquiry into his travel, lavish lifestyle and a condo he rented from a wealthy GOP donor. Rosenberger, who has maintained he broke no laws, has not been charged, but the investigation remains open.",money laundering

Computer antivirus pioneer John McAfee tweeted last year that he hadn't filed a tax return in eight years.

It was OK, he explained. He was ""done making money."" His ""net income is negative.""

""Taxation is illegal,"" he said.

Now McAfee has been arrested in Spain on tax evasion charges. The U.S. Justice Department has accused him of failing to file tax returns from 2014 to 2018 despite making millions, according to an indictment unsealed Monday.

He is accused of making money from ""promoting crypto-currencies, consulting work, speaking engagements and selling the rights to his life story for a documentary."" His extradition to the U.S. is pending, according to the Justice Department.

Prosecutors said he evaded taxes by directing his income to be paid into bank accounts and cryptocurrency exchange accounts set up in others' names, according to the indictment. He also allegedly concealed assets, including real property, a vehicle and a yacht, by putting them in other people's names.

I have not filed a tax return for 8 years. Why? 1: taxation is illegal. 2: I paid tens of millions already and received Jack Shit in services. 3. I'm done making money. I live off of cash from McAfee Inc. My net income is negative. But i am a prime target for the IRS. Here I am.

He could face up to 30 years in prison and $1.75 million in fines if convicted.

McAfee was once a prominent figure in the software sector.

He founded McAfee LLC, which Intel bought for $7.68 billion in 2010. The company was not cited in the indictment.

But in recent years, he's made international headlines for other reasons: his involvement in a murder investigation in Belize, a failed presidential bid, deportation from Guatemala, and his detention in the Dominican Republic, to name a few.

In 2012, he abandoned his residence in Belize after his neighbor, Gregory Faull, was killed. He fled to Guatemala after being made a person of interest — not a suspect — in the case and said he feared for his life.

He reportedly was in Belize in the first place to lower his taxes.

Eventually, his location in Guatemala was revealed through the metadata of a photo posted by Vice Magazine online. He was arrested over entering the country illegally and was deported back to the United States.

Then, last year, a U.S. District Court ordered McAfee to pay $25 million in a wrongful death lawsuit in Faull's death, according to the Florida Record.

McAfee said he would not pay and he was ""never suspected of murder"" in a statement he posted to Twitter in March 2019.

""I have not responded to a single one of my 37 lawsuits for the past 11 years. They have all been frivolous,"" he wrote, calling the order ""the legal extortion game aimed at America's wealthy class.""

He claimed to have ""no assets"" and said he couldn't pay, even if a lawsuit demanded it.

On Monday, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a complaint in the Southern District of New York against McAfee.

The complaint claimed McAfee ""leveraged his fame"" to make more than $23 million wrongfully from 2017 to 2018.

McAfee is accused of recommending initial coin offerings of cryptocurrency to his Twitter followers without disclosing he was being paid. Instead, he passed it off as unbiased investment advice.

At the time of this writing he has 1 million Twitter followers.

Amid his international escapades, McAfee also made a foray into U.S. politics. He had two bids for U.S. president, first in 2016 and briefly again in 2020.

After originally floating the idea of creating his own party, called the Cyber Party, he ran both times as a Libertarian. He failed to secure the party's nomination either time.

A Twitter account bearing his wife's name, Janice McAfee, posted a statement Tuesday defending her husband (and noting that both her and her husband's accounts are ""staffed by interns."") Her statement, retweeted by John McAfee's account, said a team of lawyers are working to assist him.

TMML2024036974410,Juan Manuel Santos,"Alert ID: TMML2024036974410
Colombia’s Supreme Court on Friday called President Juan Manuel Santos and 18 of his (former) ministers to testify over a bribery scandal involving Brazilian engineering firm Odebrecht.

The request was made by the defense attorney of Senator Bernardo Miguel Elias (U Party), who was arrested by prosecution officials on Thursday for allegedly receiving $9 million in bribes.

(Former) ministers called to testify

German Vargas (former vice-president)
Mauricio Cardenas (finance minister)
Maria Angela Holguin (foreign minister)
Aurelio Iragorri (agriculture minister)
Mariana Garces (culture minister)
Alejandro Gaviria (health minister)
Juan Fernando Cristo (former interior minister)
Tomas Gonzalez (former mining minister)
Gina Parody (former education minister)
Juan Carlos Pinzon (former defense minister)
Luis Felipe Henao (former housing minister)
Yesid Reyes (former justice minister)
Luis Eduardo Garzon (former labor minister)
Natalia Abello (former transport minister)
Cecilia Alvarez (former trade minister)
Gabriel Vallejo (former environment minister)
Diego Molano (former technology minister)
Simon Gaviria (National Planning Department director)

The senator’s defense had asked the court to call all witnesses of the act that granted Odebrecht a major road construction project to testify.

The president’s successful 2010 and 2014 election campaigns were already under investigation for allegedly allowing illegal Odebrecht contributions to finance Santos’ political ambitions.

However, with the calling to testify of 18 (former) executives, the scandal has reached not just Santos’ electoral machine, but the highest echelons of power in the country.

Mutually beneficial alliance becomes mutually destructive

The move appears to be an act of revenge of the senator who was long one of Santos’ key power brokers in the Pacific region, but fell out of presidential grace after being linked to the $27 million bribery scandal.

While far from Colombia’s largest corruption scandal since Santos took office, the bribery investigation has already spurred the withdrawal of opposition presidential candidate Oscar Ivan Zuluaga (Democratic Center) and has, more importantly, spurred a public apology by Santos.

The senator in the corner

According to a leaked testimony by jailed former Congressman Otto Bulla, Elias would have received $9 million while another $4.5 million in bribes was reserved for “other politicians managed by Federico” Gaviria, a businessman also in jail for his alleged corruption.

The evidence and testimonies presented by the prosecution indicate that the office is seeking to turn Elias into a state witness, which in turn could lead to the arrest of more sitting congressmen at little more than half a year before national elections.

Colombia’s prosecution opened a criminal investigation after the United States Department of Justice revealed that Odebrecht allegedly had spent more than $11 million in bribes to obtain road infrastructure contracts in Colombia.

This, however, appeared to be a low estimate after claims by Colombia’s Prosecutor General that the Brazilian company had bribed government and elected officials for $27 million.",

WASHINGTON—Diego Montoya Sanchez, 48, one of the leaders of the Norte Valle Colombian drug cartel and a former FBI Top Ten Fugitive, pleaded guilty today in Miami to drug trafficking, murder, and racketeering charges, the Justice Department announced.

The pleas were announced by Acting U. S. Attorney Jeffrey H. Sloman for the Southern District of Florida, Acting U.S. Attorney Lev L. Dassin for the Southern District of New York, Assistant Attorney General Lanny A. Breuer of the Criminal Division, FBI Executive Assistant Director Thomas J. Harrington and Acting Administrator Michele M. Leonhart of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration.

Montoya Sanchez appeared before U.S. District Judge Cecilia M. Altonaga in Miami, where he pleaded guilty in two pending federal cases. In the first case, which was indicted in the Southern District of Florida by the U.S. Attorney's Office, Montoya pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to import more than five kilograms of cocaine into the United States and one count of obstruction of justice by murder.

In the second case, which was indicted in the District of Columbia jointly by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York (SDNY) and the Criminal Division's Narcotic and Dangerous Drug Section (NDDS), Montoya Sanchez pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to engage in a pattern of racketeering activity. The SDNY/NDDS indictment was transferred to the Southern District of Florida for the guilty plea.

Following the decline of the Cali Cartel in the mid-1990s, the Norte Valle Cartel emerged to become Colombia's most prolific cocaine trafficking cartel. Based upon FBI estimates, at its peak the Norte Valle Cartel was responsible for 60 percent of the cocaine exported from Colombia to the United States. According to the SDNY/NDDS indictment, between 1990 and 2004, the Norte Valle Cartel exported more than 1.2 million pounds, or 500 metric tons, of cocaine worth more than $10 billion from Colombia to the United States.

According to the statement of facts submitted in conjunction with today's hearing, Montoya Sanchez was a high-level Colombian drug trafficker for more than two decades. In the mid-1980s, Montoya Sanchez ran cocaine laboratories that served many significant traffickers. In the late 1980s, Montoya Sanchez expanded his organization's operations into smuggling plane loads of cocaine from Colombia to Mexico. According to the statement of facts, by the early 1990s, Montoya Sanchez had switched to maritime smuggling. During the course of the next 15 years, Montoya Sanchez's organization routinely smuggled cocaine loads between 1,000 and 6,000 kilos at a time using go-fast boats and fishing boats, among other methods.

By the late 1990s, Montoya Sanchez and Wilber Varela emerged to become the Norte Valle Cartel's two leading kingpins. Mounting tensions between the Montoya and Varela organizations led to a two-year war between the organizations in which each targeted the other's members for murder. The Montoya-Varela war, which lasted from fall 2003 until fall 2005, resulted in hundreds of deaths, including those of innocent civilians.

At today's hearing, Montoya Sanchez admitted that his organization's practices included using violence and murder against people his organization feared were cooperating with law enforcement. Montoya Sanchez specifically admitted to the August 2003 murder of a one-time organization member who was believed to have been cooperating with authorities.

In May 2004, the FBI added Montoya Sanchez to its list of ten most wanted fugitives. On Sept. 10, 2007, Colombian authorities mounted an operation on a believed Montoya hide-out at a ranch in a rural area outside of Zarzal, Valle del Cauca, Colombia, and captured Montoya Sanchez hiding in a creek-bed approximately 700 yards from the ranch. Montoya Sanchez was extradited from Colombia to Miami on Dec. 12, 2008.

Jeffrey H. Sloman, Acting U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida, stated, ""From the prosecution and conviction of the leaders of the Cali Cartel, to the conviction of Ze'ev Rosenstein and an Israel-based Ecstasy network, to today's dismantling of the Norte Valle Cartel, the Southern District of Florida has had a long and successful history in the war on drugs. We will continue to focus our energy, and the expertise of our prosecutors, to help our law enforcement partners stem the tide of drugs flooding our streets and poisoning our society.""

""Diego Montoya Sanchez was the leader of a dangerous, violent drug organization,"" said Thomas J. Harrington, Executive Assistant Director of the FBI. ""Outstanding cooperation between Colombia and the United States was key to his capture, the capture of others, and the effective dismantling of the Norte Valle Cartel. The FBI and its law enforcement partners, both here and overseas, will continue to work together to eliminate other international organized crime threats.""

""The prosecution of Montoya Sanchez is a milestone in the efforts to dismantle the Norte Valle Cartel, one of the world's most powerful and dangerous drug-trafficking cartels,"" said Acting U.S. Attorney Lev L. Dassin for the Southern District of New York. ""Montoya Sanchez's arrest and extradition marked the end of his long campaign of violence and corruption. We are grateful to our partners at the DEA and in the Colombian government for their tireless work in this investigation.""

""Montoya Sanchez's path to the top of the Norte Valle Cartel was marked by decades of extreme violence. That path has now ended in a prison cell, where the man who personally helped direct multi-ton shipments of addictive and destructive narcotics into American cities and towns will be held for his crimes,"" said Assistant Attorney General Lanny A. Breuer of the Criminal Division. ""This conviction is a major victory in the joint effort by Colombia and the United States to disrupt and dismantle these drug trafficking organizations, made possible through extensive cooperation with our partners in the Southern District of Florida, the Southern District of New York, the DEA and the FBI.""

""This notorious leader of the extremely violent Norte Valle Cartel is where he belongs: behind bars for murder, drug trafficking and racketeering,"" said Acting DEA Administrator Michele M. Leonhart. ""Due to the skilled and brave work by the men and women of DEA and the Colombian National Police, justice has been served for the many victims of his cartel's extreme violence and the tons of cocaine that ended up on American streets. Now he is in prison, no longer able to use his power to destroy others or benefit from his ill-gotten gains.""

Montoya Sanchez is the fourth member of his family to be convicted as part of the case out of the Southern District of Florida. In January 2009, Montoya Sanchez's brother, Eugenio Montoya Sanchez, pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to import more than five kilograms of cocaine into the United States and one count of obstruction of justice by murder and was subsequently sentenced to 30 years in prison. In November 2005, Montoya Sanchez's brother, Juan Carlos Montoya Sanchez, and his cousin, Carlos Felipe Toro Sanchez, both pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to import more than five kilograms of cocaine into the United States. They were sentenced to terms of 262 and 235 months in prison, respectively.

According to in-court statements during the hearing, Diego Montoya Sanchez agreed to serve a 45-year prison term for the crimes outlined in the court documents. Sentencing has been scheduled for Oct. 21, 2009, at 8:30 a.m. before Judge Altonaga.

The Southern District of Florida indictment is being prosecuted by the U.S. Attorney's Office and was investigated by the FBI. The SDNY/NDDS indictment was the result of a multi-district investigation and is being prosecuted jointly by SDNY and NDDS, and was investigated by the DEA. The Criminal Division's Office of International Affairs and NDDS Judicial Attachés in Bogota, Colombia provided significant assistance in both cases. U.S. law enforcement received invaluable assistance in its prosecution of Diego Montoya Sanchez from the Government of Colombia, the Colombian National Police and the Colombian Army.",pleaded guilty

Millionaire Anglo-American software pioneer John David McAfee has been arrested and charged with failing to pay taxes for a period of four years.

An indictment was unsealed yesterday by the United States Department of Justice that charges the 75-year-old with tax evasion and willful failure to file tax returns.

According to the indictment, the Roanoke College graduate earned millions in income from promoting cryptocurrencies, consulting work, speaking engagements, and selling the rights to his life story to documentary-makers.

But the DOJ alleges that McAfee allegedly failed to file tax returns from 2014 to 2018, ""despite receiving considerable income from these sources.""

It is alleged that the man who founded multiple companies, including Tribal Voice, QuorumEx, and Future Tense, evaded his tax liability by directing his income to be paid into bank accounts and cryptocurrency exchange accounts in the names of nominees.

The indictment further alleges McAfee attempted to evade America's Internal Revenue Service by placing assets he owned in the names of other people. Among the assets he is accused of concealing are real estate property, a vehicle, and a yacht.

The indictment was unsealed after the British-born resident of Lexington, Tennessee, was arrested in Spain, where he is currently awaiting extradition.

The charges were announced shortly after the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) revealed that it had brought civil charges against McAfee.

The government regulator alleges that between 2017 and 2018, McAfee leveraged his fame to recommend seven cryptocurrency offerings that turned out to be ""essentially worthless."" However, McAfee allegedly neglected to disclose that he had been paid over $23m to do so.

In 2019, McAfee tweeted that he hadn't filed tax returns for 8 years because ""taxation is illegal."" If convicted in both cases, the entrepreneur could be imprisoned for a maximum of 35 years.

Charges have also been brought by the SEC against McAfee's bodyguard, Jimmy Watson, who allegedly aided and abetted the sale of digital currencies.

McAfee founded the software company McAfee Associates in 1987 and ran it until 1994, when he resigned from the company.

The indictment does not allege that McAfee received any income or had any connection with the anti-virus company bearing his name during the period when he allegedly failed to pay taxes.",

Former Maldives President Abdulla Yameen has been sentenced to five years in prison for money laundering.

The charges focused on a payment of $1m (£770,000) by a private company that was supposed to go to the state.

Prosecutors said the money, fees for leasing land for tourism development, went instead to Yameen's bank account. He denied the accusations.

The controversial former president served for five years until his surprise defeat in the 2018 election.

Widely seen as pro-China and accused of crushing dissent in the archipelago, Yameen was also ordered by the court in the capital, Male, to pay a fine of $5m. He is expected to appeal.

Judge Ali Rasheed, who headed a panel of five judges trying the case, said it had been established beyond any reasonable doubt that Yameen had taken money that he knew was embezzled from the state.

Dozens of the former president's supporters gathered outside the court, saying his was innocent.

The Maldives is a key battleground in the rivalry between China and India. Famous for its 26 coral atolls and 1,192 islands, it is home to more than 400,000 people.

Tourism is a vital part of its economy but there are fears for the archipelago's future because of climate change.",money laundering

Chelsea football club owner Roman Abramovich has been forced to deny an explosive allegation that he was known for “suspicion of money laundering and presumed contacts with criminal organisations”.

The billionaire Russian, who was unable to obtain a UK visa, lost a seven-month battle against a Swiss newspaper publisher to stop the allegations, reportedly made by Switzerland’s federal police, from being published.

Claims made in Swiss publication 24heures say the country’s Federal Office of Police (Fedpol) made a report to the country’s immigration service, which raised concerns about Abramovich after he applied to become a resident.

Abramovich applied for a Swiss residency to live at a ski resort in the south-western province of Canton in July 2016, personally contacting the head of federal police to insist his permit be granted, 24heures reported.

The newspaper said Abramovich’s application was initially accepted, with a local residency bureaucrat describing him as a “very attractive taxpayer”.

After authorities passed the application on to Fedpol, investigators sounded the alarm, producing a report in January 2017 which alleged Abramovich would pose “threat to public security and a reputational risk”, adding “the applicant’s assets are at least partially of illegal origin”, according to Tamedia, the media company which owns 24heures.

Abramovich became aware of objections last year, and in November 2017 wrote a letter of complaint to Fedpol director Nicoletta della Valle. Fedpol rejected his complaint, saying they stood by their decision.

Journalists obtained Fedpol’s assessment, but were banned from publishing it after Abramovich obtained a court order, which was overturned last week.

Abramovich’s lawyer, Daniel Glasl, has requested the Swiss police make a correction of facts, saying in a statement: “We are extremely disappointed by the release and publication of confidential information from Swiss government files regarding Mr Abramovich, which occurred in clear violation of Swiss criminal law and Swiss data protection laws.

“We have filed a request for correction of facts to the Swiss Federal Police and will be filing a criminal complaint against unknown persons responsible for dissemination of this confidential information.

“Any suggestion that Mr Abramovich has been involved in money laundering or has contacts with criminal organisations is entirely false.”

A Fedpol spokesperson told City A.M.: “Based on informations from various sources, Fedpol assesses whether a residence permit endangers Switzerland's internal or external security.

The decision on the granting of a residence permit is the responsibility of [SEM, the Swiss migration authority]. There are several cases in which the SEM has refused to issue a residence permit after evaluating the safety assessment of Fedpol.”

Possessing a $14.7bn (£11.17bn) fortune derived from metals and oil according to Bloomberg, Abramovich became one of Russia’s best-known UK-based oligarchs following his £140m takeover of Chelsea football club in 2003. He owns the world’s largest fleet of luxury yachts.

He holds a £1.22bn stake in the club, which remains one of his biggest UK assets alongside a £2.2bn stake in steel-maker Evraz and his £152m Kensington mansion.

Earlier this year, it was reported that Abramovich had been experiencing visa problems in the UK, after new regulations meant he was not offered investor residency status, and the oligarch withdrew his residency application in spring, later obtaining Israeli citizenship. Last month, the Sunday Times reported that he had hired an investment bank to consider the sale of his stake in Chelsea, having turned down an offer from entrepreneur Sir Jim Ratcliffe.",money laundering

The All Progressives Congress (APC) has made a list of several corruption allegations it says will frustrate Senate President Bukola Sarakis presidential ambition in 2019.

According to Vanguard, the ruling party said that the Senate President will not pass the integrity and anti-corruption test.

This was made known to newsmen by the APC spokesman, Yekini Nabena, in a statement which he issued on Monday, August 20, 2018, according to Daily Post.

Saraki, in an interview with Bloomberg on Tuesday, August 15, 2018, said that he's considering the possibility of running for the office of president against President Buhari in the 2019 presidential election.

See the 7 corruption allegations reproduced below:

1. N1b allegedly looted from Société Générale Bank

“In a recent interview with the international news organization, Bloomberg, the Senate President, Dr. Bukola Saraki unsurprisingly declared his intention to contest the 2019 Presidency under the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).

“Against the backdrop of the litany of corruption allegations trailing the Senate President, Saraki’s declaration, brings to the fore our earlier call to anti-graft agencies to check the use of stolen public funds to finance elections in this country. We reiterate our position that the Nigerian electorate must have the opportunity to choose from candidates that can pass the integrity and anti-corruption test.

“Let us refresh our memory on some of Saraki’s corruption allegations: Allegations of fraud which led to the collapse of the Saraki family-owned Société Générale Bank (Bukola Saraki who was Director of the defunct bank was indicted over N1bn alleged to have been looted from the bank’s treasury).”

2. Mis-appropriation of Kwara State funds

“Misappropriation of Kwara State funds, disregard of government due process and conversion of State government assets into his and cronies when he served as two-term governor of Kwara State.

“History of betrayals, treachery and sabotage – Family, political party (PDP, APC), Senate, government.”

3. N11b financial scandal at the defunct Intercontinental Bank

The APC spokesman said “Saraki was questioned by the Nigeria Police Special Fraud Unit over an N11 billion financial scandal at the defunct Intercontinental Bank.”

4. Hidden Panama funds.

According to Nabena, the Senate President's desire to acquire for property is 'Gluttonous '.

“Gluttonous property acquisitions and hidden multi-billion dollar assets spread across the world as disclosed by the Panama Papers revelations.”

5. Shonga Agricultural Project.

Nabena also mentioned a “multi-million dollar white elephant Shonga Agricultural Project in Kwara State when Saraki served as two-term governor.”

6. Falsification of Senate Order

The APC spokesman accused Saraki of “Falsification of Senate standing order""

""Saraki’s link to the N298m armoured Range Rover SUV seized by the Nigeria Customs Service.”

7. $19.5b Paris Club Loan refund scandal

“Saraki is link to $19.5b Paris Club Loan refund scandal, he oversaw budget padding in the National Assembly among other numerous corruption scandals,” Nabena added.

APC warns Nigerians

The party also warned Nigerians to be wary of Saraki, who it says will always put himself over National interest.

“Nigerians should be wary of a man whose personal ambition will always supersede the interest of the majority and national interest as currently displayed in the National Assembly.

“While Saraki refuses to reconvene the National Assembly, the 2019 election budget of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) is dangerously delayed, an action deliberately taken to sabotage INEC’s ability to conduct free, fair, transparent and credible elections in 2019.

“While Saraki refuses to step down as Senate President as rightly and severally demanded by the APC-dominated Senate, he is bent on foisting a PDP-minority rule (Senate President and Deputy Senate President) in the Upper Legislative House,” the statement added.

Saraki's way

Nabena, in the statement, also said Saraki only knows how to play politics that will benefit him alone.

He said “The only politics that Bukola Saraki plays is self, himself only and only himself. The interest and welfare of the people of Nigeria do not mean anything to him. Now it is the Presidency Saraki wants.

“And we ask with what antecedents is he doing this? Conspiracy, blackmail, treachery and vaulting ambition which overleaps itself and falls on the other, as rightly captured by William Shakespeare. Bukola Saraki will rather rule in hell than serve in paradise.

“Ahead of 2019 elections, Nigerians must ensure that we never again entrust the leadership of this great country to thieves whose sole aim is treasury looting and returning us to the dark ages where impunity and institutionalized corruption was the order of the day.”

Meanwhile, the All Progressives Congress (APC) National Leader, Bola Tinubu hassaid that Saraki and the Sokoto State Governor, Aminu Waziri Tambuwal left the APC because the party could not offer them what they wanted.

Tinubu said those who defected wanted automatic tickets and also to share Nigeria’s money, which the ruling party could not guarantee.",corruption

June 21, 2006.--Message and accompanying papers referred to the Committee on International Relations and ordered to be printed To the Congress of the United States: Consistent with subsection 204(b) of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1703(b) (IEEPA), and section 301 of the National Emergencies Act, 50 U.S.C. 1631 (NEA), I hereby report that I have issued an Executive Order (the ``order'') blocking the property of persons in connection with the situation in Belarus. In that order, I declared a national emergency with respect to the policies and actions of certain individuals in Belarus, to address the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States posed by the actions and circumstances involving Belarus, as described below. This action follows the issuance of Proclamation 8015 of May 12, 2006, ``Suspension of Entry as Immigrants and Nonimmigrants of Persons Responsible for Policies or Actions That Threaten the Transition to Democracy in Belarus,'' in which I determined that it is in the interest of the United States to suspend the entry into the United States of members of the government of Alyaksandr Lukashenka and others who formulate, implement, participate in, or benefit from policies or actions, including electoral fraud, human rights abuses, and corruption, that undermine or injure democratic institutions or impede the transition to democracy in Belarus. The United States, the European Union, and other allies and partners around the world have repeatedly expressed support for the democratic aspirations of the Belarusian people and condemned the Belarusian government's human rights abuses, assaults on democracy, and corruption. The Belarusian authorities have resorted to intense repression in an attempt to preserve their power, including the disappearances of four regime critics in 1999 and 2000, which the authorities have failed to investigate seriously despite credible information linking top government officials to these acts. The undemocratic 2006 presidential election was only the latest example of the Belarusian government's disregard for the rights of its own citizens. Hundreds of civic and opposition activists were arrested--and many beaten--both before and after the vote for exercising their rights. The authorities forcibly dispersed peaceful post-election demonstrations. There is simply no place in a Europe whole and free for a regime of this kind. The order also takes an important step in the fight against public corruption, which threatens important United States interests globally, including ensuring security and stability, the rule of law and core democratic values, advancing prosperity, and creating a level playing field for lawful business activities. As noted in Proclamation 8015, the persistent acts of corruption by Belarusian government officials in the performance of public functions has played a significant role in frustrating the Belarusian people's aspirations for democracy. This order authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to block the assets of senior-level officials of the Government of Belarus, their family members, or those closely linked to such officials engaged in such corruption. Thus, pursuant to IEEPA and the NEA, I have determined that these actions and circumstances constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States, and I have issued the order to deal with this threat. The order blocks the property and interests in property in the United States, or in the possession or control of United States persons, of the persons listed in the Annex to the order, as well as of any person determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, after consultation with the Secretary of State: --to be responsible for, or to have participated in, actions or policies that undermine democratic processes or institutions in Belarus; --to be responsible for, or to have participated in, human rights abuses related to political repression in Belarus; --to be a senior-level official, a family member of such official, or a person closely linked to such an official who is responsible for or has engaged in public corruption related to Belarus. The order also authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury, after consultation with the Secretary of State, to designate for such blocking any person determined to have materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services in support of, the activities listed above or any person listed in or designated pursuant to the order. I further authorized the Secretary of the Treasury, after consultation with the Secretary of State, to designate for such blocking any person determined to be owned or controlled by, or acting or purporting to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, any person listed in or designated pursuant to the order. The Secretary of the Treasury, after consultation with the Secretary of State, is also authorized to remove any persons from the Annex to the order as circumstances warrant. I delegated to the Secretary of the Treasury, after consultation with the Secretary of State, the authority to take such actions, including the promulgation of rules and regulations, and to employ all powers granted to the President by IEEPA, as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of the order. All executive agencies are directed to take all appropriate measures within their authority to carry out the provisions of the order. The order, a copy of which is enclosed, was effective at 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on June 19, 2006. George W. Bush. The White House, June 19, 2006.

(IEEPA), the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) (NEA), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of America, determine that the actions and policies of certain members of the Government of Belarus and other persons to undermine Belarus's democratic processes or institutions, manifested most recently in the fundamentally undemocratic March 2006 elections, to commit human rights abuses related to political repression, including detentions and disappearances, and to engage in public corruption, including by diverting or misusing Belarusian public assets or by misusing public authority, constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States, hereby declare a national emergency to deal with that threat, and hereby order: Section 1. (a) Except to the extent provided in section 203(b)(1), (3), and (4) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1702(b)(1), (3), and (4)), or in regulations, orders, directives, or licenses that may be issued pursuant to this order, and notwithstanding any contract entered into or any license or permit granted prior to the effective date of this order, all property and interests in property that are in the United States, that hereafter come within the United States, or that are or hereafter come within the possession or control of any United States person, including any overseas branch, of the following persons are blocked and may not be transferred, paid, exported, withdrawn, or otherwise dealt in: (i) the persons listed in the Annex to this order; and (ii) any person determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, after consultation with the Secretary of State: (A) to be responsible for, or to have participated in, actions or policies that undermine democratic processes or institutions in Belarus; (B) to be responsible for, or to have participated in, human rights abuses related to political repression in Belarus; (C) to be a senior-level official, a family member of such an official, or a person closely linked to such an official who is responsible for or has engaged in public corruption related to Belarus; (D) to have materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services in support of, the activities described in paragraphs (a)(ii)(A) through (C) of this section or any person listed in or designated pursuant to this order; or (E) to be owned or controlled by, or acting or purporting to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, any person listed in or designated pursuant to this order. (b) I hereby determine that the making of donations of the type of articles specified in section 203(b)(2) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1702(b) (2)) by, to, or for the benefit of any person listed in or designated pursuant to this order would seriouslyimpair my ability to deal with the national emergency declared in this order, and I hereby prohibit such donations as provided by paragraph (a) of this section. (c) The prohibitions in paragraph (a) of this section include, but are not limited to, (i) the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of any person listed in or designated pursuant to this order, and (ii) the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services from any such person. Sec. 2. (a) Any transaction by a United States person or within the United States that evades or avoids, has the purpose of evading or avoiding, or attempts to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited. (b) Any conspiracy formed to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited. Sec. 3. For purposes of this order: (a) the term ``person'' means an individual or entity; (b) the term ``entity'' means a partnership, association, trust, joint venture, corporation, group, subgroup, or other organization; (c) the term ``United States person'' means any United States citizen, permanent resident alien, entity organized under the laws of the United States or any jurisdiction within the United States (including foreign branches), or any person in the United States. Sec. 4. For those persons listed in or designated pursuant to this order who might have a constitutional presence in the United States, I find that because of the ability to transfer funds or other assets instantaneously, prior notice to such persons of measures to be taken pursuant to this order would render these measures ineffectual. I therefore determine that for these measures to be effective in addressing the national emergency declared in this order, there need be no prior notice of a listing or determination made pursuant to section 1 of this order. Sec. 5. The Secretary of the Treasury, after consultation with the Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to take such actions, including the promulgation of rules and regulations, and to employ all powers granted to the President by IEEPA, as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this order. The Secretary of the Treasury may redelegate any of these functions to other officers and agencies of the United States Government, consistent with applicable law. All executive agencies of the United States Government are hereby directed to take all appropriate measures within their authority to carry out the provisions of this order and, where appropriate, to advise the Secretary of the Treasury in a timely manner of the measures taken. The Secretary of the Treasury shall ensure compliance with those provisions of section 401 of the NEA (50 U.S.C. 1641) applicable to the Department of the Treasury in relation to this order. Sec. 6. The Secretary of the Treasury, after consultation with the Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to submit the recurring and final reports to the Congress on the national emergency declared in this order, consistent with section 401(c) of the NEA (50 U.S.C. 1641(c)) and section 204(c) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1703 (c)). Sec. 7. The Secretary of the Treasury, after consultation with the Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to determine, subsequent to the issuance of this order, that circumstances no longer warrant the inclusion of a person in the Annex to this order and that the property and interests in property of that person are therefore no longer blocked pursuant to section 1 of this order. Sec. 8. This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right, benefit, or privilege, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, instrumentalities, or entities, its officers or employees, or any other person.

LAS VEGAS, Nev. – A federal jury in Las Vegas, Nevada, yesterday convicted Craig P. Orrock, a former attorney and former Internal Revenue Service (IRS) employee, of tax evasion and obstructing the internal revenue laws, announced Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Richard E. Zuckerman of the Justice Department’s Tax Division, U.S. Attorney Nicholas A. Trutanich for the District of Nevada, and Special Agent in Charge Tara Sullivan of IRS-Criminal Investigation.

According to court documents and evidence presented at trial, starting in the early 1990s, Orrock, currently of Sandy, Utah, evaded the payment of his federal income taxes and obstructed IRS efforts to collect those taxes. Orrock filed federal individual income tax returns for the years 1993 through 2015, but failed to pay the income taxes reported as due. He attempted to prevent the IRS from collecting the reported income taxes through the use of nominee entities, bank accounts and trusts to hide his income and assets from IRS collection officers. Orrock attempted to evade the assessment of a large part of the income tax he owed for 2007, by concealing from the IRS both the ownership of real estate he held through a nominee known as Arville Properties LLC as well as the proceeds from the sale of the property.

From 1993 through 2015, Orrock evaded the payment of over $500,000 in federal income taxes.

Orrock faces up to five years in prison on each of the first two counts and up to three years in prison on the third count, as well as a period of supervised release, restitution and monetary penalties. Sentencing is scheduled for Aug. 26.

Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Zuckerman and U.S. Attorney Trutanich commended special agents of IRS-Criminal Investigation, who conducted the investigation, and Assistant U.S. Attorney Patrick Burns and Tax Division Trial Attorney Erin S.

A US lawyer has been found guilty for his role in the OneCoin cryptocurrency scam, which raised billions of pounds from investors convinced they were buying into a new digital currency.

A New York jury found that Mark Scott helped to perpetrate the scheme, routing approximately $400m (£310m) out of the US while working to conceal the true ownership and source of the funds.

Prosecutors said he made about $50m.

Mr Scott's lawyers had said he did not know that OneCoin was worthless.

They said he was simply doing the job asked by Dr Ruja Ignatova, a co-founder of the Bulgaria-based OneCoin.

The federal jury in Manhattan rejected those arguments, finding Mr Scott guilty of conspiracy to commit money laundering and bank fraud.

Dr Ignatova's brother, who testified in the case, also recently pleaded guilty for his role in the fraud.

US-based investors claiming to have been defrauded by the scheme are also attempting to sue Mr Scott for recompense in a related case.

In total, investigators believe as much as £4bn was raised globally via what is said to have amounted to a Ponzi scheme, with investors based in Uganda, China and the UK among other countries.

""OneCoin used the success story of Bitcoin to induce victims to invest under the guise that they, too, could get rich through their investments,"" New York state attorneys said in one filing.

""This was, of course, completely false because the price of OneCoin was a fiction and not based on supply and demand.""

Dr Ignatova, an ex-McKinsey consultant, disappeared from view around October 2017. There has not been a confirmed sighting since.

However, the Bulgaria-based organisation behind OneCoin Ltd continues to operate and denies all wrongdoing.

""OneCoin verifiably fulfils all criteria of the definition of a cryptocurrency,"" it said in a recent statement given to The Missing Cryptoqueen, a BBC podcast.

Indian drinks tycoon Vijay Mallya, who is charged with committing fraud in India, has been re-arrested in London.

He appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Tuesday afternoon, after India issued new charges of money-laundering against him.

Mr Mallya denies any wrongdoing. The allegations are linked to the collapse of his airline, Kingfisher.

The 61-year-old left India in March 2016 more than $1bn (£755m) in debt, after defaulting on bank loan payments.

He was released on police bail after the hearing.

Mr Mallya's monetary affairs are being investigated by India's Central Bureau of Investigation, and the Enforcement Directorate - which handles financial crimes.

He was originally arrested and bailed in April after India asked for his extradition in February.

France has granted political asylum to Kazakhstan's exiled opposition leader Mukhtar Ablyazov, according to his lawyer and a French newspaper.
The French daily Le Monde reported on October 5 that France’s National Court of Asylum Issues, the CDNA, had granted asylum to the fugitive former banker.
In its ruling, dated September 29, the court deplored direct pressure from Kazakhstan and ""the obvious attempts by outside agents to exert influence on the asylum authorities,"" according to the report.
Le Monde said the court had reviewed for several months Ablyazov's appeal against an earlier decision by the French Office for the Protection of Refugees and Stateless Persons to reject Ablyazov’s asylum request.
His lawyer, Bota Jardemalie, wrote on Facebook on October 4 that the CDNA’s decision was made ""despite the most massive political pressure by Kazakhstan on the leadership of France, international lobbying organized by [Kazakhstan's] regime, its dirty PR, fabricated accusations, manipulations and direct pressure on the French justice [system].""
Ablyazov has been a vocal critic of Kazakh President Qasym-Zhomart Toqaev and his predecessor, Nursultan Nazarbaev.
In recent years, he has been organizing and coordinating the activities of his Democratic Choice of Kazakhstan movement and protest rallies in Kazakhstan's capital, Nur-Sultan, and other towns and cities via the Internet.

BOSTON (Reuters) - The founder of drugmaker Insys Therapeutics Inc and four colleagues were found guilty on Thursday of bribing doctors to prescribe an addictive painkiller, helping to drive the U.S. opioid drug abuse crisis.

A federal jury in Boston found John Kapoor, who served as the drugmaker's chairman, and his co-defendants guilty of racketeering conspiracy for a scheme that also misled insurers into paying for the drug.

Kapoor, 75, is the highest-ranking pharmaceutical executive convicted in a case tied to a drug crisis that has led to tens of thousands of overdose deaths annually. His 2017 arrest came the same day U.S. President Donald Trump declared the epidemic a public health emergency.

Prosecutors charged that Kapoor oversaw a wide-ranging scheme to bribe doctors nationwide by retaining them to act as speakers at sham events at restaurants ostensibly meant to educate clinicians about its fentanyl spray, Subsys.

""Dr. Kapoor is disappointed in the verdict, as are we,"" Beth Wilkinson, one of Kapoor's defense attorneys said in an emailed statement. ""Four weeks of jury deliberations confirm that this was far from an open-and-shut case.""

Michael Babich, who resigned as Insys' chief executive in 2015, pleaded guilty to his role in the scheme in January and became a key witness for prosecutors.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Subsys in 2012 only for use in treating severe cancer pain. Yet prosecutors claimed doctors who took bribes often prescribed Subsys to patients without cancer, helping boost sales for Chandler, Arizona-based Insys.

Prosecutors said Kapoor also directed efforts to defraud insurers into paying for the drug. His co-defendants include former Insys executives and managers Michael Gurry, Richard Simon, Sunrise Lee and Joseph Rowan.

The charges carry a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.

Lawyers for Kapoor at trial acknowledged that Insys paid doctors but contend that he believed they really were being paid to talk up the product's benefits.

The jury heard evidence early in the trial about Lee, an ex-stripper turned Insys regional sales director, who gave a lap dance to a doctor at a Chicago club as part of an effort to push him to prescribe the drug.

After the verdict was read, Assistant U.S. Attorney Fred Wyshak asked U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs to confine Kapoor to his home until he is sentenced, saying his wealth made him a flight risk. Burroughs denied that request.

The heir to the Nina Ricci perfume and fashion fortune has been convicted of tax fraud by a Paris court after hiding millions in an offshore HSBC account.

Arlette Ricci, 73, was sentenced to a year in prison and ordered to pay a €1 million (£720,000;$1.1m) fine.

The court also confiscated two properties worth four million euros (£2.9m;$4.2m).

HSBC's Swiss private banking arm is being investigated after a leak revealed large scale tax fraud.

Ms Ricci, who can appeal, was given a two-year suspended sentence on top of her one-year custodial sentence.

Her daughter, Margot Vignat, 51, was also convicted and given an eight-month suspended sentence.

Ms Ricci was accused of hiding millions of euros from the French authorities to evade tax using an offshore HSBC account.

She was ordered by the court to pay millions in back taxes for the period of 2007-2009, with the exact amount to be set at a later date.

Ms Ricci's lawyer, Jean-Marc Fedida, claimed his client had been made an example of, calling her sentence ""extremely severe"".

Mr Fedida said he may ask the judge to let Ms Ricci serve the sentence under lenient conditions, such as partial liberty or wearing an electronic tag.

But telephone recordings quoted in court apparently showed that the perfume heiress was aware she was breaking the law.

In one phone conversation, she said, laughing, ""I believe I did the right thing and I never heard from Bercy so all is well,"" referring to the French finance ministry.

""Yes, inevitably, necessarily because all that is illegal anyway,"" she said.

'Unacceptable' practices

Ms Ricci, who has consistently denied the accusations against her, will now have to decide whether to appeal against her conviction.

She was the first of around 50 French nationals to face trial over tax evasion in the HSBC case. Her prosecution was seen as a test case for the so-called ""Swissleaks"" scandal.

A list of thousands of HSBC's clients was passed to the French government in 2009 by whistleblower Herve Falciani, a former employee of the bank's private operation in Switzerland.

But the bank's tax-evasion practices didn't come to light until the documents were reported by the BBC's Panorama programme and a host of other international media outlets in 2015.

Widespread media coverage led to criminal investigations in the US, France, Belgium and Argentina but not in the UK, where HSBC is based.

The UK's HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) was given the leaked data in 2010 and identified 1,100 people from the list of 7,000 British clients who had not paid their taxes. But almost five years later, only one tax evader has been prosecuted.",convicted of tax fraud

The Honduras government, working closely with US authorities, has cracked down on one of Honduras’ largest drug transport organizations, the Cachiros, seizing properties and businesses and in the process painting a picture of a group whose reach may extend to Honduras’ political and possibly its financial elite.

Honduras police and military have identified 61 properties, 4 commercial establishments, and 24 vehicles in two provinces for seizure, as well as 64 dollar and lempira bank accounts to be frozen at the US Treasury Department’s behest, La Prensa reported.

The US Treasury estimated the value of the assets at $500 million, the newspaper said.

In a statement, the Treasury said the Cachiros is headed by Javier and Leonel Rivera Maradiaga, and its members include their father, Santos Isidro Rivera Cardona, mother, Esperanza Caridad Maradiaga Lopez, sister, Maira Lizeth Rivera Maradiaga, and brother, Santos Isidro Rivera Maradiaga. They do not face charges in Honduras and no formal indictment has been released in the United States.

As opposed to its July 1 statement, in which it named the group as “specially designated narcotics traffickers” without providing details, the Treasury this time identified several companies the group controls, among them a mining operation, a cattle ranch, an African Palm oil processor and a zoo.

An anonymous Treasury source told El Heraldo that there were “dozens” of companies and proxies laundering money for the organization.

The money comes from the group’s lucrative drug trafficking business, which the Treasury detailed in its statement.

“Los Cachiros coordinates the movement of drugs to and from Honduras for Colombian and Mexican drug trafficking organizations, including the Sinaloa Cartel,” the Treasury said. “Los Cachiros employs land, air, and sea conveyances in its movement of drugs, and its activities have been linked to seizures of cocaine in Central America. It is reported that Los Cachiros controls 90 percent of the clandestine airstrips in Honduras, and it uses these airstrips to facilitate the entry of drugs into Honduras and Guatemala.”

InSight Crime Analysis

If you look at the organizational chart provided by the Treasury (see below, or for complete version see attachment), you might mistake this group for a small, rural band of gangsters. But this organization has deep contacts in the country’s elite that keep their money safe and the judicial authorities at bay. It also has a distribution network that stretches into three countries.

At least part of their reach came to light in a cable released by Wikileaks in which outgoing Ambassador Charles Ford spoke candidly about then President Manuel Zelaya. In the cable, Ford talks of ways in which criminal groups “have pressured [Zelaya] to name one of their own” to a high level post in the Security Ministry.

One of those groups was presumably the Cachiros, who, when their candidate was not selected, took it personally. Senator Juan Ramon Salgado Cuevas was assassinated shortly thereafter, and Honduran intelligence told InSight Crime it was because Salgado had failed to secure the Cachiros’ candidate for the ministry job.

The Treasury also does not mention the family’s possible link to the Tocoa soccer club, Real Sociedad Municipal, whose players wear on their chests the logo of Joya Grande, the zoo in question, and whose ownership has been tied to the Cachiros.
The club counts Banco Continental — a company managed by one of the country’s wealthiest families — as one of its other sponsors.

The support has worked. The club has moved to the first division where it is considered one of the best teams.

The Treasury does make reference to the distribution chain, noting that Nicaraguan authorities arrested Nicaraguan national and alleged Cachiros associate Bismarck Antonio Lira Jiron last August. He remains in custody in Nicaragua, facing charges of drug trafficking with the Cachiros to the north and the Norte del Valle Cartel in Colombia to the south.

However, the Cachiros main contacts are along the Guatemala – Honduras border where they can pass cocaine to their Guatemalan and Mexican counterparts, collecting about $2,000 per kilo. If it is true that they control 90 percent of the air traffic coming through Honduras, then that would make some healthy profits. By InSight Crime’s estimates, the family grosses up to $4 million per month from its trafficking operations, which are concentrated in the Colon province.

The Cachiros are the second large organization from Honduras that the US Treasury has outed in recent months. The other is led by Jose Miguel “Chepe” Handal Perez, a politician and businessman operating from San Pedro Sula, who is at large after the US added him to the same list the Cachiros made in July.

As they did with Handal, Honduran authorities have declared that battle is being waged. The head of the Senate’s banking committee called on banks to stop doing business with money launderers; a frontrunner in November’s presidential elections said all candidates should “abstain from using dirty money.”

But sincerity is in short supply in Honduras. Santos Isidro Rivera was arrested briefly earlier this year on weapons charges but released. Leonel was arrested in 2011, but also released.

The Honduran state has largely collapsed, leaving a rich stew of corruption and drug trafficking, which is now boiling over. Witness the fact that the Cachiros have a road construction business, the perfect way to feed corrupt politicians and launder illicit proceeds at the same time.

Drug traffickers still appear to fear the United States, especially the prospect of extradition, which the Honduras government recently green-lighted. However, only one person, who was not a Honduran, has been extradited since, and while the United States is pressuring the Honduran government to start capturing and extraditing local suspects, the subject appears to be too sensitive, especially with presidential elections coming.

To be sure, the United States, despite providing millions in support for the security and judicial authorities in Honduras, seems to have run out of ways to pressure the Honduran state to reform its own institutions and to take action on its own. And while efforts such as the move to tackle the Cachiros are an important first step, they came at the behest of a powerful outsider, not a reform-minded, courageous Honduran seeking to change the direction of this nation.

A First 1989 commission of inquiry into the illegal sale of trucks and motor vehicles, commissioned by President Robert Mugabe and headed by former Judge President Wilson Sandura, exposes the extent of corruption by government officials.

The report, while in some cases pointing out wrongdoing by senior officials, finds mitigating circumstances that might have been designed to ensure the accused were not brought to justice.

The Chronicle headed by Geoff Nyarota, broke the story in 1988 which became known as the “Willowgate scandal” in which senior officials were accused of using a government facility to purchase vehicles from Willowvale Motor Industries and resell them for profit.

The Sandura commission’s first inquiry rocked the government at the time. The Zimbabwenewslive.com will in the next few weeks make available the details of the report. Our last reported focused on current Speaker of Parliament Jacob Mudenda. This week we look at Oppah Muchinguri Kashiri (born Oppah Chamu Zvipange Muchinguri who is the current Minister of Defence in the Cabinet of Zimbabwe. She has also served as Minister of Higher Education and Minister of Women’s Affairs.

Allegations

The allegation against this Deputy Minister was that in May 1988 she purchased a motor vehicle from Willowvale and resold it shortly thereafter at a price exceeding the controlled price. The moto vehicle in question was a Toyota Cressida Sedan, Registration No.477-519H, 1988 model.

Evidence

The commission heard evidence from the following witnesses:

G. Long, N. Davis, K.Jarvis, J.Magura and O.Muchinguri.

In addition, the Commission received an affidavit from A.Mawere who is presently working in the United States of America.

Muchinguri’s evidence is as follows:-

When she became a Member of Parliament in October 1987 she did not own a motor vehicle. She approached the speaker of the House of Assembly, informed him that she wanted to purchase a motor vehicle and sought his assistance .He referred her to the Secretary for Industry and Technology. She saw him and sometime in December, 1987, she was informed by the Ministry of Industry and Technology that her name had been placed on a list of persons to be allocated new vehicles. In January, 1988 she was appointed a deputy Minister and a C.M.E.D motor vehicle was allocated to her for her use. The need to purchase a motor vehicle, therefore, fell away. However, in May, 1988, she was informed that a new Toyota Cressida motor vehicle had been allocated to her and was ready for collection from Willowvale.

Because she no longer needed the motor vehicle she phoned Willowvale and spoke to a person called Magura. Magura advised he that if she no longer needed the vehicle she could assign it to another person. Accordingly, she contacted her friend, Mawere, who needed a motor vehicle. Mawere went to Willowvale, paid cash for the motor vehicle and collected it. The vehicle was collected in Muchinguri ’s name. She did not know what happened to the motor vehicle thereafter and she received no benefit from the transaction. Contrary to what the Deputy Minister said, Magura denied that he had been contacted by her. He also denied that he had advised her that she could assign the motor vehicle to another person, though he admitted seeing Mawere when he came to Willowvale to pay for the motor vehicle.

In his Affidavit Mawere admits purchasing the motor vehicle from Willowvale but states that shortly thereafter he had to leave for the United States. Before leaving he took the motor vehicle to a company called Executive Cars and sold to that company for about $30 000. He himself had paid $29 908, 80 for it.After the sale, he left the country.

In their evidence, Long and Davies said that they acted as agents for Executive cars and sold the motor vehicle to African Distillers for $95 000. The proprietors of Executive Cars are out of the country at the moment and the commission has not, therefore, been able to question them. In addition, Mawere is in the United States.

In the circumstances, the Commission cannot determine whether or not it was Deputy Minister or Mawere or both who sold the motor vehicle for $95000 and benefited financially. Further, we cannot say whether or not the actual seller of the motor vehicle was Executive Cars. What we can say, however, is that it was improper for the Deputy Minister to assign the motor vehicle to another person other than a Member of Parliament. We feel that as she no longer required the car she should have informed the Speaker of the House of Assembly or Secretary for Industry and Technology who would have reallocated the motor vehicle to another Member of Parliament or to else who might have deserved the allocation.",allegation of corruption

The United States Department of Justice has charged two Chinese nationals with laundering more than $100 million in cryptocurrency by hacking a cryptocurrency exchange. Tian Yinyin and Li Jiadong were charged with conspiracy to launder monetary instruments, operating an unlicensed money transmitting business. As a result, defendants must forfeit any property and funds involved in the scheme.

In 2018, North Korean actors stole approximately $250 million by hacking an online cryptocurrency exchange. The cryptocurrency was “laundered through hundreds of automated cryptocurrency transactions aimed at preventing law enforcement from tracing the funds.” Additionally, the hackers “circumvented multiple virtual currency exchanges’ know-your-customer controls by submitting doctored photographs and falsified identification documentation.” Some of the funds were used for North Korea’s financial industry hacking efforts.

“Today, we are publicly exposing a criminal network’s valuable support to North Korea’s cyber heist program and seizing the fruits of its crimes,” Assistant Attorney General John C. Demers from the Justice Department’s National Security Division said. “This case exemplifies the commitment of the United States government to work with foreign partners and the worldwide financial services industry to disrupt this blended threat.”

Yinyin and Jiadong laundered more than $100 million in cryptocurrency, mostly from exchange hacks, between December 2017 and April 2019. They used independent and linked accounts and they “provided virtual currency transmission services for a fee for customers.” They did business in the United States but were not registered with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN).

“North Korea continues to attack the growing worldwide ecosystem of virtual currency as a means to bypass the sanctions imposed on it by the United States and the United Nations Security Council. IRS-CI is committed to combatting the means and methods used by foreign and domestic adversaries to finance operations and activities that pose a threat to U.S. national security,” Internal Revenue Service-Criminal Investigation (IRS-CI) Chief Don Fort said. “We will continue to push our agency to the forefront of complex cyber investigations and work collaboratively with our law enforcement partners to ensure these nefarious criminals are stopped and that the integrity of the United States financial system is preserved.”

“The FBI will continue to actively work with our domestic and international law enforcement partners to identify and mitigate illicit movement of currency,” Assistant Director Calvin Shivers of the FBI’s Criminal Investigative Division said. “Today’s indictment and sanctions send a strong message that the United States will not relent in holding accountable bad actors attempting to evade sanctions and undermine our financial system.”

There were 113 named virtual currency accounts and addresses used by Yinyin, Jiadong, and the North Korean hackers. The DOJ seeks to recover the remainder of the funds.

The United States Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) has imposed sanctions on the two Chinese nationals and a variety of cryptocurrency addresses involved in the scheme.

“This indictment shows what can be accomplished when international law enforcement agencies work together to uncover complex cross-border crimes,” Acting Executive Associate Director Alysa Erichs of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) said. “HSI is committed to upholding the rule of law and investigating those that would steal cryptocurrency for their illicit purposes.”

“This case shows how important robust partnerships across the U.S. Government are in disrupting criminal actors,” Acting Assistant Director Robert Wells of the FBI’s Counterintelligence Division said.",money laundering

Steve Bannon and three other defendants are accused of defrauding donors in a border wall fundraising campaign, allegedly using hundreds of thousands of dollars donated to an online crowdfunding campaign called We Build the Wall for personal expenses, among other things.

Bannon and another defendant, Brian Kolfage, promised donors that the campaign, which ultimately raised more than $25 million, was ""a volunteer organization"" and that ""100% of the funds raised...will be used in the execution of our mission and purpose,"" according to the indictment unsealed Thursday.

TMML2024033271465,Bukola Saraki,"Alert ID: TMML2024033271465
It is no longer a secret that Senator Bukola Saraki has emerged as a powerful symbol of the rotten sweetness of democratized corruption in Nigeria. As you read this, the thugs in the pocket of Senator Saraki masquerading as Nigerian senators are tightening the rope of strangulation on President Buhari’s lackluster anti-corruption war. They have vowed that Magu’s head must be cut off or everything in Nigeria will be grounded to a halt. This National Assembly under the leadership of Bukola Saraki is the most dangerously corrupt Assembly in Nigerian history.

Consider this scenario: a sick President was recuperating in London; the cabal that caged Mr. President allowed Senator Bukola Saraki to pay him a rare visit (a special privilege you will think); Mr. President comes back and went into a closed door meeting with Saraki and less than 48 hours, the Senate soundly rejected the confirmation of Magu as EFCC chair for the second time (facilitated by Saraki’s thugs and DSS director appointed by Mr. President). Troubling?

On the surface, you will be tempted to believe that our democracy is finally working – checks and balances and independent DSS. Illusions! The reality is that we are witnessing the smooth operation of one of the smartest and “pathologically corrupt” political operatives in modern Nigeria in Bukola Saraki (I have not forgotten the gibberish of “innocent” until proven guilty).

To say that Senator Saraki is the most powerful political operative in the Nigeria is not an overstatement. Even before he rose to power, he was highly connected by virtue of his father Dr. Olusola Saraki – the strong man of Kwara politics. To understand how powerful the Sarakis are, look at the history of their dynasty in Kwara State dating back to the late 1970s. Unlike other dynasties in Nigeria, the reign of the Sarakis has not been challenged for over 35 years.

To demonstrate that he is “untouchable,” Senator Saraki, who is already involved in a series of corruption trials (false declaration of assets, embezzlement of state fund), is not shying away from adding to his collection of corruption-stained-feathers. The newest scandal is the disappearance of about N3.5 billion refund of Paris Club loan. Fingered in this scandal are Aliko Dangote, the Nigeria Governors Forum and the Central Bank of Nigeria. This has once more rekindled the debate about how to tackle democratized corruption in Nigeria.

The primary reason why corruption has thrived in Nigeria is because perpetrators at all levels have been clever enough to ensure that all relevant parties are “settled.” High and Supreme Court judges, law enforcers and political whistleblowers are, most times, silenced by receiving a cut from the loot or forced by unseen hands wielding more power than the government to succumb to intimidation and blackmail. Dasukigate and Diezanigate are two good examples.

To underscore the seriousness of democratized corruption, Godwin Elumelu, who led an investigation into the misappropriation of billions of Naira in the power sector under Obasanjo’s administration, confessed that the “fight against corruption poses grave and unpredictable risks to those who dare to challenge this gargantuan monster.” He added, “the greater part of the Nigerian problem is the ruling elite; selfish, greedy, unpatriotic and often lawless.”

Apparently, Senator Saraki is not only a smooth operator, but so powerful and lawless that it was rumored last week that he threatened to unleash hell on Buhari’s administration if they push him too hard. This threat came after the EFCC had submitted a damning report on Senator Saraki’s involvement in siphoning N3.5 billion from the Paris Club loan refund - a gargantuan scandal.

In a shocking response, Mr. President ordered an additional release of the Paris Club loan refund even in the face of these allegations. This singular act by President Buhari is an indication that he has been caught by the charm of the rotten sweetness of democratized corruption.

Is President Buhari complicit in encouraging the democratization of corruption in Nigerian institutions? Will Buhari sanction the plot by the DSS and the thugs called senators to redeploy Magu? Is he completely caged now? Is it a “major, general mistake” (thanks Sowore) for President Buhari to be romancing corrupt institutions and individuals while pretending to be fighting corruption? I see the ongoing caricature as simply a case of democratization of corruption; a case of the more you look the more you see, literally.

Recently this administration demonstrated what looks like rare courage by going after the untouchables in our judiciary. The question, though, is: was the show of power against the judiciary selective and cosmetic? Is there any real intent to punish corrupt government officials? Or like the administrations before this, is the story of anti-corruption in Nigeria an illusion?

The clampdown, or what the Presidency called a “surgical” operation, on corruption in the Nigerian judiciary, though a welcome development, is not enough. If indeed there is a real attempt to fight institutionalized corruption in Nigeria, why limit the “surgical” operation to the judiciary? What of the Nigeria Police Force and Nigeria Customs Service – the two powerhouses of institutionalized corruption in Nigeria? What of NNPC – the goose that is laying the golden eggs? What of the Nigerian National Assembly - the cog in the wheel?

Gone are the days when corrupt practices led to the demise of the leadership of the Nigerian National Assembly. Where the likes of Okadigbo, Wabara, Evan(s) Enwerem, Etteh and Bankole failed, Bokola Saraki is thriving. You know why? He has simply perfected the act of institutionalized corruption in Nigeria. As a matter of fact, he took on the persona of a mini god, terrifying and controlling the Presidency and the National Assembly.

Senator Bukola Saraki is a smooth political operator that financed the election of President Buhari. He is an APC member on paper, but was elected Senate President by the opposing PDP members after outsmarting his party. Initially haunted by Buhari’s Presidency, Saraki is now being courted by the cabals behind Buhari for fear of giving Atiku or Tinubu an edge in the repositioning for the 2019 presidential election.

The President is currently limiting the anti-corruption “fight” on the tilapias like Dasuki, Badeh, Metu, etc. But until the cabals around him can summon the courage to point a real “surgical” anti-corruption knife on the crocodiles at the National Assembly, Saraki, who has not been convicted of any corrupt act, will go scot-free under the present state of democratized corruption in Nigeria. Forget about the ongoing drama at the CCB meant to deceive the general public.

Senator Bukola Saraki is a friendly, well-spoken, handsome guy and above all, a smooth political operator. There's little question that he is a political hottie now, but whether his charms will stand the test of time remains to be seen.",corruption

The Trump Presidential Inaugural Committee was swimming in cash, and by the time the festivities had ended, it had raised over $107 million—far more than any other presidential inaugural in history. But it also spent extravagantly, and according to documents recently revealed as part of a lawsuit, staffers were worrying about the bad optics of some of their financial decisions even as they moved forward with them—much of it under the watchful eye of Ivanka Trump.

The records made public as part of the lawsuit reveal that there was a real lack of separation between the Trumps as business owners and the Trumps as the incoming first family. Shortly after the 2016 election, as the newly formed committee was scrambling to organize inaugural events, Rick Gates, the committee’s deputy chair, received a quote from the Trump International Hotel in Washington for the cost of using the hotel’s ballroom. The price tag for the luxury DC establishment, housed in the historic Old Post Office building and owned and operated by the family of the president-elect was huge: $3.6 million for eight days of use, or $450,000 per day. Gates emailed Ivanka Trump, who owns a piece of the hotel, to raise his concerns.

Staffers were worrying about the bad optics of some of their financial decisions even as they moved forward with them—much of it under the watchful eye of Ivanka Trump.

“First, the cost itself seems quite high compared to other property buyouts for the week,” Gates wrote. “Second, I am a bit worried about the optics of PIC [Presidential Inaugural Committee] paying Trump Hotel a high fee and the media making a big story out of it.”

A few days later, Ivanka Trump told Gates that she had called the general manager of the property and the hotel came back to the inaugural committee with a new quote—better, but still asking for $175,000 a day. That rate far exceeded the hotel’s own internal pricing guidelines, and it seems likely that Ivanka Trump, as a part-owner, knew that. (For comparison, the new court filing shows that another nonprofit paid just $5,000 to use part of the Trump Hotel ballroom for part of one of the days the Inaugural Committee had rented it, which matched the internal guidelines.)

At this point, Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, an event planner and personal friend of Melania Trump who managed much of the inaugural planning, warned Ivanka Trump and Gates that when all was said and done, there would be scrutiny of their decision here—audits on what locations were used and how much was paid to use them would be made public. “I understand that compared to the original pricing this is great but we should look at the whole context,” Winston Wolkoff wrote, adding that she thought $85,000 a day was the most she considered to be reasonable.

Winston Wolkoff’s concerns were ignored. The Presidential Inaugural Committee ended up paying the Trump Hotel $1 million for four days use of the hotel’s ballroom.

They probably should have heeded Winston Wolkoff’s warnings. The lawsuit bringing these records to light was filed by Karl Racine, the attorney general of Washington, DC, against the Inaugural Committee and the Trump Organization. Racine is arguing that the district has the right to seek the repayment of funds because nonprofits operating in Washington, DC, which the Inaugural Committee did, may not work to create profits for a private organization or individual. According to Racine, the Inaugural Committee “coordinated with the Trump family to grossly overpay for event space in the Trump International Hotel.” The attorney general is asking that the money be returned and given to charities that promote civic engagement. (Racine is also separately involved with one of the emoluments lawsuits against the president regarding the Trump Old Post Office hotel, brought by the District of Columbia and the state of Maryland.)

If the new lawsuit, which was filed this week, goes forward, it could release a further avalanche of details on how the most lavishly funded inaugural celebration frittered away tens of millions of dollars—and more details about how involved the Trump family itself was in the decision-making.

Unsurprisingly, representatives of the inaugural committee issued a statement to the Washington Post insisting that there was no misconduct.

Racine’s lawsuit also highlights how negotiations between the inaugural committee and the hotel happened specifically in the context of profits for the hotel. In early January 2017, when the committee was considering pulling out of at least one event at the hotel, the hotel’s manager emailed Gates highlighting his concerns: “Just heard that the Friday night reception had been canceled. Is it accurate? Tough on us if it is as it was a lot of revenue for 1,250 people,” Mickael Damelincourt wrote. Gates continued the negotiation.

Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, an event planner and personal friend of Melania Trump, warned Ivanka Trump and Rick Gates that when all was said and done, there would be scrutiny of their decision here. Her concerns were ignored.

Racine’s supporting documents also offer a sense of the (sometimes comical) internal decisions being made for the most expensive inaugural celebration ever, which featured sparse crowds and far fewer events than normal. (Lists of tasks for inaugural committee staff are included in the suit because of the explicit references in them to the negotiations over use of the hotel space.) For instance, there are repeated mentions of Trump’s desire to arrive at a celebration on the mall in a military helicopter, flanked by members of the military. This idea was apparently nixed because at the time of the celebrations, Trump was not yet commander in chief. The documents also describe the president-elect’s hopes for military helicopters and tanks to flank the stage at the outdoor celebration. Another note describes how Donald and Ivanka Trump jointly decided that the Beach Boys would not be performing. At one point, a to-do list item includes asking Melania Trump about a family-and-friends tea reception at the White House, followed by a note from an inaugural committee staffer, “There should be NO reception.” Later, a more adamant note appeared: “Confirmed that NO tea will be hosted at WH and must be removed from schedule.”

Still, some of the most damning material revealed here has nothing to do with the Trump family and their over-the-top plans for the celebration. The documents repeatedly mention that inaugural committee staff should consult with Steve Wynn, the billionaire owner of Wynn Resorts who is a longtime GOP donor and personal friend of Donald Trump. The suggestions are highly specific—Wynn directing that the song “40 Hours a Week” by the band Alabama be played at an inaugural event. In 2018, Wynn was accused of sexual misconduct, which led him to step down as CEO of his casino company and as a finance chair for the Republican National Committee.",corruption

A South Florida man has been charged with bilking the Medicare system and also using his pharmacy to obtain federal loans for small businesses hurt by the coronavirus pandemic, authorities said.

Carlos Belone, 37, of Coconut Creek was arrested Friday and had his first appearance in Fort Lauderdale federal court on charges of wire and healthcare fraud along with making false statements to a financial institution. Belone is expected to be granted a $150,000 bond and will be arraigned on July 24. Neither he nor his federal public defender could be reached for comment.

Belone, the owner of R&S Pharmacy in Coral Springs, is accused of submitting $5.6 million in claims to Medicare, the federal health insurance program, for orthotic braces that were medically unnecessary or not provided, according to a criminal complaint. Investigators interviewed patients who said they did not need the orthotic braces or authorize their Medicare numbers to be used for the pharmacy’s claims, the complaint says.

In addition, Belone is accused of using his pharmacy to submit falsified loan applications through the Small Business Administration’s Payroll Protection Program.

The program offered a total of $650 billion in SBA loans approved by Congress as part of the CARES Act after the COVID-19 pandemic struck the nation in March. The two-year loans are forgiven as long as small businesses mainly use them for covering payroll expenses as well as operational costs such as rent and utilities.

According to the complaint, Belone submitted fake tax documents and fabricated profit and loss statements for his pharmacy to obtain more than $22,000 in PPP loans. Prosecutors say he used the money to further his Medicare scheme and diverted $12,000 to a personal bank account.

The fraud case was investigated by the FBI and Health and Human Services Office of the Inspector General.

The trial of the prominent republican Thomas 'Slab' Murphy at Dublin Special Criminal Court has heard that he had access to considerable cash sums despite not supplying tax returns.

The 66-year-old, from Hackballscross in County Louth, denies failing to furnish tax returns between 1996 and 2004.

The charges arise out of a probe by the Irish police's Criminal Assets Bureau.

The trial is taking place before three judges in a non-jury court and is expected to last three weeks.

Counsel for the state has said that despite Mr Murphy applying for and receiving government grants of more than 100,000 euros (£73,600) he did not make any returns to revenue commissioners.

He said he will show that Mr Murphy had access to considerable cash, more than 300,000 euros (£220,000), for renting land for silage purposes and for dealing with cattle marts.

Grainne Dalton, a retired official from the Irish Department of Agriculture, conceded under cross-examination that she had not personally seen Mr Murphy or any other grant applicant receive or complete forms.

Mr Murphy's lawyer said his client did not accept that he had played any role in submitting grant applications and denied the signatures on the forms were his hand writing.

PALO ALTO (CNN) — Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes has been indicted on federal wire fraud charges, the office of the United States Attorney for the Northern District of California announced Friday.

Holmes and former Theranos COO and president Ramesh “Sunny” Balwani allegedly engaged in a multimillion-dollar scheme to defraud investors, as well as a scheme to defraud doctors and patients, according to a release from the US Attorney’s office.

Holmes and Balwani are charged with two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and nine counts of wire fraud. The indictments happened Thursday and were unsealed on Friday. If convicted, they each face a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison and a fine of $250,000, plus restitution for each count of wire fraud and each conspiracy count, according to the US Attorney’s office.

Minutes before the charges were made public, Theranos announced that Holmes has stepped down as CEO. The company’s general counsel, David Taylor, will take over as CEO. Holmes will stay on as chair of the company’s board.

The company was once valued at as much as $9 billion.

Holmes dropped out of Stanford University to launch Theranos in 2003 with a plan to offer cheaper, more efficient alternative to traditional medical tests. It promised patients the ability to test for conditions like cancer and diabetes with just a few drops of blood.

Holmes was once lauded as the youngest self-made female billionaire. But her net worth was revised down to nothing after Wall Street Journal investigative reporter John Carreyrou started digging into the technology behind her blood testing startup.

In March, the SEC announced “massive fraud” charges of $700 million against Theranos, Holmes and Balwani. The SEC said Theranos, Holmes and Balwani misled partners and investors about the company’s technology, misrepresented revenue projections and falsely claimed it didn’t need regulatory approval for its testing technology.

Holmes and Theranos reached a settlement with the SEC, while the SEC said it would take its case against Balwani to court.

Jeffrey B. Coopersmith, a partner at Davis Wright Tremaine who represents Balwani, called the SEC action against his client “unwarranted.”

“Sunny Balwani accurately represented Theranos to investors to the best of his ability,” Coopersmith said in a statement.

Investors in Theranos included Oracle founder Larry Ellison, venture capital firm Draper Fisher Jurvetson, now Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos and media mogul Rupert Murdoch.",charged

It took three years but a leading federal bank regulator has finally gotten tough with probably the most lawless large financial institution in the country.

The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, an arm of the Treasury Department, recently took action against the former chief executive of Wells Fargo in connection with the scandal in which the bank pressured employees to create bogus accounts that extracted millions of dollars in fees from unsuspecting customers.

Many observers were surprised that the OCC, not known for aggressive action, fined John Stumpf $17.5 million – the largest penalty it has ever imposed on an individual – and banned him for life from the banking industry. The agency also penalized two other former senior officials at Wells Fargo and charged five others. Among those five is Carrie Tolstedt, the former head of retail banking at Wells, against whom the OCC is seeking a penalty of $25 million, substantially more than what Stumpf agreed to pay.

OCC’s belated severity may have something to do with the fact that the agency’s posture toward Wells is the subject of a pending investigation by the Treasury inspector general. That inquiry will likely address the failure of the agency to pursue complaints it had received about abusive practices at Wells long before the sham-account scandal erupted in 2016. The agency admitted this lapse in an unflattering report about its conduct released in 2017.

Along with the announcement of its charges against Tolstedt and the others, the OCC released a 100 page Notice which reads like an indictment. It argues that for more than a decade the bank maintained a business model that pressured employees to engage in “serious misconduct” by imposing “intentionally unreasonable sales goals” and “fostered an atmosphere that perpetuated improper and illegal conduct.”

The document relates in detail how that pressure worked to the detriment both of the customers who were being defrauded and the bank’s lower level employees. Those employees were turned into accomplices in a corrupt scheme described by the document as “immense” in magnitude.

Also contained in the document are indications that Wells managers were seeking to cover up the wrongdoing. They pretended to monitor improper conduct by lower-level employees but were far from aggressive in that effort. The document notes that the bank’s Head of Corporate Investigations testified before the OCC that there was nearly a 100% chance an employee’s boss would know if she failed to meet her sales goals, but the chances were very small that an employee would be caught for issuing an unauthorized product or service. Those employees clearly got the message that if they wanted to keep their jobs they had to go along with the scheme.

Unfortunately, the document is part of a civil proceeding when it should really be part of a criminal case against Wells and those who were running it. The shocking misconduct outlined by the OCC belongs in an indictment brought under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act.

There are reports that the Justice Department is pursuing a criminal investigation of Wells, but it is hard to be confident that Bill Barr’s DOJ will do the right thing.",fines support the misbehavior

Under the terms of Executive Order 13581, the US Treasury has been seeking to locate and freeze assets associated with key organized crime kingpins, a range of Japanese, Latin American, Italian and Russian/Eurasian ne’er-do-wells. On 30 October, a new set of targets was announced, including six people and four businesses “linked to the Brothers’ Circle, a Eurasian crime syndicate.” I’ve written elsewhere (here and here) that I still do not believe that the Brothers’ Circle, as a specific crime group or “coordinating body”, actually exists and instead that it is a—perfectly reasonable—fiction-of-convenience to allow this Order to be applied against criminals operating within the very loose and often mutable networks of Russian/Eurasian crime.

The latest targets are all reportedly associated with two specific figures, Vladislav Leontyev and Gafur Rakhimov, who were designated back in 2012, both of whom are definitely bad news and especially involved in transnational drug trafficking in Asia, the Middle East and Europe. These newer designated targets are also essentially lesser figures: agents, messengers, money-movers and the like (not a bad thing, for reasons I go into below). These are Treasury’s claims:

Vadim Lyalin serves as a conduit for passing messages on behalf of Vladislav Leontyev. He is based in Dubai.

Grigory Lepsveridze (known as ‘Grisha’ or ‘Grigory Leps’) couriers money on behalf of Vladislav Leontyev.

Igor Shlykov (‘Shlyk’) has worked to get identification documents and to develop business opportunities in Africa on Vladislav Leontyev’s behalf. Igor Shlykov also owns or controls MS Group Invest OOO and Meridian Jet Management GmbH based in Russia and Austria respectively (both businesses are also designated).

Gurgen House FZCO is owned or controlled by Lazar Shaybazian who was designated in February 2012, for acting for or on behalf of Vladislav Leontyev. Gurgen House FZCO has offices in the U.A.E., Uzbekistan, and Russia. Lazar Shaybazian uses Gurgen House FZCO to move money.

Sergey Moskalenko and Yakov Rybalskiy act for or on behalf of Gafur Rakhimov. Moskalenko is an Uzbek citizen now resident in Switzerland, Rybalskiy is Israeli.

Artur Badalyan and his company Fasten Tourism LLC are used by key members of the Brothers’ Circle to courier money and make travel arrangements. Artur Badalyan is the owner and CEO of Fasten Tourism LLC, which is based in Dubai.

Here is a handy chart the Treasury also provided, also again it probably makes the relationships and groupings rather too neat:

20131030_brothers_circle

Overall, I’m a fan of this approach, especially as it now extends to associates and agents. The real aim in my opinion is not just freezing individuals’ assets—that’s a good thing, of course—but also making designated figures toxic within their networked underworld, such that no one wants to do business with them, organize joint criminal ventures, launder their money or launder money with them, for fear of their assets also getting locked. Anything that strikes at the connections that make these networks effective is very good news indeed.

On the other hand, I was quite surprised about Lepsveridze ’s name being on the list, as Лепс is one of Russia’s highest grossing singers, whose music started in the Russky shanson style—rooted in criminal ballads—but has since progressed into more mainstream directions. Of course there is nothing new about criminals and entertainers being connected, just as Frank Sinatra or— reportedly —Iosif Kobzon. But I do wonder about the political fallout that may ensue. Maybe it’s not something about which Treasury really cares (and I can see the temptation in not caring), but I suspect this will cause quite an uproar in Russia. As is, police cooperation between the USA and Russia is quite tricky and sometimes politically-complex. I do hope that this does not raise further obstacles. But that said, if Treasury are sure of their facts, then it shouldn’t matter if the criminal associates are famous or not, they ought to be on the list.",organized crime

Germany's former chancellor Gerhard Schröder was yesterday at the centre of damaging allegations of sleaze over his decision to accept a lucrative job with Russia's biggest company.

Opposition MPs joined forces to denounce Mr Schröder - who last week confirmed that he was to become chairman of state-controlled Russian giant Gazprom's North European Gas Pipeline company. Mr Schröder was accused of bringing German politics into disrepute and of ""cronyism"" and ""corruption"".

Mr Schröder signed the controversial pipeline deal for a $6bn (£3.4bn) gas link between Germany and Russia under the Baltic Sea with Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, just two weeks before leaving office.

The former chancellor yesterday rejected the criticism and announced that he would take legal action over reports he would be paid between €200,000 (£134,000) and €1m a year. Those figures are ""much too high"", Mr Schröder told the Süddeutsche Zeitung newspaper.

""For me it is a thing of honour to help with the pipeline project,"" he was quoted as saying. ""I supported the project politically in the past because I think it makes sense.""

In May Mr Schröder abruptly announced he was holding Germany's general election a year early. He stepped down last month when his Social Democrat party joined a grand coalition under Angela Merkel.

Mrs Merkel's Christian Democrats have called on Mr Schröder to resign. ""He's done grave damage to Germany's reputation. Unless he quits, his job will look like a reward for his efforts [as chancellor],"" Christian Wulf, the minister-president of Lower Saxony, told Bild yesterday.

""It stinks. It looks to me like sheer cronyism,"" said Richard Bütikofer, the co-leader of Germany's Greens. Even Mr Schröder's old cabinet colleague Peter Struck, Germany's former defence minister, expressed doubts. ""I wouldn't have done it,"" he said.

Unlike Britain, Germany does not have a code of conduct preventing ex-ministers from immediately joining industry once they have left government. But yesterday several MPs said Germany should now consider emulating Britain to prevent - as one put it - the ""whiff of corruption"".

In Mr Schröder's seven years in office he failed to criticise Russia's human rights record in Chechnya, praising Mr Putin as a ""thorough democrat"".",corruption

Former Kosovo ruling party legislator Azem Syla, whom prosecutors accuse of running an organized crime gang that they say deprived the state and Kosovo Serbs of property worth about 30 million Euros (US$ 34 million), was heard in closed session at a Pristina court on Tuesday, reports Balkan Insight.

Syla's case revolves around plots of land the alleged crime group, composed of Kosovo and Serbian citizens, had allegedly acquired cheaply through bribing public officials and falsifying official documentation.

Syla was meant to be detained on April 27, a day after Kosovo prosecutors ordered a crackdown on the alleged organized crime gang. Together with the European Union's police mission in Kosovo (EULEX), local police arrested six alleged members of the group and raided 42 locations that day.

He had left the country, but returned to Kosovo within a couple of days to face the allegations. He was finally arrested on April 29.

According to local news portal Lajmi.net, his lawyer Tome Gashi said Syla was not aware of any investigation against him when he left.

While still being sought by Kosovo authorities, on April 28, Gazeta Express reported that Syla announced his resignation from Parliament in a statement without revealing his location.

While calling the case against him “unfair”, he expressed his willingness to cooperate with authorities.

At the time, prosecutors said the group is composed of about 40 people, but according to newer news reports, prosecutors believe the group is composed of more than 50 members.

Prosecutors allege that since 2006, Syla and his associates ""misused"" the rights of Serb families to certain plots of land while they were temporarily seized by the Basic Court in Pristina, pending a decision to return them to their original owners once the legal status of the properties is clarified.

After the NATO bombing of 1999 and the withdrawal of all Serbian institutions, these properties and other legal issues have fallen into limbo. It was believed that these issues would be resolved as part of the ongoing EU-facilitated dialogue between Kosovo and Serbia.

Kosovo Serbs who fled Kosovo after 1999 sold the properties cheaply, not having any intention to return to the now independent Albanian-majority country.

Reuters reported investigators believe the scheme involved officials and businessmen who bought state-owned land cheaply, only to sell it for a larger profit.

Syla and his alleged associates are accused of abusing their official position, money laundering, falsifying official documents and receiving bribes.

According to Balkan Insight, EULEX prosecutor Danilo Cecarelli said Syla's court hearing was closed to the public because the case is still being investigated.",

The vice chancellor of the University of Zimbabwe has been arrested in connection with an investigation into the awarding of a doctorate to former first lady Grace Mugabe.

Levi Nyagura was detained by the country's anti-corruption agency, to be charged with abuse of office.

Mrs Mugabe was awarded a PhD just months after enrolling in 2014, despite it usually taking years to complete.

An investigation was launched after a petition was made by university staff.

Members of the sociology department said they had not seen supporting evidence, and called for the nullification of her qualification and a full investigation.

The polarising Grace Mugabe

The PhD's authenticity was questioned because her thesis was not published alongside others at the time.

The document was only published online in January this year, four years after she graduated, and has been the subject of intense speculation since.

She was awarded the qualification by her husband and then-President Robert Mugabe, who was also the chancellor of the university at the time.

The doctorate title was used on campaign material for Mrs Mugabe as she became increasingly involved in politics.

In November Robert Mugabe was ousted from office after 37 years of rule amid growing speculation his wife was lining herself up to replace her aging husband in power.",corruption charges

SAN DIEGO (KUSI) – For 39 years, the Hunter family has represented San Diego in the 50th Congressional District, but that may come to an end next year.

Hunter is charged with using campaign funds for personal expenses, ranging from groceries to family vacations. The trial date for Congressman Duncan D. Hunter’s corruption charges was scheduled for Jan. 22, 2020.

In an exclusive interview with KUSI’s Steve Bosh, Congressman Duncan D. Hunter announced that he will plead guilty to one count of misuse of campaign funds in Tuesday’s court appearance.

The congressman said that he will admit to one count of misusing campaign funds, saying he was doing so for the sake of his three children.

His wife, the former campaign treasurer, previously admitted her role in the campaign finance scandal.

Hunter, who had planned to seek another term in the November 2020 election, indicated in the interview that he would step down, while stressing that it’s important to keep the seat in Republican hands. Hunter said his office “would remain open” and that there would be a “seamless transition to whoever takes this seat next.”

Hunter’s announcement was updated on the U.S. District Court docket Monday morning. His change of plea hearing is set for December 3, 2019 at 10:00 AM before Judge Thomas J. Whelan.

Hunter, 42, was indicted along with his wife on five dozen criminal counts, including wire fraud, conspiracy and falsification of records, and was facing a Jan. 22 trial date.

Margaret Hunter, 44, pleaded guilty in June to a conspiracy charge and agreed to work with prosecutors on the case. She faces up to five years in federal custody and a fine of up to $250,000 when she is sentenced in April.

Hunter said that while he expects to spend time in custody, he hopes that his wife will not be incarcerated as “I think my kids need a mom in the home.”

Duncan D. Hunter was re-elected last November with 51.7% of the vote in the 50th Congressional District, despite being indicted three months prior. He was first elected in 2008, succeeding his father, who held the congressional seat for 28 years.

Since the charges were brought against Hunter, several challengers have entered the race for the 50th Congressional District, most of whom are fellow Republicans.

Rep. Hunter is being challenged by former Congressman Darrell Issa, Carl DeMaio, State Senator Brian Jones, as well as Democrat Ammar Campa-Najjar.

Former Congressman Darrell Issa released the following statement in response to Hunter’s announcement.

“As a friend and a colleague, I thank Duncan Hunter for his service to our country in the Marine Corps and in Congress, where he has always been a strong conservative voice on behalf of his constituents. Though his misuse of campaign funds was clearly wrong, I wish him and his family the best as they address the matters ahead of them.”

Issa stopped by the KUSI News studio Monday morning to further explain what Hunter’s guilty plea means, and how it impacts the highly contested race for the 50th Congressional District. His complete remarks can be seen here.

Former San Diego City Councilman Carl Demaio, who is challenging Hunter for the seat, issued a statement Monday regarding the development.

“While this must have been a tough decision for him, Congressman Hunter’s decision to plead guilty is the right one for his family and his constituents and shows that no one should be above the law — especially members of Congress,” he said. “My thoughts and prayers are with the Hunter family as they go through this difficult process.”

In an exclusive #KUSINews interview, Congressman Duncan D. Hunter says his ""only hope is that the judge does not sentence my wife to jail."" @Rep_Hunter 's change of plea hearing will be before Judge Thomas J. Whelan on December 3, 2019.

TMML2024038361489,Donald Trump,"Alert ID: TMML2024038361489
The fundamental purpose of government is rather simple: protect the citizenry. Any deliberate perversion of this priority is an exercise of corruption—especially when that basic aim is supplanted by the goal of personal gain. That’s why Donald Trump’s slow, ineffectual, self-serving, and deadly response to the coronavirus has been the most consequential act of corruption in the history of American governance. It eclipses Watergate, Teapot Dome, Iran-Contra, you name it. It also happens to be the continuation—perhaps the culmination—of the corruption that Trump started spreading like a virus the moment he tramped into the White House.

Corruption in government is generally thought of as an official exploiting power or position for personal benefit, often to line his or her pockets or those of a favored associate, relative, or corporation. There has been plenty of that during the Trump years. And Trump was impeached for an act of outright corruption. He leveraged his office—his ability to grant a foreign leader a White House meeting and to hold up nearly $400 million in military assistance—to pressure the new president of Ukraine to initiate unfounded investigations that would help Trump politically. In the case of the coronavirus crisis, Trump embraced a similar me-first course. He prevented the government from performing actions that could keep Americans safe because he believed downplaying the burgeoning crisis best served his political interests. He corrupted the mission of the US government—as a result, one hundred thousand Americans (and counting) have died and the economy collapsed. (Trump also corruptly enlisted the US military as a prop for his own political gain, when he responded to the nationwide wave of protests spurred by the police-killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis.)

Trump’s record of inaction, incompetence, and inane remarks during the first months of the pandemic has been well documented. Yet he wasn’t merely flailing. He purposefully thwarted official action because of concerns about his own electoral prospects. He resisted an aggressive push for testing because that could yield higher numbers of confirmed coronavirus cases, and he believed that lower levels would be better for his reelection campaign. When Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar warned Trump of an impending pandemic in late January, Trump brushed him off as an alarmist. Azar’s message was not in sync with Trump’s decision to discount the coronavirus threat. In late February, Nancy Messonnier, an official at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, publicly said her agency expected widespread transmission and was preparing for a pandemic. Wall Street plunged, and an enraged Trump—who had recently declared that the virus “miraculously goes away” and the situation was “very much under control”—threatened to fire her.

Trump failed to move quickly and impeded a fast and comprehensive response. His self-interest was always paramount—to an absurd extent. He touted the “ratings” his coronavirus press conferences received and devoted more time during these briefings to deflecting responsibility, attacking journalists, and blaming Democratic politicians than to mourning the dead. And his administration oversaw a $2 trillion economic rescue and bailout that was practically designed to facilitate corruption. A huge piece of it was turned over to banks to manage, and the banks rigged the system for preferred customers, which froze out many small businesses, particularly outfits owned by people of color. (In several cases, the funds went to companies—some run by Trump donors—that hardly seemed the most needy.) This package also included a pot of $500 billion for Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to distribute to large corporations with few strings attached and little public oversight. Democrats justifiably called it a “slush fund.” In a further blow to transparency, Trump ousted the inspector general who was leading the task force assigned to monitor this relief package. (This move was part of the war on IGs waged by Trump, who has sought watchdogs that are loyal to him, not the goal of corruption-busting.)

Trump’s attitude toward the federal government at the start of the pandemic— it’s all about me —was an extension of the rampant and more conventional corruption that’s defined his regime. Once Trump, the longtime narcissistic pitchman, entered the White House, he viewed the government as an expansion of his own business ventures and personal brand and showed not a whit of concern for rules, norms, and constitutional provisions that had been established to hinder corruption. He brazenly ignored the emoluments clause of the Constitution, which prohibits a president from accepting payments from foreign entities. His properties—particularly the Trump hotel in Washington, DC—became favorite spots for overseas visitors, including government officials, to stay, hold events, and wine and dine. This placed money into Trump’s bank account. (Ivanka Trump, who owns a big piece of the Washington hotel, also bags millions of dollars a year from its revenue.) Here was an easy way for foreign governments, Washington lobbyists, wannabe players, and others seeking preferential treatment and policies from Trump and his administration to engage in what amounts to legal bribery. In 2018, Trump reported income from at least 11 foreign countries. Several countries, including China, have granted Trump and Ivanka valuable trademarks—with one for Ivanka covering voting machines.

Trump’s own campaign and Republican organizations have held events at his properties, which enriches him and his family. His visits to his golf courses and Mar-a-Lago, his Palm Beach private club, have forced the Secret Service to spend millions that end up with the Trump Organization he still owns. A report first issued in mid-2019 by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington tallied more than 3,100 actions that raised possible conflicts of interest during Trump’s first years as president. Trump has steadfastly refused to follow tradition and release his tax returns.

Given the constant stream of Trump administration scandals, it is tough to keep track of the cavalcade of crookedness. Controversies come and go quickly, forming an overwhelming blur of wrongdoing and sleaze. In fact, the high number of scandals provides Trump and his crew a degree of protection. Here are a few you may have forgotten: Top adviser Kellyanne Conway appears to have repeatedly violated the Hatch Act, which prohibits federal employees from using their offices to affect the results of an election. She also used her position to promote Ivanka’s clothing line. The White House did the same with first lady Melania Trump’s jewelry company. Trump’s original heads of the EPA, the Department of the Interior, and the Department of Health and Human Services—Scott Pruitt, Ryan Zinke, and Tom Price—each resigned when faced with credible accusations of corruption. Wilbur Ross, the secretary of commerce, held on to millions of dollars in holdings and apparently violated conflict-of-interest rules. Other top Trump appointees past and present—including Ben Carson and Mick Mulvaney—have been caught engaging in shady dealings.

The Trump administration has frequently taken actions that assist industries and companies that donate to Trump and the GOP. His personal lawyer ended up in prison in part because he committed bank fraud while paying hush money to a porn star at Trump’s direction. Michael Flynn, Trump’s first national security adviser, admitted to violating lobbying laws by failing to disclose that he lobbied for Turkey, which earned him hundreds of thousands of dollars. (Flynn also pleaded guilty to lying to FBI agents during the Trump-Russia investigation—but Attorney General Barr has been trying to undo that prosecution.) Other Trump associates set up lobbying shops in the nation’s capital to cash in on their access to Trump. He didn’t drain the swamp of Washington; he turned it into a petri dish of corruption for him, his family, and his cronies.

Exhibit A: Jared Kushner. He has an honored place on the Trump corruption roll call. Government anti-nepotism rules had to be waived for him to join the White House as an adviser to his father-in-law. Kushner repeatedly did not fully reveal his holdings and potential conflicts. And his security clearance was denied because government officials were concerned about his private business interests and his vulnerability to foreign influence. No problem: Trump ordered Kushner be granted clearance.

Kushner has routinely mixed White House business with his own business. As he has advised his father-in-law on matters stretching around the globe—including the Israel-­Palestine conflict—his family real estate firm reached out to a Chinese company tied to the Chinese government and then to the Qatari government in efforts to off-load a highly indebted New York City property it owned. (A company largely owned by the Qatari government’s investment fund eventually rescued the Kushners.) Until March, Kushner also held a large interest in a real estate startup, Cadre, that launched investment vehicles made possible by a Trump administration program promoted by Kushner and Ivanka Trump.

As Trump sees it, the government does not exist to defend the people from killer viruses. It exists to protect and serve him.

During the pandemic, Kushner’s practice of blurring the line between business and government has been thrown into grotesque relief. As Trump bumbled, Kushner assembled a shadow task force—separate from Vice President Mike Pence’s entity—with members drawn from private industries that had keen interests (and perhaps conflicts of interest) related to the policies being considered. This group of investors and entrepreneurs—including a former roommate of Kushner—made supply-chain decisions that could lead to windfalls for certain corporations. The White House refused to reveal all the members of Kushner’s task force, which operated in secrecy, using private phones and personal email accounts in possible violation of federal transparency laws, and without any oversight. This was behind-the-scenes government based on Kushner’s network of business buddies. His off-the-books effort included a collection of volunteers from investment and consulting firms recruited to hand out government contracts for desperately needed equipment for the pandemic. This squad tried to facilitate deals, often involving people with inside contacts (including Fox News personalities), while generally botching the job. FEMA officials referred to Kushner’s crew as the “children.”

At the same time, Oscar Health, a health insurance company that was initially controlled by Jared and his brother, Joshua Kushner—before Joshua took solo command—was used sub rosa by the White House to develop a website for a nationwide coronavirus testing program that never materialized. (It was another false promise from Trump.) The company said it did the work for free, but this arrangement might still have breached federal law. So even in the middle of a national crisis, Kushner was freebooting and possibly grifting. There was no way to fully tell because he was defiantly ignoring the normal guidelines for government advisory panels.

As the nation suffered—thousands dying, millions confronting economic calamity—Trump turned the government’s coronavirus response into another quid pro quo. He threatened to withhold assistance from governors who did not publicly praise him. In fact, Trump proved a prediction cast during the impeachment proceedings. When Stanford law professor Pamela Karlan testified at the House hearings, she presented what at the time seemed to be no more than an intellectual exercise meant to underscore the seriousness of Trump’s effort to muscle the Ukrainian president. Imagine living in a state hit by a terrible natural disaster, she said: “What would you think if your governor asked for a meeting with the president to discuss getting disaster aid that Congress has provided for? What would you think if that president said, ‘I would like you to do us a favor. I’ll meet with you, and I’ll send the disaster relief, once you brand my opponent a criminal’? Wouldn’t you know in your gut that such a president had abused his office?” You can’t say we weren’t warned.

Trump has weakened the government the way rot ruins a building: It attacks the structure. He doesn’t give a damn about the soundness of the system. In this fashion, Trump did little to protect the country from another profound attack: the Russian assault on the American election in 2016 that was mounted to help him win. It was not in Trump’s political interest to call attention to this covert warfare, so he didn’t. He dismissed that threat and has assailed those agencies of government that investigated the attack and that have warned Moscow is now targeting the 2020 campaign.

The president’s pandemic response is straight from the same Make Trump First playbook. For all the corruption he has enabled, enacted, and exercised—that we know of—there likely remains more to be rooted out. After all, as Trump sees it, the government does not exist to defend the people from killer viruses or foreign attempts to subvert American democracy. It exists to protect and serve him. (The use of federal security forces to violently clear away peaceful protesters so Trump can hold a meaningless photo-op was a clear example of Trump-uber-alles statism.) That is the core corruption of his presidency. It is manifested in minor acts of sleaze (buy Ivanka’s stuff!), major acts of policy (let’s kill regulations for industries that donate to us), and monumental decisions with immediate life-or-death consequences for thousands of Americans (don’t warn of a pandemic because that could screw up my reelection). Graft, grift, and greed have been—and always will be—a problem in government. But with Trump, corruption kills.",corruption

MEXICO CITY —

Federal agents called in the Mexican army to arrest one of the nation’s most powerful drug barons, a man wanted in the 1993 murder of Guadalajara’s Roman Catholic cardinal, during a late-night raid that also snared 33 federal agents who were protecting him, authorities said Saturday.

Mexico’s attorney general said Hector Luis Palma Salazar, reputed leader of the Sinaloa cartel, was arrested in an exclusive neighborhood of Guadalajara and charged with several murders and drug-related crimes.

Palma allegedly took over one of the five major cartels that U.S. drug enforcement agents say transport three-fourths of the cocaine entering the United States after its previous leader was jailed in the murder of the cardinal, Juan Jesus Posadas Ocampo. Palma was also wanted in connection with that crime, and the Mexican government had posted a $1-million reward for information leading to his capture.

The arrests late Friday were seen as a clear sign of President Ernesto Zedillo’s commitment to crack down on the cartels. They also underscored the close ties that exist between drug kingpins and some federal officials.

Confirming Palma’s arrest at an evening news conference in Mexico City, Atty. Gen. Antonio Lozano said the army was called in as a precaution because federal police were directly involved with Palma.

Mexican soldiers formed a cordon around the Guadalajara office of the federal attorney general--to guard against retaliation--while agents from Mexico City arrested Palma, along with Apolinar Pintor Aguilera, the federal judicial police commander. Jalisco state authorities said Palma identified Pintor as his “protector.”

Authorities also detained 33 federal police officers who they said had been serving as Palma’s personal bodyguards. Lozano said his agents seized large quantities of drugs and about $10,000 in cash.

Palma was reportedly a lieutenant of Joaquin (Chapo) Guzman, former leader of the cartel in Sinaloa, a state notorious for violence and marijuana production. U.S. and Mexican officials said the cartel has extensive networks in Central and South America and has been instrumental in exporting Colombian cocaine into the United States through Mexico.

Authorities said Palma became the cartel’s leader after Guzman’s arrest in 1993. Guzman has also been charged with participating in the murder of Posadas, who was shot more than a dozen times in what the previous government called a case of mistaken identity.

Lozano, the first attorney general to come from an opposition political party, has vowed to arrest the leaders of all the major cartels and to solve several high-profile political murders, among them the killing of the cardinal.

Religious leaders and human rights groups have cast doubt on the official version of the slaying on March 24, 1993, outside the Guadalajara airport. Posadas was an outspoken critic of the drug cartels that Mexican and U.S. drug enforcement officials say have infiltrated the government at high enough levels to threaten the nation’s stability.

Officials now say the airport slaying, in which six others died, was masterminded by the Arellano Felix brothers and their Tijuana drug cartel, a rival of Palma’s Sinaloa cartel. One of the four brothers, Francisco Arellano Felix, has been captured, but the three others remain at large. There is a $1-million reward for information leading to the arrest of any of the brothers.

Authorities have not released details of what roles Guzman and Palma allegedly played in the cardinal’s assassination.

The cardinal’s slaying was the first in a series of political murders that caused billions of dollars in investment to flee the country, helping to trigger Mexico’s continuing economic crisis and fueling national insecurity.

A year after Posadas’ death, ruling party presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio was slain in Tijuana. And six months after that, the party’s secretary general, Francisco Ruiz Massieu, was shot to death in Mexico City.",

A California man has been sentenced to five years in prison for selling forged artworks. Philip Righter pleaded guilty on Wednesday to three felony charges of wire fraud, aggravated identity theft, and tax fraud as part of a counterfeit art scheme that he ran for roughly two years.

Topmost among Righter’s offenses is the sale of works he falsely claimed were originals by Jean-Michel Basquiat, Keith Haring, Roy Lichtenstein, and Andy Warhol. Between 2016 and 2018, Righter used counterfeit paintings to conduct transactions in both his own name and under other people’s identities. To support his claims that the works were real, Righter created false provenance documents, going so far as to impersonate a member of Basquiat’s estate in his creation of a fraudulent certificate of authenticity. Over the course of his scheme, Righter attempted to sell roughly $6 million in counterfeit art.

He also attempted to use the fraudulent works as collateral for loans he later defaulted on, and also used their falsified value for write-offs on a tax return. One victim was defrauded of $24,000 after attempting to sell a fake Basquiat that Righter had used as loan collateral at auction. He also provided an online auction site with a Basquiat piece that sold for $50,000, which the site had to refund the buyer after the piece was proven to be fake. All told, Righter’s scheme cost victims at least $758,265, and the government around $100,000 in taxes.

Shady Turkish-Iranian businessman Reza Zarrab’s money laundering scheme was revealed in leaked U.S. files.

According to the files, the United Arab Emirates’ central bank, UK-based Standard Chartered and Deutsche Bank took part in Zarrab’s scheme.

The FinCEN files are a huge cache of secret reports detailing suspicious financial activity, filed by banks to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), a bureau of the U.S. Treasury Department (USTD).

BuzzFeed News obtained the files and shared them with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ). Over the past 16 months, 400 journalists from 88 countries have been investigating the documents.

Leaked documents showed Dubai-based Gunes General Trading, which is alleged by the U.S. prosecutors of being a part of a network controlled by Zarrab that conducted hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of transactions on behalf of the Iranian government and other Iranian entities that were barred under U.S. sanctions, processed $142m in suspicious transactions through the UAE financial system in 2011 and 2012.

The activity was flagged by a British bank, but the firm was able to continue using local financial institutions, BBC reported.

Suspicious transactions by Gunes General Trading

Banks based in the UAE rely on big U.S.-based banks to monitor and approve their US dollar payments – a service known as “correspondent banking.”

Correspondent banks are required to alert authorities to potential instances of criminal activity, such as money laundering or terrorist financing, by filing a document known as a suspicious activity report (SAR).

Among the FinCEN files is an SAR that shows the New York branch of Standard Chartered Bank contacted the Central Bank of the UAE in 2012 after noticing hundreds of suspicious transactions by Gunes General Trading. The reports did not say any of this activity was linked to sanctions evasion by Iran.

SARs are a way to alert government regulators and law enforcement to irregular activity that should be investigated, although they are not necessarily evidence of wrongdoing.

The central bank told Standard Chartered that “the case has been passed on to law enforcement authorities” and that “accounts were closed in September 2011.”

But Standard Chartered flagged that the company was able to “continue its suspicious activity” by “utilizing various accounts that [it] maintains with other banks.”

In fact, the central bank failed to stop Gunes General Trading using two other accounts with two UAE state-owned banks – Rakbank, the national bank of the northern emirate Ras al-Khaimah, and the National Bank of Dubai (NBD).

The FinCEN files show Gunes General Trading was able to process a further $108m of transactions flagged as suspicious until September 2012, the majority of them through Rakbank.

In April 2013, the U.S. Bank of New York Mellon filed a SAR saying that following a U.S. government inquiry into Gunes General Trading, it believed the company was conducting transactions in a manner designed to evade sanctions against Iran.

The FinCEN Files also suggest that Deutsche Bank continued to move money for people and companies deemed suspicious, as indicated by SAR filings from the bank, after it received a $258 million fine for violating U.S. sanctions in 2015, Deutsche Welle reported.

Deutsche Bank’s U.S. affiliate, Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas (TCA), submitted an SAR about a company with close ties to Zarrab to FinCEN in March 2017. The report states that the company, Nadir Döviz, which is involved in the gold trade, had more than $28 million transferred in its name.

Turkey ‘a high-risk country’

Deutsche Bank TCA filed its SAR because Nadir Döviz was being investigated for its involvement in a money-laundering scheme. The document says the transactions occurred between March 2016 and February 2017.

In its report, Deutsche Bank stated that the suspicious activities were intra-company payments dispersed between several Turkish banks. “This SAR is being filed because the transactions originated from a high-risk country [Turkey], there were multiple large, round dollar transactions, and no commercial purpose was identified through the transaction details,” it reads.

One of these suspicious transactions was for $1.5 million from Nadir Döviz in Turkey to Nadir Gold in Dubai on Sept. 12, 2016. No reason was provided for the transfer.

Upon receiving a catalogue of detailed questions from ICIJ, a spokesman for Deutsche Bank said the information contained in the files is “not new information to us or our regulators” and that these issues date back to the years prior to 2016, adding that Deutsche Bank is “a different bank now.”

In his statement from Sept. 9, the spokesman emphasized: “We acknowledged past weaknesses in our control environment, we apologized for this and accepted our respective fines. Most importantly: We learned from our mistakes, systematically tackled the issues and made changes to our business perimeter, our controls, and our personnel.”

The dates of the recorded Suspicious Activity Reports raise questions about how much Deutsche Bank knew about Döviz’s connection to Zarrab and the Turkish trader’s involvement in what turned out to be a gold for oil scheme to circumvent sanctions against Iran.

Reza Zarrab’s billion-dollar scheme

When Iranian banks were cut off from the global SWIFT transaction system, the country’s companies could no longer use international banking transfers to receive payment for oil and gas exports.

To get around the ban, Iran began collecting gold as payments instead. Reza Zarrab played a key role in this billion-dollar scheme to help Iran evade sanctions.

Zarrab was first indicted and arrested in December 2013 in Turkey, as part of a larger corruption investigation aimed at ministers in the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) government. Among the charges directed at him were bribing ministers, money laundering and gold smuggling.

According to a report by Turkish prosecutors at the time, Zarrab used Nadir Döviz for buying gold. Zarrab’s bagman Adem Karahan later told Turkish daily Cumhuriyet, that he was a cash courier for money going from Dubai to Turkey and from Dubai to Iran.

One of the companies he received money from was Nadir Gold LLC, a subsidiary of Nadir Döviz in Dubai. It is precisely these two companies that Deutsche Bank lists in its March 2017 Suspicious Activity Report to FinCEN.

At the time, the administration of President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan refuted all allegations against Zarrab and likened the investigation to a coup attempt, purging and arresting the prosecutors who initiated it. After two and a half months in prison, Zarrab was released.

In March 2016 Zarrab was arrested again, this time in the U.S. while on route to Disney World with his family. U.S. authorities accused him of money laundering, fraud and helping the Iranian government to evade the economic sanctions.

He pleaded guilty and later testified as a protected star witness in a trial against a manager of Turkey’s Halkbank.

During this trial in November 2017, Zarrab claimed that Turkish government officials, including Erdoğan, had allowed Halkbank to create a complex web of shell companies and sham transactions in gold to help Iran get around U.S. sanctions.",

WASHINGTON – Diego Montoya Sanchez, 48, one of the leaders of the Norte Valle Colombian drug cartel and a former FBI Top Ten Fugitive, pleaded guilty today in Miami to drug trafficking, murder and racketeering charges, the Justice Department announced.
The pleas were announced by Acting U. S. Attorney Jeffrey H. Sloman for the Southern District of Florida, Acting U.S. Attorney Lev L. Dassin for the Southern District of New York, Assistant Attorney General Lanny A. Breuer of the Criminal Division, FBI Executive Assistant Director Thomas J. Harrington and Acting Administrator Michele M. Leonhart of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration.

Montoya Sanchez appeared before U.S. District Judge Cecilia M. Altonaga in Miami, where he pleaded guilty in two pending federal cases. In the first case, which was indicted in the Southern District of Florida by the U.S. Attorney’s Office, Montoya pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to import more than five kilograms of cocaine into the United States and one count of obstruction of justice by murder.

In the second case, which was indicted in the District of Columbia jointly by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York (SDNY) and the Criminal Division’s Narcotic and Dangerous Drug Section (NDDS), Montoya Sanchez pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to engage in a pattern of racketeering activity. The SDNY/NDDS indictment was transferred to the Southern District of Florida for the guilty plea.

Following the decline of the Cali Cartel in the mid-1990s, the Norte Valle Cartel emerged to become Colombia’s most prolific cocaine trafficking cartel. Based upon FBI estimates, at its peak the Norte Valle Cartel was responsible for 60 percent of the cocaine exported from Colombia to the United States. According to the SDNY/NDDS indictment, between 1990 and 2004, the Norte Valle Cartel exported more than 1.2 million pounds, or 500 metric tons, of cocaine worth more than $10 billion from Colombia to the United States.

According to the statement of facts submitted in conjunction with today’s hearing, Montoya Sanchez was a high-level Colombian drug trafficker for more than two decades. In the mid-1980s, Montoya Sanchez ran cocaine laboratories that served many significant traffickers. In the late 1980s, Montoya Sanchez expanded his organization’s operations into smuggling plane loads of cocaine from Colombia to Mexico. According to the statement of facts, by the early 1990s, Montoya Sanchez had switched to maritime smuggling. During the course of the next 15 years, Montoya Sanchez’s organization routinely smuggled cocaine loads between 1,000 and 6,000 kilos at a time using go-fast boats and fishing boats, among other methods.

By the late 1990s, Montoya Sanchez and Wilber Varela emerged to become the Norte Valle Cartel’s two leading kingpins. Mounting tensions between the Montoya and Varela organizations led to a two-year war between the organizations in which each targeted the other’s members for murder. The Montoya-Varela war, which lasted from fall 2003 until fall 2005, resulted in hundreds of deaths, including those of innocent civilians.

At today’s hearing, Montoya Sanchez admitted that his organization’s practices included using violence and murder against people his organization feared were cooperating with law enforcement. Montoya Sanchez specifically admitted to the August 2003 murder of a one-time organization member who was believed to have been cooperating with authorities.

In May 2004, the FBI added Montoya Sanchez to its list of ten most wanted fugitives. On Sept. 10, 2007, Colombian authorities mounted an operation on a believed Montoya hide-out at a ranch in a rural area outside of Zarzal, Valle del Cauca, Colombia, and captured Montoya Sanchez hiding in a creek-bed approximately 700 yards from the ranch. Montoya Sanchez was extradited from Colombia to Miami on Dec. 12, 2008.

Jeffrey H. Sloman, Acting U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida, stated, ""From the prosecution and conviction of the leaders of the Cali Cartel, to the conviction of Ze’ev Rosenstein and an Israel-based Ecstasy network, to today’s dismantling of the Norte Valle Cartel, the Southern District of Florida has had a long and successful history in the war on drugs. We will continue to focus our energy, and the expertise of our prosecutors, to help our law enforcement partners stem the tide of drugs flooding our streets and poisoning our society.""

""Diego Montoya Sanchez was the leader of a dangerous, violent drug organization,"" said Thomas J. Harrington, Executive Assistant Director of the FBI. ""Outstanding cooperation between Colombia and the United States was key to his capture, the capture of others, and the effective dismantling of the Norte Valle Cartel. The FBI and its law enforcement partners, both here and overseas, will continue to work together to eliminate other international organized crime threats.""

""The prosecution of Montoya Sanchez is a milestone in the efforts to dismantle the Norte Valle Cartel, one of the world’s most powerful and dangerous drug-trafficking cartels,"" said Acting U.S. Attorney Lev L. Dassin for the Southern District of New York. ""Montoya Sanchez’s arrest and extradition marked the end of his long campaign of violence and corruption. We are grateful to our partners at the DEA and in the Colombian government for their tireless work in this investigation.""

""Montoya Sanchez’s path to the top of the Norte Valle Cartel was marked by decades of extreme violence. That path has now ended in a prison cell, where the man who personally helped direct multi-ton shipments of addictive and destructive narcotics into American cities and towns will be held for his crimes,"" said Assistant Attorney General Lanny A. Breuer of the Criminal Division. ""This conviction is a major victory in the joint effort by Colombia and the United States to disrupt and dismantle these drug trafficking organizations, made possible through extensive cooperation with our partners in the Southern District of Florida, the Southern District of New York, the DEA and the FBI.""

""This notorious leader of the extremely violent Norte Valle Cartel is where he belongs: behind bars for murder, drug trafficking and racketeering,"" said Acting DEA Administrator Michele M. Leonhart. ""Due to the skilled and brave work by the men and women of DEA and the Colombian National Police, justice has been served for the many victims of his cartel’s extreme violence and the tons of cocaine that ended up on American streets. Now he is in prison, no longer able to use his power to destroy others or benefit from his ill-gotten gains.""

Montoya Sanchez is the fourth member of his family to be convicted as part of the case out of the Southern District of Florida. In January 2009, Montoya Sanchez’s brother, Eugenio Montoya Sanchez, pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to import more than five kilograms of cocaine into the United States and one count of obstruction of justice by murder and was subsequently sentenced to 30 years in prison. In November 2005, Montoya Sanchez’s brother, Juan Carlos Montoya Sanchez, and his cousin, Carlos Felipe Toro Sanchez, both pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to import more than five kilograms of cocaine into the United States. They were sentenced to terms of 262 and 235 months in prison, respectively.

According to in-court statements during the hearing, Diego Montoya Sanchez agreed to serve a 45-year prison term for the crimes outlined in the court documents. Sentencing has been scheduled for Oct. 21, 2009, at 8:30 a.m. before Judge Altonaga.

The Southern District of Florida indictment is being prosecuted by the U.S. Attorney’s Office and was investigated by the FBI. The SDNY/NDDS indictment was the result of a multi-district investigation and is being prosecuted jointly by SDNY and NDDS, and was investigated by the DEA. The Criminal Division’s Office of International Affairs and NDDS Judicial Attachés in Bogota, Colombia provided significant assistance in both cases. U.S. law enforcement received invaluable assistance in its prosecution of Diego Montoya Sanchez from the Government of Colombia, the Colombian National Police and the Colombian Army.",pleaded guilty

Following the 2002 Bali bombings, Indonesia confronted a seemingly unmanageable terrorist problem. Over the next decade, however, the country became widely viewed as a counter-terrorism success story as the threat from al-Qaeda-linked or -inspired jihadist groups declined dramatically. Unfortunately, the transnational pull of the conflicts in Syria and Iraq, and the emergence of the Islamic State, risk undermining Indonesia’s counter-terrorism successes.

Background

In the early 2000s, a range of jihadist groups operated across the Indonesian archipelago. These were not initially considered a major security concern by the government, as Indonesia prioritized rebuilding its economy after the Asian Financial Crisis and consolidating its democracy after overcoming a 32-year-long dictatorship. Additionally, most of these groups confined their violence to the islands of Maluku and Sulawesi, where communal conflicts had broken out between Muslims and Christians.

One such group, Jemaah Islamiyah (JI), had a close relationship with al-Qaeda, dating back to the 1980s foreign fighter mobilization against the Soviets in Afghanistan. JI’s co-founders Abdullah Sungkar and Abu Bakar Bashir were hesitant to follow Osama bin Laden’s 1998 call for attacks on Western military and civilian targets, but one faction of JI chose to join al-Qaeda’s global war. This faction was led by Riduan Isamuddin, a.k.a. Hambali, who had a close operational relationship with 9/11 architect Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. Hambali’s JI faction bombed churches across Indonesia, unsuccessfully attempted to attack the U.S. Embassy in Singapore and in October 2002, bombed tourist venues in Bali, killing 202 people. [1]

In response, Indonesia launched a police-led counter-terrorism campaign, assisted by Australia, the United States and other countries, arresting hundreds of suspected militants. Hambali himself was arrested in Thailand, suspected of planning an attack against the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Bangkok (The Age, August 15, 2003). One of the Bali bombers, Noordin Mohammad Top, stepped in to Hambali’s role and continued attacking Western-associated targets in Indonesia. His faction bombed the Jakarta Marriot Hotel in September 2003, the Australian Embassy in September 2004 and Bali tourist venues again in October 2005 (Kompas, August 9, 2003).

Each bombing led to further arrests by Detachment 88, a new counter-terrorism unit within the Indonesian National Police. In response to the crackdown, JI’s leadership distanced itself from Noordin’s breakaway faction and eschewed mass-casualty attacks on foreign targets. Instead, they sought a secure base in Poso, a Sulawesi town recovering from recent communal conflict. JI’s Poso network focused on killing Christians and government officials, and in 2005, shocked the nation by beheading three Christian schoolgirls (Jakarta Post, April 26, 2013). In 2007, Detachment 88 killed and arrested many members of the network, prompting JI to cease violence and focus on gradually rebuilding itself.

JI was further weakened in 2008, when their former leader Abu Bakar Bashir created a new organization, Jemaah Ansharut Tauhid (JAT), taking many JI members with him. [2] Noordin’s network, also weakened by counter-terrorism efforts, failed to launch another major attack until July 2009, when it bombed Jakarta’s Marriot and Ritz-Carlton hotels. Detachment 88 killed Noordin in raids after the attack, and his network did not recover (Jakarta Post, August 8, 2009).

Following these setbacks, Indonesian jihadism took a different direction. Leading figures, including clerics and fighters, rejected both the Noordin network’s strategy of prioritizing foreign targets and JI’s approach of favoring outreach over action. Instead they established a training camp in Aceh province, which had experienced decades of separatist conflict. The camp involved every major Indonesian jihadist group except for JI, and received funding from Abu Bakar Bashir’s JAT. Their plan was to hold territory and gradually build up an insurgency, which they saw as the approach taken in the southern Philippines, southern Thailand and Chechnya. [3]

They miscalculated. The aspiring insurgents lacked popular support, and locals soon tipped off the police. In early 2010, Detachment 88 launched raids, killing eight of the militants and arresting 48 others in the following months. [4] Aman Abdurrahman, the camp’s leading spiritual authority, was jailed. Bashir was later jailed for providing funding (Kompas, June 19, 2011).

Indonesian jihadism, thereafter, only continued at a low level. Fragmented networks of jihadists turned to small-scale attacks, robbing stores and killing police officers. Attempted attacks on foreign targets became rare, except for a possible plot against tourists in Bali in 2012 and a failed attempt to bomb the Myanmar Embassy in 2013 (Jakarta Globe, March 22, 2012; Jakarta Post, January 22, 2014). Counter-terrorism efforts had suppressed the most violent networks, but pools of supporters remained and waited for opportunities, which were soon provided by the conflict in Syria.

Indonesian Jihadists in Syria and Iraq

From 2012, Indonesia’s radical Islamist organizations watched the Syrian war closely. Abu Bakar Bashir described the conflict as a “university for jihad education,” and Indonesians joined a range of groups, including the Islamic State (then the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria—ISIS) and al-Qaeda affiliate Jabhat al-Nusra. [5] Their first “martyr” was announced in November 2013, by a Syrian Islamist militia, the Suqour al-Izz Brigade. They claimed Riza Fardi, an Indonesian who had been studying in Yemen and then joined the Syrian uprising, had died fighting in eastern Ghouta (Inside Indonesia, August 3).

By 2014, the Islamic State had become the most popular group for Indonesian jihadists, who began to appear in its propaganda (Tempo, January 5). The al-Hayat Center, an Islamic State media outlet, released an eight-minute Bahasa Indonesian-language video on July 23, 2014, called “Join the Ranks” (Tempo, January 4). The video featured a man later identified as Bahrum Syah, who was a follower of Amman Abdurrahman and left Indonesia in March 2014, at the age of 29 (Kompas, August 6, 2014; Kompas, August 8, 2014). Bahrum Syah called upon “the brothers in Indonesia, [to] have patience, be upright upon tauhid (monotheism) and put all your effort into using your physical and financial strength to emigrate to the Islamic State, for hijrah (migration) today is obligatory. It is an obligation decreed by Allah the Exalted.” [6]

In September 2014, Indonesian and Malaysian Islamic State fighters announced the existence of a Bahasa-speaking unit called “Katibah Nusantara Lid Daulah Islamiyah,” meaning the Malay Archipelago unit of the Islamic State. [7] The unit has at least 22 members with combat experience, reportedly brought together because their lack of English and Arabic proficiency created a need for their own unit (Kompas, May 26, 2014).

There are competing estimates of how many Indonesians are involved with jihadist groups in Syria and Iraq. One of the most widely-used estimates is that up to 500 have joined the conflict, including fighters, but also their wives and families (The Strategist, July 17). Around 40 have reportedly been killed (The Australian, July 1). Given Indonesia’s Muslim population is an estimated 209 million, 500 people does not represent a dramatically large level of involvement in Syria and Iraq. [8] Despite this, the conflict’s potential to reinvigorate Indonesian jihadism has led to a proactive response by the government.

Developments at Home

Indonesian authorities are greatly concerned about the foreign fighter mobilization and have arrested several suspects. One suspect was Afif Abdul Majid, who had been the head of JAT’s Central Java branch, had helped fund the failed Aceh camp and was placed on the U.S. Treasury Department’s sanctions list for his terrorist involvement (U.S. Department of Treasury, September 18, 2013). He was arrested in August 2014, after returning from Syria. In December 2014, police arrested a group of six people suspected of planning to join the Islamic State, and then arrested a seventh person, thought to have facilitated their attempted travel (Kompas, December 27, 2014). In March 2015, three suspected Syria returnees were arrested (Jakarta Post, March 27). That same month, Turkish police arrested 16 Indonesians suspected of trying to join the Islamic State (Kompas, March 19). Indonesian police then arrested four men for allegedly arranging travel documents (for these 16 suspected Islamic State supporters and 21 others) (Malay Mail, March 23). 12 of the suspects deported from Turkey were subsequently entered into a de-radicalization program (Kompas, March 26).

However, securing convictions has been difficult. Prosecutors could not convict Afif Abdul Majid for his activities in Syria, even though he admitted training with the Islamic State and pledging allegiance to them (Jakarta Post, July 10). The government banned the militant organization in August 2014, but it is not currently clear what the ban means in practice (Tempo, January 5).

Indonesia’s jihadist groups have increasingly taken inspiration from the Islamic State. Aman Abdurrahman, currently imprisoned for his role in the Aceh camp, pledged allegiance in an online oath to Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi (Jakarta Post, June 14, 2014). However, support to the Islamic State has not been uncontested. Abu Bakar Bashir pledged allegiance to the organization from prison, but the decision split JAT (Kompas, July 14, 2014). Bashir’s own sons and top aides refused to support the Islamic State and were expelled, going on to form a new group, Jemaah Ansharusy Syariah (JAS – Group of Supporters of Shari’a). Meanwhile JI, which has been quietly redeveloping its military capacity, has sided with Jabhat al-Nusra against the Islamic State (Tempo, January 5).

The Islamic State has also gained support from Santoso, the most infamous Indonesian terrorist currently at large. Santoso is a former JI member who became head of JAT’s Central Sulawesi affiliate in 2010 (IPAC [Jakarta], April 15). By late 2012, he formed a coalition of local jihadist groups in Poso, called Mujahidin Indonesia Timur (MIT), that repeatedly ambushed and killed police officers. His network maintains ties to jihadists elsewhere in Indonesia, as well as in Malaysia and the Philippines (Janes Terrorism & Insurgency Centre (JITC), February 7, 2013). Escaping multiple raids and manhunts, Santoso has since become Indonesia’s most wanted jihadist.

Santoso has released videos taunting police, described himself as “the Abu Musab al-Zarqawi of Indonesia,” and was one of the first Indonesian jihadists to pledge allegiance to IS (IPAC [Jakarta], April 15). His group has not been officially recognized by the Islamic State, but it has received support from jihadists abroad. For instance, on September 2014, police arrested four Uyghurs who had entered Indonesia with fake passports and tried to join Santoso’s militia (Jakarta Post, July 13). They were suspected of having been part of a group that attacked a train station in Kunming in southwestern China (Jakarta Post, February 10).

Another concern has been of Islamic State-connected or -inspired bombings within Indonesia. On February 23, 2015, a small chlorine bomb exploded in a mall on the outskirts of Jakarta, but no one was harmed (Kompas, February 26). Police blamed the attack on Syria returnees, although no suspects have been named (Jakarta Globe, July 11). In July, another mall bombing occurred, which the police linked to the Islamic State’s call for attacks during Ramadan (Kompas, July 11). On August 12, 2015, Indonesian police arrested three men who were allegedly planning an attack to coincide with Independence Day celebrations (Kompas, August 14). The planned attack apparently intended to target police as well as several places of worship in Central Java (Kompas, August 14). Police confiscated 21 improvised explosives and Islamic State-related items from the suspects’ homes (Kompas, August 13). The three men reportedly received funding from an Indonesian currently in Syria (Kompas, August 14). As most jihadist attacks in Indonesia since 2010 had been small-scale shootings, these recent plots suggest a potential return to mass-casualty bombings.

Future Prospects

The outlook for Indonesian counter-terrorism is not bleak. The estimated numbers involved in the Syria-Iraq mobilization are relatively small, and many Middle Eastern, North African and Western countries have produced more foreign fighters, both in absolute terms and relative to the size of their Muslim populations. The communal conflicts in Maluku and Sulawesi, in which jihadist groups thrived, ended over a decade ago and show no signs of restarting. Moreover, Indonesia has developed formidable counter-terrorist capabilities over the past decade.

However, while Indonesia’s jihadist networks are not large or widespread, they have proven persistent. Detachment 88 and other counter-terrorism bodies have had tactical successes, but the government has been less successful in its non-coercive effort to undermine support for jihadism. At first, Indonesia’s Countering Violent Extremism (CVE) approach involved ad-hoc initiatives by police, prison authorities and NGOs. However, in 2010, the military was put in charge of CVE, but has so far not proven adept at it (IPAC [Jakarta], June 30, 2014).

Detachment 88’s often-questionable shootings of suspects have also created new grievances for jihadists to use as a rallying cry, potentially undermining CVE attempts (ABC, February 8, 2013). A further issue is increased competition between the military and police. The military plays little substantial role in counter-terrorism, but has recently used the police’s failure to catch Santoso to push for greater involvement; the military also has a receptive ear in the new government of President Joko Widodo (Jokowi) (IPAC [Jakarta], May 25). These factors complicate Indonesia’s counter-terrorism efforts.

The resilience of Indonesia’s jihadist networks meanwhile provides opportunities for the Islamic State. The threat Indonesia faced in the early 2000s resulted in part from local extremist groups becoming involved in the 1980s foreign fighter mobilization to Afghanistan. The current mobilization to Syria and Iraq, if not handled well, could result in a similar escalation of the terrorist threat.

Present Bush today announced that the U.S. Treasury is designating five Hamas related charities and six senior Hamas leaders as Specially Designated Global Terrorists (SDGTs), freezing any assets in the U.S. and prohibiting transactions with U.S. nationals. �By claiming responsibility for the despicable act of terror on August 19, Hamas has reaffirmed that it is a terrorist organization committed to violence against Israelis and to undermining progress toward peace between Israel and the Palestinian people,� President Bush stated.

�Hamas� leaders and those who provide their funding again have the blood of innocents on their hands,� U.S. Treasury Secretary John Snow stated. �Empty words cannot wash them clean. As they resist the road map for peace, Hamas is devastating the dreams of the Palestinian people for freedom, prosperity, and an independent state.�

The United States will continue to work with our allies to encourage the recognition of Hamas as a terrorist organization and to shut down their sources of funding and support.

The following individuals are designated as SDGTs by today�s action:

Sheik Ahmed Yassin, the leader of Hamas in Gaza.
Imad Khalil Al-Alami, a member of the Hamas Political Bureau in Damascus, Syria.
Usama Hamdan, a senior Hamas leader in Lebanon.
Khalid Mishaal, head of the Hamas Political Bureau and Executive Committee in Damascus, Syria.
Musa Abu Marzouk, Deputy Chief of the Political Bureau in Syria.
Abdel Aziz Rantisi, a Hamas leader in Gaza reporting to Sheik Yassin.

The following charities that provide support to Hamas and form part of its funding network in Europe are designated as well:

Commite de Bienfaisance et de Secours aux Palestiniens (CBSP), of France.
The Association de Secours Palestinien (ASP), of Switzerland. (An organization related to CBSP)
The Palestinian Relief and Development Fund, or Interpal, headquartered in the United Kingdom.
The Palestinian Association in Austria, PVOE.
The Sanabil Association for Relief and Development, based in Lebanon .

Today�s action follows several actions taken against Hamas previously, including the designation of several entities that formed part of the Hamas network such as Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development and the Al Aqsa Foundation, key sources of financial support for Hamas.

ATTACHED: Fact Sheet

HAMAS

HAMAS is a terrorist organization that has intentionally killed hundreds of innocent civilians and continues to kill and maim with the aim of terrorizing a civilian population. HAMAS was formed in 1987 as an outgrowth of the Palestinian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood. HAMAS activists have conducted many attacks � including large-scale suicide bombings � against Israeli citizens and military targets. In the early 1990s, they also targeted U.S. citizens, suspected Palestinian collaborators and Fatah rivals.

During 2002, more than 370 persons � including 10 US citizens � were killed in Israel, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip by acts of terrorism. HAMAS was responsible for carrying out more than 50 of these attacks, including shootings, suicide bombings, and standoff mortar-and-rocket attacks against civilian and military targets. The group was responsible for the most deadly Palestinian terrorist attack of the year � the suicide bombings of a Passover gathering at a Netanya hotel that killed 29 Israelis, including one dual US-Israeli citizen. HAMAS's bombing of a cafeteria on the Hebrew University campus, which killed nine, including five US citizens, demonstrated its willingness to stage operations in areas frequented by students and tourists, including US citizens.

In addition, HAMAS's rejectionist policies and terrorist actions are aimed at derailing the peace process in the Middle East. On April 30, 2003, the U.S. government released the roadmap for peace between Israel and the Palestinians, which constitutes a crucial step in international efforts to actively support movement towards peace in the region. HAMAS, however, has since the mid-90s purposefully worked against all regional peace efforts by engaging in suicide attacks and other acts of the most violent type of terrorism. On June 8 and June 11 HAMAS took credit for attacks against Israelis. The organization also took credit for four suicide bombings in a 24-hour period during the weekend preceding May 20th.

On June 29th, HAMAS and two other designated terrorist groups announced a cease-fire. On August 19th, a suicide bomber detonated his bomb in the back of a double-length city bus near the border between east and west Jerusalem. According to a CNN report, HAMAS said that it was committed to the cease-fire, but also claimed responsibility, stating that �the man was a member of its military wing, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades, and the attack came in revenge for the killing of two of its members.� As noted by the Human Rights Watch, �the Hamas leadership has pursued attacks against civilians as a conscious policy. A group that pursues multiple, intentional attacks against civilians as a matter of policy is responsible for crimes against humanity.� Erased in a Moment: Suicide Bombing Attacks Against Israeli Civilians at 67 (October 2002).

Under Executive Order 13224, the United States government may block the assets of HAMAS (which it has done) and the assets of individuals and entities owned or controlled by; acting for or on behalf of; or providing support, financial or otherwise, to designated terrorists and terrorist organizations. HAMAS has been designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization (66 Fed. Reg. 51088) and as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT) under Executive Order 13224, ""Blocking Property and Prohibiting Transactions with Persons who Commit, or Support Terrorism.�

Yassin is the head of HAMAS in Gaza. He maintains a direct line of communication with other HAMAS leaders on coordination of HAMAS's military activities and openly admits that there is no distinguishing the political and military wings of Hamas. Yassin

also conveys messages about operational planning to other Palestinian terrorist organizations.

Surrounding Y

assin is an entourage of personal ""bodyguards,"" including many implicated in providing information and supplies to fugitives, recruiting personnel to undertake military operations, planning terrorist cells, attacking settlements, and manufacturing weapons and explosives.

I

mad Khalil AL-ALAMI

Imad al-Alami is a member of HAMAS's Political Bureau, located in Damascus, Syria and a military operations leader. As part of HAMAS's external leadership, he is part of the most effective and powerful wing of HAMAS because it controls the West Bank and prison branches of HAMAS and has gained total financial control.

Al-Alami has had oversight responsibility for the military wing of HAMAS within the Palestinian territories. As a HAMAS military leader, al-Alami directs sending personnel and funding to the West Bank and Gaza.

U

sama HAMDAN

Hamdan, a senior HAMAS official based in Lebanon, maintains contact with representatives with other terrorist organizations with the purpose of strengthening the ties between these organizations in order to strengthen an international Islamic Jihad. He has worked with other HAMAS and Hizballah leaders on initiatives to develop and activate the military network inside the Palestinian territories in support of the current intifada, including the movement of weapons, explosives and personnel to the West Bank and Gaza for HAMAS fighters.

Funds transferred from charitable donations to HAMAS for distribution to the families of Palestinian �martyrs� have been transferred to the bank account of Hamdan and used to support HAMAS military operations in Israel.

Khalid MISHAAL

Mishaal is the chief of HAMAS's Political Bureau in Damascus, Syria and heads HAMAS's Executive Committee and Special Office. Cells in the military wing based in the West Bank that are under Mishaal's control have been implicated in efforts by HAMAS to plan large attacks that would undermine the ""road map"" peace plan.

Mishaal has been responsible for supervising assassination operations, bombings and the killing of Israeli settlers. To execute HAMAS military activities, Mishaal maintains a direct link to Gaza-based HAMAS leader, Abdel Aziz Rantisi (see below). He also provides instructions to other parts of the HAMAS military wing.

Funds transferred from charitable donations to HAMAS for distribution to the families of Palestinian martyrs have been transferred to the bank account of Mishaal and used to support HAMAS military operations in Israel.

Musa Abu MARZOUK

Musa Abu Marzouk is the Deputy Chief of HAMAS's Political Bureau based in Damascus, Syria. His activities include directing and coordinating terrorist acts by HAMAS against soldiers and civilians in Israel and the West Bank and Gaza. Marzouk maintains relationships with other terrorist organizations.

The Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development, designated as an SDGT under EO 13224 in December 2001 based on its support of HAMAS, received start-up funding and instructions from Marzouk. Marzouk is implicated in receiving financing for HAMAS terrorist attacks, funds that have been used to mobilize military activity inside Israel and the West Bank/Gaza.

Abdel Aziz RANTISI

Rantisi is part of the HAMAS leadership in Gaza, operating directly under HAMAS Leader Shaykh Yassin (see above) with whom he maintains a direct line of communication for the coordination of military operations. Mishaal (see above) has also issued orders for HAMAS terrorist activities through R

HAMAS Fundraising

HAMAS raises tens of millions or dollars per year throughout the world using charitable fundraising as cover. While HAMAS may provide money for legitimate charitable work, this work is a primary recruiting tool for the organization's militant causes. HAMAS relies on donations from Palestinian expatriates around the world and private benefactors located in moderate Arab states, Western Europe and North America. HAMAS uses a web of charities to facilitate funding and to funnel money. Charitable donations to non-governmental organizations are commingled, moved between charities in ways that hide the money trail, and then often diverted or siphoned to support terrorism.

The funds pouring into HAMAS coffers directly undermine the Middle East peace process. These funds allow the group to continue to foment violence, strengthen its terrorist infrastructure, and undermine responsible leadership.

The political leadership of HAMAS directs its terrorist networks just as they oversee their other activities. HAMAS leader Yassin confirms this relationship, stating to al-Sharq al-Awsat on August 12, 2002: ""When we make decisions on the political level and convey them to the military wing, it abides by it normally.� The intensity of this relationship is reflected in Yassin's words quoted by Reuters on May 12, 1998:

We can not separate the wing from the body. If we do so, the body will not be able to fly. HAMAS is one body.

A report issued by Human Rights Watch has also noted the unified nature of HAMAS:

In the case of Hamas, there is abundant evidence that the military wing is accountable to a political steering committee . . . . Yassin himself, as well as Salah Shehadah, the late founder and commander of the �Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades, have confirmed in public remarks that the military wing implements policies that are set by the political wing.� Erased in a Moment: Suicide Bombing Attacks Against Israeli Civilians at 63 (October 2002).

Fundraising may involve community solicitation in the United States, Canada, Europe and the Middle East or solicitations directly to wealthy donors. While some donors may be aware of the intended use of their donations, too many innocent donors who intend for their money to be used to provide humanitarian services here or abroad, are unwittingly funding acts of violence when these funds are diverted to terrorist causes.

HAMAS fundraising directly undermines Prime Minister Mahmud Abbas's ability to clamp down on this terrorist organization. One of the obstacles and threats to establishing a meaningful dialogue toward peace comes from terrorist groups such as HAMAS, which view peace discussions as inimical to their interests and are intent on undermining the multilateral work on the roadmap by fomenting violence. In order to support momentum towards peace, to strengthen the ability of the new Palestinian leadership to take the actions it must take against HAMAS, the assets of groups like HAMAS must be frozen, as well as the assets of organizations raising funds for such terrorist groups.

E.O. 13224 provides a means to disrupt the financial-support network funding terrorist attacks committed by HAMAS. Under this Order, the United States government may block the assets of HAMAS (which it has done) and the assets of individuals and entities owned or controlled by; acting for or on behalf of; or providing support, financial or otherwise, to designated terrorists and terrorist organizations. HAMAS has been designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization (66 Fed. Reg. 51088) and as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT) under Executive Order 13224, ""Blocking Property and Prohibiting Transactions with Persons who Commit, or Support Terrorism.�

The United States government has credible evidence that the following five organizations are part of a web of charities raising funds on behalf of HAMAS and using humanitarians purposes as a cover for acts that support HAMAS. Funds are generated by, and flow through, these organizations on behalf of HAMAS.

CBSP and ASP are primary fundraisers for HAMAS in France and Switzerland, respectively. Founded in France in the late 80s/early 90s, CBSP acts in collaboration with more than a dozen humanitarian organizations based in different towns in the West Bank and Gaza and in Palestinian refugee camps in Jordan and Lebanon.

Interpal, headquartered in the UK, has been a principal charity utilized to hide the flow of money to HAMAS. Reporting indicates it is the conduit through which money flows to HAMAS from other charities, e.g., the Al Aqsa Foundation (designated under EO 13224 on May 29th) and oversees the activities of other charities. For example, the Sanabil Association for Relief and Development (designated as part of this tranche), represents Interpal in Lebanon. Reporting indicates that Interpal is the fundraising coordinator of HAMAS. This role is of the type that includes supervising activities of charities, developing new charities in targeted areas, instructing how funds should be transferred from one charity to another, and even determining public relations policy.

PVOE is controlled by the leader of HAMAS in Austria. The money is targeted to support members of HAMAS and is funneled through other charities in Lebanon, the West Bank and Gaza or other areas of the Middle East in order to ensure the transfer of funds is undetected and reaches its intended recipients. PVOE is part of the HAMAS net work of charitable organizations that includes the Al Aqsa Foundation.

The Sanabil Association for Relief and Development (Sanabil), based in Sidon, Lebanon, receives large quantities of funds raised by major HAMAS-affiliated charities in Europe and the Middle East and, in turn, provides funding to HAMAS. For example, Sanabil has received funding from the Al Aqsa Foundation (designated as an SDGT under EO 13224 in May 2003); the Holy Land Foundation for Relief and Development (designated as an SDGT under EO 13224 in December 2001), and Interpal (designated as an SDGT under EO 13224 as part of this tranche). HAMAS recruits permanent members from the religious and the poor by extending charity to them from organizations such as S

anabil.

At the request of a HAMAS political leader, Sanabil began opening offices in all of the Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon in August of 2001 in order to increase the foundation's role inside the camps. After starting by providing basic necessities the charity eventually began asking poor families within the camps to fill out application forms, particularly those who had worked with the Islamic Movement (Al-Haraka al-Islamiyya) and HAMAS. As a result of these efforts, S

anabil has increased its scope of influence within the camps.",

MIAMI (Reuters) - The brother of jailed Colombian drug kingpin Diego Montoya, head of the Norte del Valle cartel, pleaded guilty on Friday to charges of conspiracy to import cocaine and obstruction of justice, U.S. prosecutors said.

Eugenio Montoya Sanchez was a high-ranking member of the cartel and had primary responsibility for managing its finances, according to U.S. authorities.

He was arrested by Colombian authorities in January 2007 following a shootout and extradited to Florida last June.

U.S. prosecutors said the cartel often kept up to $20 million in cash from drug sales in stash houses maintained and overseen by Montoya Sanchez.

As the cartel’s money manager, he used drug proceeds to fund cocaine labs, pay employees including lab workers, drug couriers and security personnel, and invest in real estate and other businesses. In 2003, his role expanded to coordinating cocaine shipments, they said.

Diego Montoya, known as Don Diego or the Boss of Bosses, in Colombia’s underworld, was extradited to Florida last month and is awaiting trial. He helped found the Norte del Valle cartel and appeared next to Osama bin Laden on the FBI’s “Ten Most Wanted” list.

Sentencing for Eugenio Montoya Sanchez in Miami was scheduled for April 3.

He was the third member of the family convicted in the case. His brother Juan Carlos Montoya Sanchez and cousin Carlos Felipe Toro Sanchez both pleaded guilty to drug conspiracy charges in 2005 and were sentenced to 21 and 19 years in prison respectively.",pleaded guilty

A Houston tech executive was charged on Thursday with hiding $2 billion in income from the Internal Revenue Service in what federal prosecutors called the largest tax evasion case in U.S. history.

Prosecutors said the executive, Robert T. Brockman, had used a web of entities based in Bermuda and Nevis, as well as secret bank accounts in Bermuda and Switzerland, to hide income from the I.R.S. that he had earned on private equity investments over 20 years.

A 39-count federal indictment handed up by a grand jury in San Francisco detailed a complex scheme involving backdated records and encrypted communications with code names like “King,” “Bonefish” and “Snapper” as well as “the house,” for the I.R.S.

The indictment said that Mr. Brockman, the chief executive of Reynolds and Reynolds, an Ohio company that makes management software for auto dealerships, used $30 million in income that he had hidden from taxation to buy properties named Mountain Queen and Frying Pan Canyon Ranch in Colorado and had spent an additional $29 million in unreported income on a yacht named Turmoil.","paywall, but scrapeable"

SINGAPORE: The founder of Singapore oil trading company Hin Leong was charged in court on Friday (Sep 25) with abetment of forgery for the purpose of cheating, the police said.

Lim Oon Kuin, 78, now faces two counts of abetment of forgery, after the first charge on Aug 14.

The charge on Friday accuses Lim of instigating Hin Leong contracts executive Freddy Tan Jie Ren to forge an email purportedly sent by Hin Leong Trading to China Aviation Oil (Singapore) on Feb 26 in relation to a sale transaction of Gasoil 10PPM sulphur.

“This email, along with the Inter-Tank Transfer certificate mentioned in the first charge, was submitted to a financial institution to secure more than US$56 million (S$77 million) in trade financing,” police said in a news release.

If convicted, Lim could face up to 10 years in jail and a fine for each charge.

Investigations are ongoing into the other offences allegedly committed by Lim, the police added.

Hin Leong, one of Singapore’s largest independent oil traders, is now struggling to repay debts of US$3.85 billion.

Police confirmed in April that they were investigating Hin Leong, after the firm filed for bankruptcy protection amid a revelation from its founder that it had failed to disclose hundreds of millions in losses over several years.

Lim had directed the company to hide nearly US$800 million in losses from speculating oil futures over the years.

An affidavit signed by Lim cited the collapse in global oil prices – brought about by the COVID-19 outbreak and a price war among the oil majors – and a lack of hedging policies as some of the factors behind the company’s financial distress.

The affidavit, which said Mr Lim was resigning immediately as director of the family-held company, did not specify over how many years the losses were incurred.

In May, Singaporean shipping firm Ocean Tankers, a unit of Hin Leong, applied to be placed under the management of a court-appointed supervisor.

A report filed in June in the High Court later found that the firm had obtained financing from various banks for cargoes of oil that did not exist, complicating the competing claims of ownership.",charged

FORT WORTH (CBSDFW.COM) – A federal jury convicted Caleb Deason, 34, Wednesday on an indictment charging one count each of wire fraud and money laundering. It took two days in a trial before U.S. District Judge John McBryde, for the jury to convict the Fort Worth resident. Following the verdict, Judge McBryde remanded Deason into custody.

The government presented evidence at trial that Deason owned and operated CD Financial, a financial services business in Fort Worth. Deason was an agent of Transamerica Life Insurance Company from November 2006 through May 2012. In October 2011, Deason sold an individual a Transamerica policy with a death benefit of $1 million.

In January 2012, the insured died unexpectedly. Transamerica conducted extensive due diligence before agreeing to pay the policy’s death benefit to the insured’s wife. However, Deason fraudulently changed the bank account and routing information and forged the beneficiary’s signature on a Transamerica wire request form in order to divert the proceeds from the life insurance policy to his own personal use. He bought a 2010 Range Rover with the money, according to court records.

Deason faces a maximum statutory penalty of 20 years in federal prison on the wire fraud conviction and 10 years on the money laundering conviction. Each count of conviction also carries a fine of up to $250,000. The 2010 Range Rover was administratively forfeited by the U.S. Secret Service.

Sentencing for Deason was set for April 4, 2014.

TMML2024035005515,Elliot Morley,"Alert ID: TMML2024035005515
Morley, a former Labour environment minister, pleaded guilty last month to claiming more than £30,000 in bogus mortgage payments.

He entered two guilty pleas for false accounting relating to his home in Winterton, near Scunthorpe, North Lincolnshire, between 2004 and 2007.

Morley was sentenced at London's Southwark Crown Court.

A Labour Party spokesman said: ""Elliot Morley had already been suspended from the Labour Party and following his custodial sentence he has now been excluded from the party.""

Morley, who appeared flushed throughout the hearing, showed no emotion as the sentence was delivered.

The former Labour MP, the most high profile of a string of convictions since the expenses revelations rocked Westminster, pocketed £30,428 by claiming for a phantom mortgage and inflating the amount he was previously paying.

In total, he claimed £16,800 on a bogus mortgage and £15,200 after inflating the amount he was previously paying - for which he should have been entitled to only £1,572.

Passing sentence, Mr Justice Saunders said Morley was guilty of ""blatant dishonesty"" and had ""thrown away his good name and character.""

He said: ""I am satisfied from the nature of the mortgage transactions and the correspondence that the excessive claims were made deliberately and are not explicable even in part by oversight.""

The prosecution overshadows a political career lasting more than 20 years.

As MP for Scunthorpe since 1987, former teacher Morley was one of Labour's most prominent voices on agricultural issues and the environment.

He was party spokesman on rural affairs and animal welfare from 1989 until the 1997 election victory, and served under Tony Blair as environment minister from 2003 to 2006.

But during that time he was claiming thousands of pounds more than any of the other MPs convicted.

Peter Wright QC, prosecuting, told the court said Morley had ""engaged in the wholesale abuse of the expenses system"".

The packed courtroom was told that between May 2004 and November 2007, Morley claimed significantly more than the value of his mortgage on his second home.

Despite paying off the mortgage of the property in 2006, he continued to claim £800 a month in fraudulent payments.

Between May 2004 and February 2006, he submitted 19 claims for ""excessive mortgage payments"" to which he was not entitled, worth £15,200.

Between March 2006 and November 2007 he submitted 21 second-home allowance forms totaling £16,800 for payments on a mortgage that did not exist.

Mr Justice Saunders said: ""The continuation of the claim for £800 a month after the mortgage had been redeemed can properly be described as blatant dishonesty.""

He added: ""The results of this case are tragic for the defendant and his family.

""He has thrown away his good name and good character.""

The court heard that under parliamentary expenses rules, Morley was entitled to claim only the interest element of mortgage payments on his second home.

This amount varied from £52 per month in 2004 to just £5.85 in February 2006, but throughout this period, Morley continued to claim £800 per month.

After receiving a letter from the Parliamentary fees office, Morley explained his behaviour as an ""embarrassing and inadvertent oversight"".

Jim Sturman QC, mitigating, said that once challenged Morley had paid back the full amount owed immediately.

He said: ""This is a tragic end to a lifetime of public service. He has done an enormous amount of good, often for no pay.""

He added: ""He's made a grotesque error of judgment

Mr Justice Saunders explained that Morley avoided a longer jail sentence despite claiming more money than other MPs convicted over the expenses scandal because of the lack of sophistication of his fraud.

He told the court: ""While this defendant is charged with obtaining more money than any other MP and over a long period, the degree of sophistication involved in carrying out the fraud was less than in some other cases.""

Matthew Sinclair, director of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: ""Morley's jail sentence is justice for taxpayers who he cheated and stole from.

""The damage done by the MPs' expenses scandal is still being repaired and it will take time to restore the public's trust in the system, but this is another step down that road.",mortgage fraud

Indonesia-born Hambali has been dubbed by the US Central Intelligence Agency the ""Osama Bin Laden"" of South East Asia.

He is believed to have been the operations chief for the shadowy militant group Jemaah Islamiah (JI), and has been named as a key suspect in a string of bombings across the region.

The Islamic scholar, whose real name is Riduan Isamuddin, is wanted by Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and the Philippines in connection with a series of bomb attacks.

He is also accused of arranging a meeting between two of the 11 September hijackers with other al-Qaeda figures in Malaysia in January 2000, and of being behind other plots to blow up Western targets in the region.

And he is further accused of connections with the suspects accused of bombing the USS Cole in Yemen in October 2000.

He has faced lengthy interrogation by the US following his arrest, in central Thailand in 2003. He has now been sent to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

JI is blamed for several attacks across South East Asia, including the 2002 Bali bombing, which killed 202 people, and the 2003 attack on the Marriott hotel in Jakarta, which killed 12.

Analysts say JI wants to establish an Islamic state across Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore and parts of the Philippines.

Indonesia's civilian intelligence service has linked Hambali specifically with the 2002 Bali attack.

He is thought to have been the major brains behind the operation, as well as the financial conduit.

Indonesia's Defence Minister, Matori Abdul Djalil, has said that Hambali was deputy to Abu Bakar Ba'asyir, JI's alleged leader.

Abu Bakar Ba'asyir was jailed in 2005 after he was found guilty of conspiracy in connection with the 2002 Bali attacks. He denies any links with JI.

Radical roots

Hambali was born in West Java in 1966, one of 13 children in a poor family.

As a teenager he became involved in a network of local groups known broadly as Jemaah Islamiah, which literally translates as ""Islamic community"". One of the men allegedly running the network was Abu Bakar Ba'asyir.

Hambali became involved in radical Islam as a reaction against the religious repression of the Suharto regime throughout the 1970s and 1980s. In 1985, when Hambali was aged 19, he sought exile in Malaysia, along with Mr Ba'asyir and other followers.

From there he travelled to Afghanistan in 1988 to fight as a Mujahideen guerrilla against Soviet occupation.

He returned to Malaysia in 1990, where he is believed to have travelled the country recruiting young Muslims to join a jihad (holy war) with the eventual aim of setting up a pan-Asian Islamic state.

Back in Indonesia, Suharto was overthrown in 1998, and Hambali is believed to have returned there in October 2000 to recruit more supporters.

On Christmas Eve that year, a series of bombs exploded almost simultaneously in nine Indonesian cities, many of them in churches. Eighteen people were killed.

A series of suspects have named Hambali - who returned to Malaysia a few days before the attacks - as the mastermind for the bombings.

A few days after the Indonesian bombs, 22 people were killed in a series of simultaneous bombs in the Philippine capital Manila. Philippine police say they have evidence that Hambali funded the attacks.

Philippine prosecutors have charged Hambali in absentia with involvement in a plot to smuggle explosives from the Philippines to Singapore in 2000, for an attack on US and Israeli targets, which was foiled.",wanted for bomb attacks

A U.S. Customs and Border Patrol agent was performing a routine check at Miami International Airport on Monday when he came across one of the flight attendants, identified as Carlos Alberto Munoz-Moyano.

According to an arrest report obtained by The Associated Press, Munoz-Moyano, 40, had arrived on a flight from Chile when he told the agent he only had $100 cash on him but the agent found $9,000. It was not immediately clear if the money was on him or in his luggage.

Three other women traveling with Munoz-Moyano were also arrested after reportedly telling federal agents they were smuggling the cash on behalf of someone else. It is unclear if the suspects were working on the flight when it arrived in Miami.

The arrest report stated that 55-year-old Maria Del Pilar Roman-Strick had $7,300 and 48-year-old Maria Wilson-Ossandon had $6,371.

Maria Pasten-Cuzmar also was arrested with no cash on her, but agents say the other three named her as the director of the illicit operation, the Miami Herald reported.

A spokesperson for American Airlines told Fox News on Wednesday: “We take this matter seriously and are cooperating with law enforcement throughout their investigation.”

He also confirmed that they were all Chilean citizens and that the state would be handling the case after the U.S. attorney declined the case.

TMML2024036116522,Steve Wynn,"Alert ID: TMML2024036116522
Former workers for the Las Vegas billionaire and casino-owner have been revealing what it was like to work for Steve Wynn.

Many have recalled how the man had a fiery temper during meetings with staff and how he would cast an intimidating figure often shouting and banging his fists on the table to get his point across.

When faced with threats from staff he would simply laugh in their faces by declaring himself to be 'the most powerful man in Nevada.'

It was not a declaration that anyone in the room would dare question.

The billionaire casino mogul resigned last Tuesday less than two weeks after the Wall Street Journal reported that a number of women said Wynn harassed or assaulted them and that one case led to a $7.5 million settlement, although he denies the allegations.

Wynn never cared about making friends with his workers and according to tales over the years wouldn't think twice about screwing them over when it came to their wages in order to keep more money in the company.

During one meeting with 15 card dealers at the Wynn Las Vegas, staff were unhappy about a new policy that demanded they share their tips with their supervisors who already earned $100,000-a-year.

For many, it would mean making around $15-$20,000 less in take home pay. Dealers said the change would cost them as much as 20% of their pay.

When the workers said they would file a complaint against him with the National Labor Relations Board, Wynn theatened to fire them if they unionized.

He shouted and belittled them while slamming his fists onto the table reminding them that he was 'the most powerful man in Nevada.'

The dealers argued that if Wynn wanted to give supervisors a raise, he should reach into his own pocket.

When Wynn walked into the room during the 2006 meeting Wynn acknowledged his workers upset at the new shared tipping policy but told them there was nothing they could do to change it.

He advised them against starting a union and referred to other Vegas businesses where employees voted to unionize or had gone on strike and then subsequently lost their jobs.

'If you join a union, I can by law replace all 600 of you,' dealer Tynisia Boone recalled Wynn saying. 'If you picket you will automatically be terminated because those are my sidewalks.'

Even with Wynn now having left the company he founded, many employees remain uncomfortable about speaking out about the man such is his power and influence across Sin City.

According to CNN, one lawyer described Wynn as a man who was not afraid to 'get rid of a fly by firing a shotgun.'

Single-mother Cynthia Fields who was in the 2006 card dealers meeting and sitting right next to Wynn explained to him that she had specifically chosen to work at his casino because it paid better than others in the city.

'If I had known I was going to come here and I was going to have money taken away for nothing I had done,' Fields told Wynn, 'I possibly would not have made that change.'

She said the new policy would result in around $20,000 less pay a year which would be 'burden' for her.

Wynn is alleged to have replied, 'If $15,000 to $20,000 a year makes that big of a difference in your life, then you're doing something wrong.'

Wynn then became irate. Fields said: 'he was leaning over me' so intently that 'I could feel the spit on my face from his mouth.'

Another dealer, Tynisia Boone confirmed what Fields had seen.

'Wynn got up and started screaming and then started getting up and down and slamming his hand and fist on the table saying he was ""'the most powerful man in Nevada.''' According to Boone.

When a third dealer, Tom Golly then declared Wynn's attempt to take tips as being 'illegal,' he simply said that 'his name was on the building and he can do anything he wants to do.'

In testimony before a Labor Relations Board judge, Wynn didn't remember anything of how he had behaved although he did admit to banging his fist on the table and putting it down to the empathy he felt for his workers.

Elsewhere on the gaming floor, eleven cocktail waitresses who worked for Wynn at The Mirage sued him in 1997 claiming they were discriminated against because of their weight and age.

Six years later, The Mirage settled the waitresses' claims, but the abuse of female staff appears frequently in recent allegations against Wynn.

Charlotte Arrowsmith who lead the complaint on behalf of the cocktail waitresses said she would often be mocked and was called the 'blue whale'.

In an interview with CNN she wept with joy at the news that Wynn resigned. 'Oh, hallelujah, thank you Lord! Something positive can come from this,' she said. 'After all that he put us through, he needs to be humiliated.'

The Wall Street Journal spoke with 150 people who currently work for Wynn or have in the past, and a number of the women who no longer work at one of the billionaire businessman's properties were incredibly forthcoming in describing the lengths they would allegedly go to in order to avoid being alone with their boss.

Some scheduled fake appointments to make sure they would not be chosen to give Wynn spa treatments, while others went so far as to hide in bathrooms when he came into the salon.

One worker said that she was coerced into performing a sex act on Wynn, with her hand at the end of his massages, adding that Wynn asked at one point if she could use her mouth rather than rubbing his penis to climax when they were done with the session.

That woman refused, but in 2005 another employee was not able to decline Wynn's advances when he ordered her to disrobe and lie on a table so they could have sex.

She reported Wynn and received a $7.5 million settlement, which was revealed by Wynn's ex-wife Elaine in court papers.

It was that court filing which led to the Journal's investigation.

At the end of every session, the woman said that Wynn paid her $1,000 in cash

'I did it willingly, because I felt I had to,' she told the paper. 'I didn't really want to. I was afraid for my job.'

Wynn gave a statement to the Journal after their investigation: 'The idea that I ever assaulted any woman is preposterous. We find ourselves in a world where people can make allegations, regardless of the truth, and a person is left with the choice of weathering the insulting publicity or engaging in multiyear lawsuits. It is deplorable for anyone to find themselves in this situation.'

There are countless other stories concerning Wynn howeverWynn Resorts spokesman Michael Weaver has declined to comment on the allegations made by any of the Wynn employees .

In a tale from 2005 that has been seen by CNN details how a woman who worked as a cleaning crew manager for Wynn walked into a Las Vegas police station after she claims Wynn assaulted her.

Raquel Houston was summoned by Wynn to the Lure Nightclub, a lounge at one of the Wynn Resorts, 'at the speed of light.'

After being ordered to the venue, crews were working buffer machines to clean marble at the club.

'He turns around to me and then he starts yelling at me and grabbing me tight and pulling on me,' Houston told CNN. 'I was shocked. I couldn't believe that he was doing this.'

'He was going, ""What is this crap? What is going on here? Who gave you authorization?'""

'I was trying to answer his question,' Houston said. 'I told him, ""This is the marble crew that does your floors every night.""' I told him, '""Please stop grabbing me. Stop, let me go.""'

Houston sued Wynn in civil court describing how he would 'pull her', 'tightened his grip on her arm' and 'continued to drag her,' the suit said.

Her arm was injured in the incident, she alleged, and she had to get medical treatment, including therapy.

She sued Wynn for $10,000 each for medical costs, lost wages, emotional distress and other compensation.

Wynn denied the allegations and hired lawyers in New York and Vegas for $140,000.

After a four year legal battle, the arbitrator ruled in favor of Wynn, saying Houston failed to provide evidence and meet the burden of proof.

Houston ended up having to file for bankruptcy after Wynn demanded to be reimbursed $49,000 in costs.

After the case, she lost her job and is now finding it impossible to get a job elsewhere at other Vegas casinos all because she challenged Wynn.

'It wasn't about money,' her lawyer told CNN. 'To my feeling, it was just vindictive.

'I think he wanted to send a message to anybody that might want to challenge Wynn Resorts or Steve Wynn: It won't end well for you.'",

One of Italy’s most dangerous wanted criminals has been arrested by police in Naples as part of a major crackdown on mafia activity across the country.

Organised crime boss Mario Riccio, 23, has been on the run since 2011 and faces a 16-year jail sentence for drug trafficking offences.

Police said Riccio, nicknamed Mariano, was the youngest fugitive on a list of around 100 considered the most wanted across Italy.

He is believed to be the head of the Amato-Pagato branch of the Camorra mafia clan. Based in Naples, Camorra is one of the most powerful Italian crime networks with influence extending to Rome and as far north as Florence, according to BBC News.

Investigations and Special Reports Editor
Former Police Commissioner-General Augustine Chihuri is suspected of diverting US$32 million of public funds into family companies and buying a large swathe of property, which the State now wants frozen pending the final outcome of possible criminal cases and civil suits.

During his 25 years at the helm of the police, Chihuri and his family acquired a lot of property and other assets.

So yesterday Prosecutor-General Mr Kumbirai Hodzi filed an application at the High Court seeking an order compelling Chihuri to explain how he acquired his properties and he wants all the assets still in Zimbabwe frozen until investigations and resulting court actions are complete.

Chihuri, his wife Isobel Halima Khan Chihuri, daughter Samantha Hamadziripi Chihuri, and son Ethan Takudzwa Augustine Chihuri were listed as the respondents in the application along with relatives Aitken and Netsai Khan and six companies: Croxile Investments, Adamah Enterprises, Mastermedia (Pvt) Ltd, Mastaw Investments and Rash Marketing.

In an affidavit deposed by Mr Hodzi, Chihuri is under investigation for criminal abuse of office, money laundering, theft and fraud. He accuses Chihuri of establishing a “syndicated criminal mafia” meant to siphon public funds for his personal benefit and that of his cronies. This would have entailed externalisation of money and money laundering abroad, he said.

Mr Hodzi contends that Chihuri established the companies in connivance with his relatives for the alleged purposes of siphoning funds from the Zimbabwe Republic Police’s revolving fund held under CBZ Account number 0212050619002.

Isobel Chihuri, according to the State, is the managing director for Mastaw Investments, which received US$3 823 285 from ZRP General Headquarters after giving an allegedly fake business address.

Rewstand Enterprises received US$10 401 500 from ZRP despite using an allegedly fake address. Investigations by the police found a different company operating from that address, said Mr Hodzi.

Nodpack Investments (Pvt) Ltd of Bure Close in Strathaven, Harare, whose directorship includes Clever Nziramasanga and had Isobel Halim Chihuri as general manager, allegedly received US$5 766 252.31 from the police. But, said Mr Hodzi, this address was a residential property for a Mrs Marange who does not know Nodpack, raising strong suspicion that the address was fake.

Croxile Investments (Pvt) Ltd of 8 St Aubins Walk in Chisipite received US$1 892 040 from the police, with Vanessa Madalisto Banda listed as director and Isobel Chihuri as general manager. But the property owner is a Mr Matongo who does not know about Croxile.

ZRP also released US$10 575 732 to Adamah Enterprises Pvt Ltd of 29 Carsberg Avenue in Alexandra Park in Harare. Isobel Chihuri is also general manager of this company with Nelia Mafunga listed as director. But

investigations found this address belonged to another company called Brightcoast Construction owned by Clever Nziramasanga.

Mastermedia (Pvt) Ltd, according to the State, is owned by Isobel Khan Chihuri and it received US$1 073 038.08 from the ZRP Revolving Fund from January 5, 2016 to February 9, 2017.

Rash Marketing, which is owned by a CBZ employee called Shingirai Maponga and his spouse Sharon Maponga nee Tiyani, received US$764 370 from November 14, 2016 to December 12, 2016.

The companies won orders for the supply of goods and services without going to tender.

Besides the company dealings, the State is keen for Chihuri to explain his property holdings.

The State wants Chihuri to explain how he acquired 11 listed properties:

Seven residential stands at Police Heights on Gletwin Farm in north-east Harare;

571 Zengeza Township;

9 hectares at Fishhponds in Lomagundi district (Deed of Transfer 3177/90);

Stand 231 in Athlone in Greendale (Deed 1214/85) measuring 4 639 square metres; and

431 Quinnington in Borrowdale (5284/14) measuring 5 500 square metres.

Four vehicles are also listed under assets that need explanation. Two combine harvesters, six tractors, two planters, three motorbikes and a boom spray were found at Chihuri’s farms at Shamva and Darwendale.","money laundering, fraud, etc"

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has been rebuked by the U.S. Ethics Office after selling his stake in a film production company, which he’d promised to divest from, to his own wife, Louise Linton. Whoops!

The office said that, because of this, they won’t certify Mnuchin’s 2018 financial disclosure statement, according to a Thursday report in the New York Times. Mnuchin has promised to distance himself from the company, and won’t face any penalties for the sale.

From the Times:

Mr. Mnuchin in 2017 sold his stake in StormChaser Partners to his then-fiancée, Louise Linton, as part of a series of divestments before becoming Treasury secretary. Since they are now married, government ethics rules consider the asset to be owned by Mr. Mnuchin, potentially creating a conflict of interest for an official who has been negotiating for expanded access for the movie industry as part of trade talks with China. [...]

Mr. Mnuchin said last month at a Senate hearing that he was told by Treasury ethics officials that he was allowed to sell his stake in StormChaser to Ms. Linton, an actress and producer. However, the Office of Government Ethics was not made aware of that guidance and had not approved it.

Mnuchin isn’t the first Trump official to be scorned by the ethics office. Just last month, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross was also told that his disclosure statement couldn’t be certified because of an inaccuracy.

An attorney for the Treasury Department, Brian J. Sonfield, wrote a letter to the Ethics department this week explaining that Mnuchin’s sale had been cleared by the department, and that he believes the sale is “consistent with all applicable ethics laws and regulations.”

Mnuchin has now promised he will recuse himself from any business that could potentially have an impact on the production company.

But not having your financial records certified by the ethics office is a big deal, and extremely rare, according to the Times.

This isn’t Mnuchin’s first ethics scandal. Last year, for instance, the Center for Ethics and Responsibility in Washington found that Mnuchin had “between the spring and fall of 2017, [taken] eight separate trips on military aircraft at a total cost of nearly $1 million.”

“Those records make clear that Secretary Mnuchin has legitimately earned a place in the rogues’ gallery of cabinet secretaries who have abused their all too easy access to military and other non-commercial aircraft for both business travel and what, upon closer inspection, appears to sometimes include personal travel,” the group said at the time.

Democrats pointed out that whatever Mnuchin says, his actions were a violation of his promise to divest from the company.

“Before being confirmed by the Senate, he signed an ethics agreement that said he would divest from StormChaser Partners L.L.C.,” Senator Ron Wyden, the highest ranked Democrat on the Finance Committee, told the Times. “Rather than divest, he violated the spirit of his ethics agreement by selling his interest to his then-fiancée and then he violated the letter of the agreement when he reacquired the assets upon their marriage.”",justified accusation of fraud or scandal

An investment conman is starting a prison sentence, six years after I warned about him.

Robert McKendrick finally came to grief after ignoring court orders by trying to hide his loot from
investigators.

I told in March 2013 how he was behind African Land, which was flogging investments in rice plantations in Sierra Leone with the slogan “We harvest – you profit”.

It offered juicy potential annual returns of 15%, but I told how you might be buying land that was over-priced and impossible to sell.

In fact, African Land sold more plots to investors than it owned – it had 3,000 acres but flogged 5,365.

Half of the money paid by investors disappeared into the pockets of Capital Alternatives Limited, which marketed the scheme, as commission.

In 2013 the Financial Conduct Authority stopped it from recruiting more investors and obtained a freezing order against McKendrick, who lives in posh Alderley Edge, Cheshire.

In 2015, African Land was put into compulsory liquidation in the High Court on the grounds that it was not regulated and so was operating illegally, a finding later confirmed by the Appeal Court.

In March last year, the High Court ordered that around £17million should be repaid by leading figures in the schemes including 60-year-old McKendrick and accomplices Renwick Haddow and Marcia Hargous.

Haddow, 50, is currently in the United States where he's been charged in connection with separate investment scams that allegedly defrauded victims of £28million.

The UK courts made a further freezing order requiring McKendrick to disclose all his assets and barring him from disposing of them.

Now he’s been jailed for six months for contempt of court after trying to siphon away funds.

“Mr McKendrick misled investors and then, in contempt of court, failed to comply with court orders requiring him to properly account for the losses,” said Mark Steward, Executive Director of Enforcement and Market Oversight at the Financial Conduct Authority.

“The FCA will ensure that defendants who mislead investors are held to account to the fullest extent possible.”

The regulator revealed how sneaky McKendrick had diverted rental income from his portfolio of buy-to-let properties to his wife.

Mr Justice Marcus Smith noted in sentencing that he had admitted and apologised for the breaches but they were “many, varied and deliberate”.

McKendrick was the main director and sole shareholder of African Land, also known as Agri Capital.

He was also involved in a second unlawful Sierra Leone scheme called Reforestation Projects, aka Capital Carbon Credits.

Now that he has finally come clean about his assets, the FCA will try to recover as much as possible for investors.

Anyone who invested in African Land or Capital Carbon Credits needs to complete a questionnaire and send documents by 31 March 2019 – more information here:

Investors in any of the four schemes who have not yet contacted the FCA should do so, even if they no longer have records of the investments.

The regulator also wants to hear from victims of a £33million land investment fraud.

Around 870 people were conned by Countrywide Land Holdings Limited, Regional Land and Consolidated Land UK Limited.

Sales reps lied about the development prospects of the greenfield sites, which turned out to be worthless.

In December, Countrywide Land ringleader 38-year-old James Maynard from Croydon, Surrey, was jailed for seven and a half years for conspiracy to defraud. He had fled to Cyprus and was caught after sneaking back into Britain.

The regulator has received £2.5m from a related Panama company Paradigm Consultancy S.A. which will be returned to eligible investors.

A Mexican cartel boss and 27 coconspirators have been charged with laundering more than $10 million in drug proceeds through a local clothing retailer, announced U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Texas Erin Nealy Cox.

In a 38-count superseding indictment unsealed today, a federal grand jury charged 28 individuals connected to Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generacion – one of Mexico’s most violent and powerful drug cartels – with conspiracy to launder monetary instruments and other financial, drug, and gun crimes, including conspiracy to distribute methamphetamine, conspiracy to distribute heroin, and possession of a firearm by an undocumented alien.

“Drug cartels like CJNG wreak havoc across the globe, driving the spread of deadly drugs like meth and heroin,” said U.S. Attorney Nealy Cox. “We’re committed to tracking the money and disrupting these organizations by attacking their bottom line. By striking both the money and the drugs, we can more effectively impact the organization.”

“Addiction to drugs has many different faces. In this instance, the addiction to money and greed has met its consequence”, said Eduardo A. Chávez, Special Agent in Charge of the DEA Dallas Field Division. “Despite CJNG’s efforts to disguise their illegal activities into our North Texas communities, the DEA will seek to starve it of every last drug dollar and achieve justice for all those involved.”

According to court documents, Jose Valdovinos Jimenez, a plaza boss who goes by “La Roca” or “The Rock,” allegedly conspired with his codefendants to smuggle hundreds of kilograms of methamphetamine and heroin across the Mexican border, distribute the drugs within the United States, launder the proceeds, and then transfer the money back to CJNG leaders.

In order to insulate himself from law enforcement activity and limit losses from law enforcement raids, Mr. Jimenez and other leaders of CJNG implemented a compartmentalized infrastructure, relying on couriers to smuggle the drugs across the border, recrystallization laboratories to purify drugs for sale, fortified stash houses to store the drugs before distribution, and a multi-level dealer network to handle the cash.

At Mr. Jimenez’s direction, mid- and upper-level dealers transported drug proceeds to Yoli’s Western Wear, a clothing retailer located on Buckner Boulevard in Dallas. The 23-year-old manager of Yoli’s, Ivan Noe Valerio, and his family members then counted the money and separated it into thousands of transactions, sending it through a money remitter back to CJNG in Mexico.

An indictment is merely an allegation of criminal conduct, not evidence. Defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty in a court of law.

If convicted, Mr. Jimenez and Mr. Valero face life in federal prison.

Other defendants charged in the scheme include:

Teodoro Valerio Perez (Valerio’s father)
Yolanda Mercado Valerio (Valerio’s mother)
Iris Yaneli Valerio (Valerio’s sister)
Laurentino DelaCruz, aka “Tino,” (alleged meth dealer)
Carlo LNU, aka “Gordo,” (alleged wire transactions handler)
Jesus Manuel Juarez Aguilar, aka “Chucho,” (alleged wire transactions handler)
Cuauhtemoc Gonzalez Del Rio (alleged wire transactions handler)

Oscar Mario Flores Daza

Jorge Humberto Larios Velazco (alleged laboratory operator)
Arthur Ernest Rubalcaba (alleged stash house distributor)

During the course of this investigation, agents seized approximately 700 kilograms of methamphetamine, approximately 80 kilograms of heroin, and approximately $500,000 in drug proceeds. Dozens of the charged defendants have already been arrested.

The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration’s Dallas Field Division, the Texas Department of Public Security, the U.S. Marshals Service, and ICE Enforcement & Removal Operations conducted the investigation with the assistance of the Midlothian Police Department and Ellis County Sheriff’s Office.

An Indian court has sentenced the former head of Satyam Computers and nine others to seven years in prison in one of the country's biggest ever corporate scandals.

B Ramalinga Raju, who founded the software services giant, denied charges of conspiracy, cheating and forgery but admitted to accounting malpractices.

Raju was also fined $800,000.

The collapse of Satyam Computers in 2009 cost shareholders more than $2bn and rocked India's IT industry.

The BBC's Simon Atkinson in Mumbai says it is the biggest fraud at a listed company in India.

The convicted men are expected to appeal. The maximum sentence Raju faced was life in jail.

It's often described as India's Enron - and certainly the fraud at Satyam had much in common with the scandal that brought down the US energy giant in 2001. In both cases, the men in the boardroom systematically inflated profits in order to make their companies appear much healthier than they actually were.

Enron executives also concealed substantial debts. Both affairs, when they came to light, caused widespread shock and undermined confidence in the corporate sector. But the consequences of the Enron scandal were much greater. It caused the company to collapse. 20,000 employees lost their livelihoods and shareholders lost more than $70bn.

In the case of Satyam, the Indian government intervened to keep the company operating and engineered a takeover by the Mahindra Group. Shareholders still lost money, but the wider fallout from the scandal was much more limited.

Satyam was one of the biggest players in the booming Indian software market. The jobs of 50,000 Satyam workers were only saved after the government intervened.

Another Indian firm, Tech Mahindra, bought a controlling stake in the company in April 2009.

""All the accused have been convicted of almost all charges,"" prosecutor K Surender told reporters outside court,

Those convicted include two brothers of Raju.

Scandal timeline

January 2009: Raju resigns after admitting Satyam overstated profits for years. Company's stock suspended and government appoints new directors

February 2009: Federal CBI investigators take over investigation

November 2011: Supreme Court grants bail to Raju after the CBI fails to file charges in time

March 2012: Tech Mahindra and Mahindra Satyam announce plans to merge, creating one of India's biggest software companies

'Riding a tiger'

The scandal emerged in January 2009 when Mr Raju, one of the pioneers in the Indian IT industry and Satyam's founder and then chairman, confessed to manipulating his company's accounts and inflating profits over many years to the tune of about $1.15bn.

In a letter to the board he claimed he had fudged the numbers in order to be in the top four of the Indian IT industry.

""The concern was that poor performance would result in a takeover,"" he told shareholders.

""It was like riding a tiger, not knowing how to get off without being eaten.""

Prosecutors say that when the scam unravelled, it cost shareholders $2.3bn at today's rates.

The scam had been going on for nine years and the confession sent shockwaves across the industry.

Court papers filed by India's stock market regulator said that Mr Raju along with 13 other friends and family made about $400m in illegal wealth in the scam - by cashing in on a surging share price - offloading stakes in the company at a high price and making substantial profits despite knowing that accounts were overstated.

Raju was arrested in January 2009 and jailed before being bailed two years later. He also spent nearly a year in hospital being treated for hepatitis.

Rio de Janeiro's state prosecutors accuse Flavio Bolsonaro of embezzlement, money laundering and operating a criminal enterprise from 2007 to 2018, when he allegedly took money from his staffers' salaries when he was a Rio de Janeiro state lawmaker.

Flavio and 16 others, including his former driver, Fabricio Queiroz, are implicated in the alleged scheme.

Investigators reportedly began their probe into the money siphoning scheme in 2018, when auditors spotted unusual transfers of hundreds of thousands of dollars into an account held by Queiroz.

In an Instagram post, Flavio denied any wrongdoing, suggesting that the charges could be politically motivated because his father has previously campaigned on an anti-corruption platform.

Midway through the Republican National Convention on Tuesday, Pam Bondi, the former attorney general of Florida, railed against the supposed corruption of the Biden family: “A corrupt Ukrainian oligarch put Hunter [Biden] on the board of his gas company, even though he had no experience in the country ― or in the energy sector.” That may sound familiar, because that supposed malfeasance was at the heart of the scandal that led to President Donald Trump ’s impeachment late last year.

Impeachment proceedings in the House of Representatives showed that Trump threatened to withhold crucial military aid unless Volodymyr Zelensky, then Ukraine’s president-elect, opened an investigation into the Biden family and the discredited theory that Joe Biden intervened to end a criminal probe into the gas company where Hunter was on the board. The House voted to impeach Trump after several key actors in this scheme testified against him.

It’s a bold move to remind voters of the extensive scandal for which you were impeached less than a year ago. But Tuesday night’s RNC lineup amounted to an almost proud display of three and a half years of the Trump administration’s corruption ― from the mingling of the presidency and the Trump Organization, which the president did not divest from, to several flagrant displays of using federal resources to advance Trump’s re-election campaign. Four years after he campaigned on “draining the swamp,” Trump is showing off his graft.

Bondi was enmeshed in an entirely different Trump corruption scandal herself, although she claimed on Tuesday: “I fought corruption and I know what it looks like.”

As Florida’s attorney general in 2013, Bondi was considering joining the state of New York in a lawsuit against an affiliate of Trump University, Trump’s now-defunct for-profit education company, which was facing allegations of fraud. But after Trump donated $25,000 through his charity to a political action committee supporting Bondi’s re-election — violating federal tax laws in the process ― Bondi quietly decided not to join the case. (Trump’s campaign later claimed the donation was a “mistake,” and Trump himself paid a $2,500 IRS fine, because as a nonprofit, his charity is prohibited from making political gifts.)

Bondi is also a registered lobbyist for Qatar, which the U.S. Department of Justice has accused of bribing FIFA officials in exchange for hosting the 2022 World Cup, as The Daily Beast reported.

And then there was Eric Trump, who is still executive vice president of the Trump Organization but spoke during prime time at the RNC, urging people to vote for his father.

It was another bold move: Earlier in the day, the New York state attorney general asked a judge to force Eric Trump to answer subpoenas about whether the Trump Organization committed fraud by inflating its assets to get loans and tax breaks. To date, Eric has refused to comply with seven subpoenas about the matter.

His appearance underscored the extent to which President Trump has joined his company to his White House. In January 2017, there was a thin but pleasant fiction that once he became president, Trump would set aside the billion-dollar Trump Organization. In the first full press conference as president-elect, on Jan. 11 of that year, Trump said that while he wouldn’t divest from the Trump Organization, he would turn full control over to his sons Don Jr. and Eric. His lawyer told the press that day that the Trump family was “committed to ensuring that the activities of the Trump Organization are beyond reproach and cannot be perceived to be exploitive of the office of the presidency.” And Eric Trump told ABC News the following week that “we’ve taken extraordinary measures to make sure the two are separate and distinct.”

Eric’s convention speech eliminated any such distinction, but it was already largely gone. At least 12 foreign governments made payments to Trump Organization properties during Trump’s first two years in office, according to the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. Scores of political committees and special interests have done the same. Trump has constantly visited Trump Organization properties as president, and even awarded the Group of 7 summit to his Trump National Doral resort in Florida before reversing course.

Even now, Trump appears to be putting staffers who are paid by tax revenue to work on his campaign. Trump may have coerced White House employees into violating the Hatch Act, which prohibits federal employees from engaging in partisan political activities while on duty or on government property. Hundreds of staffers helped produce videos for the RNC, exposing them to potential legal ramifications including termination.

In another possible Hatch Act violation, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo addressed the RNC from Jerusalem, where he taped his remarks while on a foreign tour.

Democrats are launching an investigation into Pompeo’s participation in the convention, but State Department officials preemptively claimed that Pompeo — America’s top diplomat — would be speaking in a personal capacity, and therefore would not be breaking the law.

“What the hell does that mean?” one former Trump administration official, who requested anonymity to speak freely, said in an interview with HuffPost. “What personal capacity does a secretary of state have outside of, say, the bathroom?”

The showiest parts of Tuesday night’s RNC were two presidential acts, a pardon and a naturalization ceremony, carried out on live television — unprecedented events for a political convention. It was a stunning merger of Trump’s presidency with his re-election effort, and was immediately decried by ethics experts. “Simple enough, if this were not an attempt to influence the election, it wouldn’t happen at the convention,” said a statement from CREW.

But Trump has consistently run his presidency, and American foreign policy, as a political campaign and a profit-making scheme all at once. On Tuesday night, that was broadcast on television for the world to see.",corruption

Ricky George, 72, was sentenced to two years and his son Adam, 40, has also been jailed, for 15 months.

The fraud involved the sale of a house without the knowledge or consent of the owner, Hertfordshire Constabulary say.

A third man, Charles Jogi, was also convicted of money laundering at St Albans Crown Court.

The money was then laundered through his own bank account and that of his father and Jogi, his father's friend.

When the buyer of the house found out he had been a victim of fraud and had lost £250,000, he had a heart attack, police say, from which he has ""thankfully"" recovered.

Ricky George will always be known as the man who scored ""the other goal"" in that famous FA Cup third round replay win for non-league Hereford United over Newcastle United in January 1972.

This was back in the days when only a handful of games were televised every weekend - and even then, largely in black and white, only the recorded highlights.

And the goal that lives longest in the memory - and gets far more regularly shown - was Hereford's equaliser, Ronnie Radford's 35-yard rocket.

It was almost half an hour later before George had his own moment of fame, when he turned in the box to angle home a low right-foot shot across Newcastle keeper Willie McFaul.

His 103rd minute winner proved to be the highlight of his football career.

George would enjoy another major sporting highlight, 26 years on, as co-owner of Earth Summit, the the horse that won 1998 Grand National.

JERUSALEM (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is on trial for accepting gifts from wealthy friends. But that has not stopped him from seeking another gift from a wealthy friend to pay for his multimillion-dollar legal defense.

The awkward arrangement opens a window into the very ties with billionaire friends that plunged Netanyahu into legal trouble and sheds light on the intersection of money and Israeli politics.

Netanyahu has asked an Israeli oversight committee to allow a 10 million shekel ($2.9 million) donation from Spencer Partrich, a Michigan-based real estate magnate, to fund his legal defense. Because Partrich also happens to be a witness in one of the cases, the committee has asked the country’s attorney general for his opinion on the matter.

The request for financial aid from a friend is not illegal, and Israeli politicians have a long tradition of hobnobbing with wealthy Jewish supporters abroad. But to some, the optics of Netanyahu’s request are sketchy.

“It is a problem that we have prime ministers who have ties to moguls,” said Tomer Naor, of the Movement for Quality Government in Israel, a good governance group. “When the borders blur, you are blinded by the big money. You want more of it. Then all of a sudden the friend asks for a little favor and that poses a problem.”

Last month, Netanyahu’s trial on charges of fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes opened in a Jerusalem court. It is scheduled to resume next month.

The accusations include accepting some $200,000 in gifts such as cigars and champagne from two billionaires, Hollywood-based Israeli movie mogul Arnon Milchan and Australian magnate James Packer.

Netanyahu is also accused of offering to push legislation benefiting powerful Israeli media moguls in exchange for more positive coverage in their publications. Netanyahu has said he is the victim of a witch hunt and called the bribery allegations baseless, saying accepting gifts from friends isn’t a problem.

For his multimillion-dollar legal defense fees, Netanyahu has turned to both his wealthy American cousin, Nathan Milikowsky, and Partrich.

Netanyahu’s lawyers have asked a committee in the state comptroller’s office, an oversight body, to allow him to accept 10 million shekels from Partrich.

The approval process revealed that Netanyahu had already received a $300,000 donation from Milikowsky as well as suits and cigars from Partrich, which he did not receive permission for and was ordered to repay, according to the committee. The committee also asked repeatedly for Netanyahu to declare his assets, which he did not do, according to official documents released by the committee.

Last year, it declined his request for the 10 million shekels from Partrich, saying it was inappropriate given the charges against him, the documents show. The committee said its decision was final.

But when a new committee was formed under Netanyahu’s hand-picked state comptroller, it took up the request again, citing “a significant change in circumstances” that arose following Netanyahu’s indictment in January, according to the committee documents. It is now awaiting the attorney general’s opinion.

Netanyahu has already been allowed to accept a $570,000 loan from Partrich, the documents show. According to Naor from the good governance group, the money was meant to repay the Milikowsky money, which hasn’t been repaid, he said.

A person close to Netanyahu said the Partrich aid would not cover all of Netanyahu’s legal fees, and that someone earning a public servant’s salary could not be expected to pay for the steep fees on his own. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn’t authorized to discuss the legal fees with the media.

Netanyahu is believed to be a multimillionaire, thanks to best-selling books, real estate holdings and lucrative speaking fees while in the private sector. The country’s attorney general is looking into a murky company share deal with Milikowsky that reportedly netted Netanyahu an exorbitant return on investment.

Multiple messages left with Partrich’s office were not returned. Netanyahu’s spokesman declined to comment.

Netanyahu has for decades socialized with the ultra-wealthy and his supporters say he has given up opportunities to amass great wealth to serve the country instead. But he and his wife have gained a reputation for enjoying the good life, repeatedly landing in hot water for misusing state funds.

The indictment against Netanyahu highlights his ties. A number of well-known billionaires appear on the list of 333 potential witnesses, including Milchan and Packer, as well as U.S. casino magnate Sheldon Adelson, a longtime Netanyahu supporter, and Oracle Corp. co-founder and chairman Larry Ellison.

Witness number 283 is Partrich. According to the permits committee decision from last year, his relationship with Netanyahu stretches back to 1999, just as Netanyahu’s first term as prime minister was ending.

“Even if afterwards a personal friendship developed, at their core the ties between the two were formed as a relationship between a mogul and a senior politician,” the committee wrote.

According to a Channel 13 TV exposé, Netanyahu’s confidants nicknamed Partrich his “air taxi in the U.S.” because of the many times he flew on Partrich’s private jet during the decade between stints as prime minister.

A resident of upscale Bloomfield Hills, near Detroit, Partrich sits on the board of the Friends of the Israel Defense Forces, a group that runs programs for Israeli soldiers, and has donated more than $2 million to Wayne State University, where he has an auditorium named after him. He is an avid art collector and a fan of photojournalism.

According to the Israeli newspaper Haaretz, Partrich purchased Netanyahu’s brother’s half of the Jerusalem home they inherited from their father. The deal has raised questions about what interest an American business magnate would have in a relatively small transaction.

Anshel Pfeffer, an Israeli journalist who wrote “Bibi,” a Netanyahu biography, said seeking money from a wealthy friend is a way for Netanyahu to “double down” on his claim that none of the gifts he received were wrong.

“This kind of says he doesn’t give a damn about the optics because he thinks he deserves it, and he doesn’t think in any way this should be seen as illegal,” Pfeffer said.",corruption
TMML2024032071547,Dominic Chappell,"Alert ID: TMML2024032071547
Dominic Chappell, the former owner of BHS, has been sentenced to six years in jail for tax evasion.

A Southwark Crown Court jury found him guilty of failing to pay tax of around £584,000 on £2.2m of income he received after buying the failed chain for £1.

The court heard the 53-year-old spent the money on two yachts, a Bentley and a holiday to the Bahamas.

Chappell's lawyers claimed he became ""utterly broke"" after BHS's ""pension problem exploded"" in 2015.

Mr Chappell controversially bought the retailer from tycoon Sir Philip Green that year, but the chain collapsed soon after in 2016. It led to the loss of 11,000 jobs and a pension deficit of £571m.

Five issues at the heart of the BHS story
'I was in charge of millions, then I had nothing'

In sentencing, the judge said Chappell had engaged in a ""long and consistent course of conduct designed to cheat the revenue"".

""You are not of positive good character. Your offending occurs against a backdrop of successive bankruptcies,"" he said.

Simon York, director of the Fraud Investigation Service at HMRC, said: ""This was deliberate theft from UK citizens. Chappell was a high-profile businessman who knew tax had to be paid on his income and profits but chose not to do so.

""That's money that should have been supporting our vital public services instead of funding his lavish lifestyle.""

'Struggling chain'

BHS, once one of Britain's best known retailers, was losing £1m a week and had a huge pension deficit when Chappell's consortium, Retail Acquisitions, bought it in 2015.

In his year of ownership Mr Chappell received £2.5m in payments from BHS , largely for consultancy fees provided by another of his companies, the bankrupt finance firm Swiss Rock Limited.

Sir Philip Green was heavily criticised for agreeing to the deal, and later agreed a £363m cash settlement with the Pensions Regulator to plug the gap in the pension scheme.

However, on Thursday prosecutors condemned Chappell for spending large sums of money at a time when he should have been trying to save BHS.

""Chappell purchased the struggling retail chain for just £1 and was paid thousands of pounds in his new role, where he was tasked with avoiding more redundancies,"" said crown prosecutor Andrew Fox.

""Instead, while the company fell further into financial difficulty, he spent his new income lavishly on luxury breaks abroad and expensive yachts.""

'Reckless financial transactions'

The court heard Chappell, a former racing driver, also bought £11,000 worth of items from a gun and outdoor wear shop, including expensive Beretta firearms.

Prosecutors said HMRC repeatedly tried to chase down the missing funds, but Chappell ignored their requests, at one point going on a skiing break before asking for more time to pay the money when he returned home.

In his defence, Chappell argued he was too busy resolving issues with BHS to deal with the outstanding taxes that were due.

He had denied three charges of tax fraud.

Earlier this year Chappell was ordered to pay £9.5m into BHS pension schemes after losing an appeal.",tax evasion
TMML2024032504548,Gerald A. Eaton,"Alert ID: TMML2024032504548
A former Commonwealth Financial Network advisor allegedly steered millions of dollars from clients to himself over 20 years of deception in a practice near the firm’s headquarters.

Gerald A. Eaton forged signatures, made false representations to Commonwealth and insurance companies and even used an account under his wife’s first name and a fake last name to steal $3.7 million from at least 15 clients, according to the Massachusetts U.S. Attorney’s office.

Eaton, 51, pleaded guilty to three felony fraud charges on Sept. 30.

Eaton “liquidated securities, as well as insurance policies, annuities and other insurance vehicles in client accounts, for the purpose of misappropriating the proceeds to his own personal use,” such as credit card payments and a home equity line of credit, according to the federal criminal information document filed by prosecutors.

“Each such sale was deceptive,” the document continues, “because it was neither authorized by, nor disclosed to, Eaton’s clients, was not for their benefit, and was done with the intention of converting the money to Eaton’s own use.”

Eaton’s attorneys didn’t respond to a request for comment on the allegations. In a Sept. 1 letter to his lawyers, federal prosecutors stated that Eaton’s offense level for sentencing purposes will be lower because he “accepted responsibility” for his crimes.

Commonwealth terminated him in October 2019 after nearly 25 years with the firm due to allegations of forgery and “wrongful taking of property,” according to FINRA BrokerCheck. Commonwealth says that upon learning of the conduct, the firm fired Eaton immediately, alerted the U.S. Attorney’s office and worked closely with investigators in the case.

“Justice was served when Mr. Eaton admitted to his immoral and criminal behavior in court and pleaded guilty to the charges,” CEO Wayne Bloom said in a statement. “Commonwealth stands firm in its belief that financial advisors should be held to a high standard of trust, and will continually work to protect investor assets.”

Eaton’s Boston-area practice, Heritage Financial Group, was located in Acton, Massachusetts, which is roughly a half-hour drive to Commonwealth’s headquarters in Waltham. He earned a CFP certification and had built the practice to roughly 200 clients after nearly three decades in the industry, according to the charging document.

The long-running scheme often victimized seniors or clients in poor mental or physical health, investigators say. In one example alleged in the criminal information document, Eaton transferred an annuity worth $68,000 to an account in his wife’s name by forging her signature and that of the victim, an elderly man, while falsely representing to the issuer that she was the client’s granddaughter.

He also transferred an elderly woman’s $550,000 investment account to one he set up under the made-up name of “Gaton,” according to investigators. To do so, he simply represented the incoming shares as a gift from the victim, investigators say.

Eaton pleaded guilty last month to wire fraud, mail fraud and aggravated identity theft. The SEC barred Eaton last month and FINRA barred him in November 2019 after his termination from Commonwealth.

In the letter to Eaton’s attorneys, federal prosecutors wrote that the “loss attributable to identifiable victims” is $3.78 million but that additional theft that isn’t attributable to specific victims would likely push the total above $6 million.

The guilty plea requires Eaton to pay restitution to the known victims, and authorities will create a listing of them ahead of Eaton’s Jan. 26 sentencing hearing. He’ll also have to forfeit assets if he can’t pay the victims, according to the court documents.",charged for fraud

Mark Woodbridge, a company executive, has been sentenced today at Oxford Crown Court to three years and ten months' imprisonment (see note 1) for a fraud where accounts were manipulated to show healthy trading.

This is the conclusion of a fraud conspiracy prosecution against four former executives of retail software company, Torex Retail plc.

Additionally Mr Woodbridge has been disqualified from acting as a company director for three years and is to pay costs of £170,000 within 12 months.

One of the executives, Nigel Horn who was tried alongside Mr Woodbridge, was acquitted. Two others on the same indictment, Christopher Moore and Robert Loosemore, were not tried alongside Woodbridge and Horn as they had already pleaded guilty ahead of trial.

Torex Retail plc, a company involved in the retail software sector for touch-screen tills, was formed in 2004. The company, which was listed on the Alternative Investment Market of the London Stock Exchange, went into administration in June 2007 following the suspension of trading in shares of the company on 26 January 2007. The offences took place between 1 May 2006 and 26 January 2007.

The four defendants

Verdicts were returned over 19 and 20 June.

Found guilty of two counts of conspiracy to defraud and one count of false accounting was:

Mark Gavin Woodbridge 42 of Kineton, Warwick. He was Group Financial Accountant for the Torex Retail Group of Companies.
Acquitted of conspiracy to defraud was:

Nigel David Horn 59 of Bourton-on-the-Water, Gloucestershire. Legal Director and Company Secretary. The jury could not reach a verdict. The prosecution is not to seek a retrial and the judge directed that he be acquitted.
The defendants who pleaded guilty ahead of trial to two counts of conspiracy to defraud are:

Christopher Edward Moore 58 of Hook Norton, Banbury. He was appointed Chief Executive Officer in February 2005 and replaced Mr Loosemore as Executive Chairman in September 2005. Mr Moore stood down as Chief Executive Officer in September 2006, but retained the post of Chairman.
Robert William Loosemore 47 of Oxford. He was Executive Chairman of Torex Retail Plc until September 2005. His association with Torex continued thereafter as a consultant and major shareholder.
Conspiracy to defraud contrary to common law (two counts)

Messrs Moore and Loosemore pleaded guilty and Mark Woodbridge was found guilty of conspiring to defraud the shareholders of the company between May and August 2006 by falsely inflating by £6.5m the cash at bank/revenue figures of the company's interim results which were published on 14 August 2006. In order to justify these entries the defendants created two false documents; a false distribution agreement worth £5m between the company and Mr Loosemore's private company, Magdalen Consulting Ltd; and a false ""Goodwill Deposit"" agreement worth £1.5m between the company and Mr Loosemore.

Messrs Moore and Loosemore pleaded guilty and Mark Woodbridge was found guilty of further conspiring between November 2006 and 26 January 2007 to defraud the shareholders of the company by creating a further false agreement between the company and Magdalen Consulting Ltd which purported to vary the original false distribution agreement in order to sustain the original fraud. Mr Horn was acquitted of this offence, the only one he faced.

Messrs Moore and Loosemore were sentenced in January this year: Moore to 30 months imprisonment for each count, to be served concurrently. He was also ordered to pay £100,000 in prosecution costs and disqualified as a director for one year; Loosemore to 20 months imprisonment for each count, to be served concurrently. He was also ordered to pay £50,000 in prosecution costs and disqualified as a director for one year. These sentences could not be previously reported.

False accounting contrary to s17 (1)(a) Theft Act 1968 (three counts)

Mr Woodbridge was found guilty of one count of false accounting between May and August 2006 by causing a further sum of £2m revenue to be falsely recognised in the company's interim financial statement. He was acquitted of two other counts.

Investigation and Proceedings

The investigation began on 29 January 2007. A number of residential property searches were undertaken and a business premises in Banbury were undertaken on 29 and 30 January 2007 and 21 March 2007. The defendants were charged in May 2011 and the trial of Woodbridge and Horn opened on 18 March 2013. Messrs Moore and Loosemore entered pleas on 11 January 2013 and were sentenced on 30 January 2013.

XN Checkout

Separate to these proceedings, but as part of the Torex investigation, two directors of a Torex subsidiary company XN Checkout Ltd, Edwin Dayan and Christopher Ford, were convicted in January 2011 of conspiracy to defraud Torex shareholders by causing false profits to be entered in the published 2005 year end accounts and the 2006 interim accounts, attributed to a fabricated agreement with pub chain outlet Mitchells & Butler.

During the time that Joaquín 'El Chapo' Guzmán Loera was imprisoned in the maximum security prison of Puente Grande, in Jalisco, he coincided with Héctor Luis Palma Salazar 'El Güero Palma', his alleged right-hand man in his early days as a drug trafficker.

During that time, El Chapo, founder of the Sinaloa Cartel, and other drug lords held in the same prison enjoyed privileges, such as large parties and visits from women, thanks to the corruption network they established with prison officials, including Dámaso López Núñez, 'El Licenciado', who later joined Guzmán Loera's criminal organization. This was confirmed by inmate Diana Patricia Guzmán Flores, who said that she had an affair with Palma Salazar while they were imprisoned in Puente Grande.

The alleged partner of Palma claimed that Chapo's group distributed USD 20,000 every two weeks among the custodians who protected them and knew they were part of the corruption network.

The testimony of the prisoner sentenced to 27 years for homicide and crimes against health was announced to be broadcast on July 17, 2018, on the news program of Mexican journalist Ciro Gómez Leyva, but it was not passed in full because 'El Güero Palma' asked the production not to broadcast it because he considered that the information could affect his rights and cause him moral damage.

In the advance that had been transmitted in television of the interview, Diana assured that the drug dealer had a powerful public official under his control, she also affirmed that the day that El Chapo escaped, the parties in the maximum-security prison, which were characterized by being entertained by musical groups and having food bought in restaurants from outside, were over.

Palma Salazar made the request by means of a letter and clarified that Diana was never his girlfriend and even denied knowing her; he asked not to air false facts that will harm his criminal process.

Palma Salazar is currently in the Altiplano prison to serve his sentence for aggravated homicide against Antonio Contreras, who was then the deputy director of the Nayarit State Judicial Police, and his escort, José Cruz Guerrero, in May 1995.

""EL GÜERO"" PALMA: THE NARCO THAT SURVIVED THE PRISON

He was arrested by chance and released from a prison in the United States for good behavior. Hector ""El Güero"" Palma Salazar was considered one of the most violent drug traffickers in Mexico in the 80s and 90s and was a close friend of Joaquín ""El Chapo"" Guzmán.

Palma was born in La Noria de Abajo, in the municipality of Mocorito, Sinaloa, and only studied Primary because of the poverty of his family. The crime soon reached his life, and in his teens, he already stole cars.

He called the attention of Miguel Ángel Félix Gallardo, the largest cocaine and marihuana drug dealer in Mexico, also known as ""The Chief of Chiefs"" or ""The Godfather"", who hired him as a hitman in the 70s and later ordered him to smuggle cocaine in Sonora.

A young Joaquín ""El Chapo"" Guzmán also worked for Felix Gallardo in the Guadalajara Cartel, so he became a close friend of ""El Güero"", who was accused of keeping a drug shipment, so his boss did not It took him revenge.

Towards the end of the eighties, ""El Güero"" and Guzmán Loera rose in leaps and bounds towards the leadership in the world of drug trafficking with the Sinaloa Cartel, but soon the worst blow came for Palma.

""El Padrino"", allegedly ordered to kill the children and the wife of ""El Güero"", to whom he sent the head of his beloved. The murder, at the hands of Colombian narco leader Rafael Clavel Moreno, of the Felix Gallardo group, removed Palma Salazar from anonymity, because an unprecedented battle between the criminals was created.

""El Güero"" built a mausoleum for his family with an estimated value of USD 420,000, in the Jardines del Humaya Pantheon, in Culiacán, Sinaloa. On the roof, there is a painting of his wife and children.

In revenge, he ordered the murder of nine friends and relatives of Felix Gallardo. Some of the bodies presented multiple blows, skull fractures, and a burst of viscera.

A small plane that moved him from Ciudad Obregón, Sonora, to Guadalajara Jalisco, collapsed. When he was convalescing after the accident, the military discovered him in June 1995 thanks to his striking and unmistakable Colt Super 83 pistol.

Mexican authorities sentenced him to seven years in prison at the high-security prison in Puente Grande, Jalisco, for possession of cocaine, drug trafficking, and organized crime. In the penitentiary of Puente Grande, he coincided with his friend ""El Chapo"", who had been apprehended in 1993, until January 2001 when Guzmán Loera escaped.

In the company of ""El Chapo"" and Arturo Martínez ""El Texas"", he took over the entire Puente Grande prison. The investigation into the escape of Guzmán revealed that the three criminals imposed the rules inside the penitentiary center. Palma was accused by the Prosecutor's Office of being one of the accomplices of the escape; however, he was acquitted of this charge years later.

In 2007, Palma was extradited to the US and convicted of trafficking cocaine in 2008. He was first sent to a prison in Phoenix, Arizona, where he had contact with other inmates. But once he was sentenced to 16 years in prison and 5 years of probation, he was sent to the federal prison of the State of Colorado, in the center of the United States.

It was ADX Florence, the safest maximum-security prison in the country, in which Guzmán Loera could serve a life sentence. The place is famous for the view that the mountains of Fremont County offer. However, the penitentiary is designed so that prisoners can never appreciate them.

""The worst of the worst in the vast network of American prisons usually ends in ADX, also known as The Rocky Alcatraz,"" said former prison director Robert Hood in a special report for CNN.

In that place, Palma never saw other inmates. He spent 23 hours a day in his cell and at hour 24 he could see the sun in the sky, through a window in the ceiling. He did not speak English and the guards did not speak Spanish, so ""for long periods of time I had no one to talk to,"" his lawyer Frank Ragen said, according to the Mexican newspaper Milenio.

Some of the inmates in said prison are Eric Rudolph, an American terrorist responsible for the attacks in the Olympic Games of Atlanta in 1996; Zacarias Moussaoui, a former member of Al Qaeda who participated in the planning of the September 11 attacks; Ramzi Yousef, considered the ""brain"" of the attack on the Twin Towers and Ted Kaczynski (The Unabomber), a Harvard graduate who between 1978 and 1995 sent 16 bomb letters to different universities in the country.

ADX Florence has been criticized by organizations defending human rights due to its harsh conditions of isolation. Palma served nine of the 16 years in prison for his sentence for drug trafficking. The US authorities considered him to have behaved well during his incarceration and released him on June 15, 2016.

""El Güero"" Palma left the prison at age 56, with an inguinal hernia, hemorrhoids, poor vision, and several missing teeth, Mexican media reported. He was the second leader of a cartel released from a US jail. The first was Francisco Arellano Félix, in 2008.

He was deported and apprehended in Mexico for the murder of a judicial officer and his escort in the 1990s. He remains in the Altiplano penitentiary, in the State of Mexico.

WHY THE FAMILY OF EL GÜERO PALMA WAS KILLED

It was 1989, the Guadalajara Cartel was very strong; then El Chapo and Guero Palma waged a war against the Arellano Felix which ended in blood.

In February 1985, the death of Enrique Camarena, a DEA agent, forced the arrest of ""El Jefe de Jefes"", Miguel Angel Felix Gallardo, leaving a power vacuum, which soon began to be disputed between ""El Chapo"" and the Arellano Felix brothers.

It was 1989, the Guadalajara Cartel controlled drugs in Mexico but the fall of Felix Gallardo caused his disappearance, his partners, Rafael Caro Quintero and Ernesto Fonseca Carrillo were also arrested.

In the absence of the Guadalajara Cartel's leaders, the differences between other drug traffickers such as Héctor ""El Güero"" Palma, Joaquín el ""Chapo"" Guzmán, and the Arellano Félix began. One of the violent events was the day that the family of Hector ""El Guero"" Palma was murdered by orders of the Arellano Felix. But why was the family of the Güero Palma killed?

The origin of the war

The blood began to flow when the Arellano Felix brothers began to murder people from ""El Chapo"" and ""El Güero"", which was fatally detonated by the cruel murder of ""El Güero""'s family. This crime was orchestrated by the Arellano Felix, who hired a man to gain the trust of Palma Salazar's wife and later conquer her and take her away. This happened, the woman was murdered and her two small children were thrown off a bridge.

Palma Salazar began to act in a really bloodthirsty manner in the face of this fact and had all the backing of the ""Chapo"". The union of these three characters formed, according to the recent confession of ""El Rey"" Zambada, brother of Ismael Zambada, ""La Federación"", which would later receive the name of the Sinaloa Cartel. At that time, the cartel was also made up of the Beltrán Leyva brothers.

Personally, according to ""El Rey"" Zambada, the ""Chapo"" was looking forward to the death of Ramón Arellano Félix, who was head of the cartel's hitmen. According to El Espectador, the Arellano Felix brothers did not agree and Amado Carrillo, ""The Lord of the Skies,"" agreed to join Chapo and his allies against the Tijuana cartel.

It was after Chapo Guzman's escape from Guatemala City prison in 2001 that the Sinaloa Cartel gained control of the Arellano Felix family, taking many lives in the war, including the famous murder of Cardinal Posadas Ocampo in Guadalajara.

A war that ""ended"" with Ramon's death at the Mazatlan Carnival

On February 10, 2002, at approximately 10:00 a.m., elements of the Ministerial Police were chasing the five occupants of a white car with VFY 6068 plates from Sinaloa, all because they were traveling in the opposite direction on Rafael Buelna Avenue near the Golden Zone. It was then that the young man was taken to the parking lot of a hotel where he was abandoned.

Ángel Antonio Árias Torres, the then commander of the Ministerial Police, ran into someone who identified himself as Jorge Pérez López with a name tag from the Attorney General's Office; it was actually Ramón Arellano Félix.

He took advantage of the moment when the commander let his guard down to shoot him twice in the chest. The bullets did their part. When Angel Antonio Arias Torres fell almost dead he reacted and shot the alleged AFI agent who was shot in the head. The commander may not have known who he ""took out in front of him. Both bodies fell dead on the sidewalk and garrison outside a pharmacy.",

Ayotzinapa: Debunking the “Historic Truth”

On July 7, the attorney general’s office announced that the University of Innsbruck — a collaborating institute in the investigation into the 2014 kidnapping and disappearance of forty-three students from the Ayotzinapa Rural Teaching College — had identified the remains of one of the bodies. Crucially, the remains were not found where the Peña Nieto government had insisted the killings occurred but nearly a kilometer away, in a ravine known as the Barranca de la Carnicería.

Ayotzinapa marked the beginning of the end for Peña Nieto, not least because his government insisted on pushing a version of events, famously referred to as the “ historic truth,” that was clearly self-serving. In its version, the students were apprehended by local police in the town of Iguala, turned over to the criminal organization Guerreros Unidos, and killed and burned in a garbage dump in the nearby town of Cocula. But this so-called “historic truth” had always been hotly contested, not least by the families of the victims, and when an international team of experts known as the GIEI got too hot under the collar for the government with its own investigation, it was bounced out of the country in 2016.

On July 10, extradition proceedings were initiated for Tomás Zerón, the former head of the Criminal Investigation Agency (AIC) who had been instrumental in formulating the “historic truth,” on charges of torture, forced disappearance, altering a crime scene, and the loss and concealment of proof in the case. Zerón had fled to Canada in March.

Meanwhile, new evidence based on fresh witness testimony alleges what the Peña administration always strenuously denied: that the army — specifically the 27th and 41st Battalions — was intimately involved in the detention of the students on the fateful night of September 26. Not only that, but a number of the members of these battalions were to have been directly on the payroll of the Guerreros Unidos in order to allow the transport of drugs, arms, and money throughout the region, as well as participating in the disappearance of the forty-three students.

In fact, it is suspected that one of the main reasons the army got involved in the first place was that the students had inadvertently seized a pair of buses that contained a shipment of heroin worth two million dollars.

These accusations put President Andrés Manuel López Obrador (AMLO) in a delicate spot. From the outset of his administration, he has leaned on the armed forces for everything from the construction of the new Mexico City airport to the transport of gasoline to, recently, sending the navy to seize control of the nation’s ports in a bid to fight corruption there.

Historically answerable only to a series of complicit presidents, the Mexican army is among the most hermetic of institutions, with its own court system and a secretary of defense who has always been an active-duty soldier. Whether AMLO will be able to pry it open to allow the corruption in its own ranks to be investigated will be a stiff test for his resolve.

Most urgently, it is Enrique Peña Nieto who is feeling the heat. On July 20, he celebrated his 54th birthday in seclusion, without the fanfare and hoopla of previous years. It’s not without irony that one hopes he enjoyed it. His coming year stands to be significantly less pleasant than the last.",corruption

Brazil's attorney general charged President Michel Temer on Thursday with obstruction of justice and leading a criminal organization, according to a press release on the attorney general's website.

It's the latest round of corruption allegations against Temer, who survived an impeachment vote in August. Six other members of Temer's political party, PMDB, were also named in the charges filed by attorney general Rodrigo Janot.

In a statement posted on its website, Temer's office dismissed the charges as ""absurd"" and said they were an attempt by the attorney general to ""cover his own faults."" The statement added that ""the truth will prevail"" and Temer will be able to focus on governing.

Janot said the latest charges stem from plea-bargain testimony given by Joesley Batista, who turned himself in to authorities on Sunday. Batista is the former chairman of JBS, the world's largest meatpacking company. The Brazil-based company has admitted to doling out $150 million in bribes to some 2,000 politicians over a decade.

According to Brazilian state media, Batista recorded a phone call between himself and Temer last spring in which Temer allegedly suggested giving hush money to the country's former house speaker, Eduardo Cunha, to buy his silence. Attorney General Janot on Thursday brought new charges against Cunha, who is now in prison for money laundering, among other charges.

Batista gave his testimony implicating Temer last spring in exchange for the plea agreement. This week, he and his brother Wesley were charged with insider trading, which prompted the government to suspend the plea deal, state media reported. This week, their lawyers called those charges ""unjust.""

In speeches and statements, Temer denied that he suggested bribing Cunha and said the phone recording was doctored to make him look bad.

The new charges could be a blow to Temer's pro-business agenda, which includes tax and pension reform. Earlier this month, finance minister Henrique Meirelles told the Wall Street Journal he expected those reforms to become law soon.

It also marks the latest twist in a period of deep corruption in Brazil. Temer's predecessor, Dilma Rousseff, was impeached last year on charges of manipulating the government's budget. Rousseff denied the charges.

Brazil's wildly popular former president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who preceded Rousseff, was sentenced in July to nearly 10 years in prison. He is appealing the case.

Temer will only face trial if two-thirds of the country's lower house of Congress votes to suspend him. His term ends at the end of 2018.

More broadly, a widespread bribery ring involving Brazilian politicians, the state-run oil company Petrobras and Brazil's largest construction company Odebrecht, helped plunge South America's largest nation into its worst recession on record. The recession officially ended earlier this year but the recovery has been anemic.",charged

A man has been jailed for almost four years after trying to board a flight to Dubai with £1.5m in his luggage.

Mohamed Imran Khan Sathar Khan, 35, was arrested at Stansted Airport on 29 August after Border Force officers found four of his holdalls were stuffed with £10 and £20 notes.

Sathar Khan, who claimed to be living in Ilford, east London, denied all knowledge of the money.

He was jailed for three years and nine months at Chelmsford Crown Court.

Officers from the National Crime Agency (NCA), who charged Sather Khan with two money laundering offences, found he had made several trips to Dubai before being caught.

The money was forfeited under Proceeds of Crime legislation.

Matt Rivers, from the NCA, said it was ""a significant seizure"".

Taylor Wilson, assistant director of the Border Force at Stansted Airport, said: ""By making this detection, Border Force officers have taken a substantial quantity of criminal cash out of circulation and ensured it will be returned to the public purse.

""Depriving criminals of their wealth disrupts organised crime and we will continue to work with law enforcement partners like the NCA to both bring offenders to justice and to hit them in the pocket.""

A serial fraudster who posed as a solicitor and pretended to represent ‘extremely vulnerable’ women in court cases has been jailed for four years and handed a ten-year restraining order.

Stephen Davey, 49, pleaded guilty to two counts of fraud by false representation, making articles to use in fraud, possessing articles to use in fraud and theft. He was sentenced at Liverpool Crown Court.

According to a statement by Cheshire Constabulary, Davey put two women in touch with a 'solicitor', who offered to represent them in family court cases at a discount price. The solicitor did not in fact exist and money went into Davey’s bank account.

All dealings with the ‘solicitor’ were done via email and Davey made excuses when he was due to meet the women. According to the police statement, Davey told the women that their court cases were going well and emailed them various legal documents to back up his claims.

At one point, Davey told a mother that she had won full custody of her children and had been awarded £65,000.

As a result of Davey’s deception, the women were not represented in court and both their cases were put in ‘severe jeopardy’.

According to the police statement, Davey also posed as a police officer and a probation worker and convinced a woman he was in love with her in order to extort money. The court heard that Davey extorted more than £7,000 in total from his victims.",fraud

Two months before one of the world's largest data leaks, dubbed the Panama Papers, was made public on Sunday, Brazilian prosecutors accused the Panama law firm Mossack Fonseca at the center of the leak, of corruption. (The firm, whose leaked records span 40 years and make up the Panama Papers, according to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), issued a statement to the ICIJ denying any unlawful activities. In addition, it stated that ties to offshore companies is not an implication of wrongdoing.)

On January 27 Brazil's Federal Police, as part of Brazil's far-reaching corruption probe known as Operation Car Wash (""Operação Lava Jato""), accused the firm of helping clients create offshore entities to hide corrupt money. Prosecutors alleged that the firm was using real estate company OAS Empreendimentos Imobiliários S/A to help cover up money made in the criminal scheme involving state-owned oil giant Petrobras. Six temporary arrests were made and 16 search warrants were issued. Lawyers representing those arrested denied any wrongdoing or irregularities. FORBES has been unable to reach the firm for comment. Aside from its office in Brazil, the firm also has branches in 40 other cities.

According to the ICIJ, which on Sunday began sharing information on the Panama Papers, Mossack Fonseca's cofounder Ramón Fonseca, an adviser to Panama's president, ""took a leave of absence as presidential adviser in March after his firm was implicated in the Brazil scandal and ICIJ and its partners began to ask questions about the law firm’s practices.""

At least 29 billionaires and former billionaires have been outed for allegedly having ties to offshore wealth (see story here). No Brazilian billionaires have been named so far. According to Brazilian newspaper O Estado de São Paulo, several current and former Brazilian government officials belonging to almost every political party are allegedly implicated. Among them, João Lyra, a former deputy and once Brazil's richest parliament member according to the ICIJ, was named for not disclosing an offshore holding or Swiss bank account. According to Brazilian law, individuals are allowed to have offshore accounts as long as they are registered in the country for tax purposes. Lyra has not commented on the leak. Idalécio de Castro Rodrigues de Oliveira, a Portuguese business executive accused of allegedly supplying cash used to bribe Eduardo Cunha, the president of Brazil’s Chamber of Deputies, was also named for creating offshore companies right before the alleged bribe took place. De Oliveira didn't comment on the allegations and Cunha denied allegations.

In addition, according to Brazilian news website UOL, the Queiroz Galvão family, the Odebrecht company and Grupo Petrópolis, all under investigation for corruption as part of Operation Car Wash, were also named among those allegedly hiding offshore wealth. Odebrecht has not commented on the release; Queiroz Galvão released as statement denying wrongdoing; and Grupo Petropolis released a statement saying it has no connections to Mossack Fonseca and any transactions it has made have been within the law.

Operation Car Wash, the largest corruption sweep in modern Brazilian history, led to the arrest of billionaire banker Andre Esteves (who has since been released and is under house arrest; through a lawyer he has denied any wrongdoing) and charges leveled against former Brazilian president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, known as “Lula” (who has vehemently denied wrongdoing). It now threatens to help unseat President Dilma Rousseff, who is undergoing impeachment proceedings as Brazilians take to the streets to protest what they say is a corrupt government.

TMML2024032930575,Rami Makhlouf,"Alert ID: TMML2024032930575
The ascent of Bashar al-Assad in 2000 paved the way for a new rampant class of corrupt businessmen – often sons or relatives of the governing apparatus which inaugurated the Assad era in Syria in 1970. Thus, his fellow Alawite maternal cousin and close confidant, Rami Makhlouf (b. 1969) was able to become the wealthiest man in the country. Makhlouf’s privileged position was well-known and became a lightning rod for popular rage and discontent during the 2011 Syrian uprising. Makhlouf used corruption, intimidation and governmental ties to expand his businesses and amass a fortune even without secrecy. Moreover, his predatory-capitalistic approach proved detrimental for the economy itself, limiting the Syrian middle class, as he earned the nickname of Mister Five – or Ten – percent, depending of the interest percentage he received on every loan his companies would make. In the analysis which follows, a focus on this particular player highlights the new opportunities for predatory capitalism which have been unearthed due to the Syrian war economy that emerged beginning in 2011.

Sanctions and business shift
In the March 2011 demonstrations held in the city of Dara’a, Syrian citizens raged against the magnate as well, in addition to chanting slogans against the regime, and burned a local Syriatel branch. This was not coincidental. [2] It was, in fact, an indicator that Makhlouf, despite his attempt at maintaining a low public profile, had indeed been included by the Syrian opposition as part of what they viewed to be an evil triumvirate responsible for having led the country to disaster. Makhlouf controlled several mafia-style businesses and monopolies which had worsened the economic conditions of many Syrians. The other members of the trio are Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, who was blamed for mismanaging the government and for being an elitist, and his brother Maher, who controlled Syria’s brutal security apparatus.

On the international stage, Makhlouf had already been discredited and sanctioned; in 2008 the US Treasury National Department designated him as “responsible for having benefitted from public corruption of senior officials of the Syrian regime.” [3] On May 11, 2011, a few weeks after the beginning of the uprisings, the European Union sanctioned the billionaire as well by forbidding his travel to EU countries and freezing his accounts therein. Alongside Makhlouf, twelve other members of Assad’s inner circle were blacklisted, including Maher. [4]

Despite Makhlouf’s occasional indication of his intention of exiting his businesses, [5] it turns out that, on the contrary, he was too dependent on the fate of the regime to abandon the country or to passively accept the events that followed the 2011 uprising. In fact, he took full advantage of the horrifying conflict to further strengthen his grip on Syria and benefit from the new war economy that had begun to develop.

Now that many parts of the country have been destroyed, those close to the regime aim to capitalize on rebuilding projects. Most recently, thanks to a government decree, a spin-off of Makhlouf’s Damascus al-Cham Holdings joint-capital investment firm is positioned to control a planned massive real estate project – including a large new shopping mall – in place of the slums of Damascus. This is specifically designed to attract a new elite class which will be loyal to the regime. [6] Moreover, Syria expert Joshua Landis noted recently that Makhlouf’s firm has received a license for Syria’s first mortgage finance operation—giving the Makhlouf-Assad family even deeper control of the economy in addition to another mechanism for shaping the demographics of Syria’s housing landscape. [7]

Illegal trade
In order to finance Assad’s repression and build his own empire, Makhlouf smuggled assets from Lebanon and Europe, in particular by monopolizing the tobacco trade. On May 25,2011 Makhlouf managed to receive a shipment of 90 million cigarettes distributed in 9,000 cases by IBCS, the Middle-Eastern partner of Japan Tobacco International (JTI). The cigarettes were loaded in the port of Limassol, Cyprus, a member state of the EU. Just four days earlier the EU had decided to impose sanctions on Makhlouf’s assets. Makhlouf succeeded in bypassing the sanctions thanks to his Cypriot citizenship, which had been given to him a few months prior by its government, and which was later extended to the rest of his family. [8] The tobacco shipment was unloaded in Makhlouf’s stronghold of Lattakia port and distributed to duty-free shops under his control. [9]

The cigarettes were used as a source of income or even as an alternative currency to pay the regime-allied shabiha and other irregular battalions loyal to Damascus. [10] The shabiha – literally ‘ghosts’ – started operating in the late 70’s, during the Syrian intervention in Lebanon. Often possessing special ties to the regime, they terrorised the local population and ran tobacco and drugs in and out of occupied Lebanon. [11] Rami Makhlouf and Maher al-Assad used the shabiha to do the government’s “dirty work” at the start of the uprising – beating, arresting, torturing, and killing civilian protesters who criticized the government.",corruption

The son of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has denied allegations that he laundered public funds, including via a chocolate shop he co-owns in Rio.

Flávio Bolsonaro's shop was one of 24 properties raided by anti-corruption investigators earlier this week.

Other properties owned by him, his former advisors and members of President Bolsonaro's ex-wife's family were also raided.

Flávio Bolsonaro, now a senator, was a Rio state deputy from 2003 to 2018.

The investigation relates to the alleged practice of ""rachadinha"" - diverting the salaries of non-existent employees, which is alleged to have taken place during this period.

On Thursday, President Bolsonaro - who was elected after vowing to end corruption - declined to comment, saying: ""I can only answer for myself.""

Last month the president launched a new political party, the Alliance for Brazil, which he said would be dedicated to fighting corruption and advancing Christian values. Flávio Bolsonaro would be the party's vice-president, he said.

What happened in the raids?

Brazilian media have been reporting details of the investigation that were contained in a document allegedly leaked from the Rio de Janeiro prosecutor's office.

In a YouTube video, Flávio Bolsonaro criticised the supposed leak, denied all the allegations and said he was being persecuted.

""Now they are attacking my chocolate shop, which was bought with my wife's and my own resources,"" he said.

""If I wanted to launder money, would I open a franchise which is subject to external checks by the franchiser and auditors?"" he added.

He also rejected accusations that he had laundered money through the purchase of two apartments in Rio's Copacabana area.

""I bought them from a group of American investors that was leaving Brazil and obviously I was able to negotiate a better price because it was two properties from the same seller. Can't I buy it cheaper? Do I have to pay more to avoid suspicion?"" he said.

His lawyer Frederick Wassef has asked Brazil's Federal Supreme Court to suspend the investigation, Brazilian media reported.

Mr Wassef said the senator had reacted to news of the searches ""with surprise, but with complete peace"".

One of Flávio Bolsonaro's former aides, Fabrício Queiroz, is being investigated on suspicion of helping skim ghost workers' salaries, the Rio state prosecutor's office said in a statement.

Miami – Today, a federal judge in Miami sentenced 43-year-old Philip Righter, of California, to five years in prison for running a scheme in which he tried to dupe prominent art businesses, including one South Florida gallery, into spending millions of dollars on forgeries of works by renowned contemporary artists like Keith Haring and Jean-Michel Basquiat.

Ariana Fajardo Orshan, United States Attorney for the Southern District of Florida, and George L. Piro, Special Agent in Charge, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Miami Field Office, made the announcement.

Righter’s scheme was this: He would buy art forgeries at online marketplaces and auction sites. Once he had the forgeries, Righter tried to make them appear legitimate by creating letters that falsely certified their authenticity. For example, he created letters that appeared to be from “The Estate of Keith Haring” and the “Authentication Committee of the Estate of Jean-Michel Basquiat.” In fact, they were not. Righter designed and purchased embossers bearing the names of the estate and foundation for Haring and Basquiat. He stamped the forged letters with the custom embossers, trying to enhance the look of legitimacy. Righter forged the signatures of representatives of the estate and foundation on the letters.

Righter also created elaborate backstories to establish the “provenance” of the forged artworks. He forged documents to show links between the artworks, Righter’s family, a Wisconsin art museum, and a prominent New York City gallery. Righter told one prospective buyer that he had donated a number of his artworks to his Ivy League alma mater, which was a lie.

Once Righter had the forged artworks, forged documents, and false stories in place, he offered, directly and through brokers, to sell the forged works to galleries, auction houses, and others. In one instance, after a Miami gallery owner showed interest in some work, Righter (who was in Los Angeles) shipped a number of the forgeries to South Florida, where the FBI ultimately seized them. Righter’s asking price for these forgeries: $1,056,000. He directed the gallery owner to wire the money to Righter’s bank account.

Agents with FBI’s Art Crime Team uncovered Righter’s coast-to-coast scheme, which resulted in the filing of two federal cases against him -- one in the Southern District of Florida (the “Miami case”) and one in the Central District of California (the “Los Angeles case”). The Los Angeles case was transferred to Miami, where the two prosecutions were consolidated for plea and sentencing proceedings.

On March 11, 2020, Righter pled guilty to two counts in the Miami case: mail fraud and aggravated identity theft. (Case No. 19-20370-CR-Cooke). Today, Righter pled guilty in Miami federal court to three counts in the Los Angeles case: wire fraud, aggravated identity theft, and tax fraud. (Case No. 20-20164-CR-Cooke). United States District Court Judge Marcia G. Cooke sentenced Righter to five years’ imprisonment in each case. The sentences will run concurrently. A consolidated restitution hearing is set for September 30, 2020, at 10 a.m.

U.S. Attorney Fajardo Orshan commended the investigative efforts of the FBI’s Art Crime Team. Assistant United States Attorney Christopher Browne prosecuted the Miami case.

WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of the Treasury today designated Umar Siddique Kathio Azmarai (Azmarai), a senior Al-Qa’ida official, and Jamia Taleem-Ul-Quran-Wal-Hadith Madrassa, also known as the Ganj Madrassa, a school in Peshawar that serves as a training center and facilitates funding for al-Qa’ida, Lashkar-e Tayyiba, and the Taliban. The activities of the Ganj Madrassa exemplify how terrorist groups, such as al-Qa’ida, Lashkar-e Tayyiba, and the Taliban, subvert seemingly legitimate institutions, such as religious schools, to divert charitable donations meant for education to support violent acts. Today’s action is the first designation of a madrassa that is being abused by terrorist organizations. This action does not generally target madrassas, which often play an essential role in improving literacy and providing humanitarian and developmental aid in many areas of the world, including Pakistan.

“Today’s action strikes at the heart of the financial and logistical support network that abuses charitable donations and provides essential services for various terrorist groups including al-Qa’ida, Lashkar-e Tayyiba, and the Taliban. These networks provide the fighters, training, and supplies for these terrorist groups to carry out their acts of violence against coalition forces and civilians alike,” said Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence David S. Cohen. “We will continue to work with our partners around the world to dismantle these terrorist networks, especially those that try to conceal their sinister activities behind critical community organizations like madrassas.”

During his long tenure with al-Qa’ida, Azmarai has held a number of important positions. He is al-Qa’ida’s leader in Sindh and Balochistan provinces, Pakistan, and has been a significant financial facilitator for the group, moving hundreds of thousands of dollars in support of its leadership and operations. Azmarai has also acted as a courier for al-Qa’ida officials and has managed logistics for family members of senior al-Qa’ida leadership, including Usama bin Laden.

Treasury today also designated the Ganj Madrassa in Peshawar, Pakistan, which is controlled by designated al-Qa’ida facilitator Fazeel-A-Tul Shaykh Abu Mohammed Ameen Al-Peshawari, also known as Shaykh Aminullah. Shaykh Aminullah was designated by both the United States and United Nations (UN) in 2009 for providing material support to al-Qa’ida and the Taliban.

The Ganj Madrassa serves as a terrorist training center where students, under the guise of religious studies, have been radicalized to conduct terrorist and insurgent activities. In some cases, students were trained to become bomb manufacturers and suicide bombers. Shaykh Aminullah has directed donations provided for the school to terrorist groups such as the Taliban, which use the money to fund the ongoing violence in Afghanistan.

The Ganj Madrassa was designated today pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 13224, which targets terrorist and their supporters, for being controlled by Shaykh Aminullah and for providing financial and material support to Lashkar-e Tayyiba and the Taliban. Azmarai was designated pursuant to E.O. 13224 for acting on behalf of al-Qa’ida.

As a result of today’s designation, any assets these entities may have under U.S. jurisdiction are frozen, and U.S. persons are generally prohibited from doing business with them.

Umar Siddique Kathio Azmarai

In addition to his financial activities on behalf of al-Qa’ida, Azmarai has been active in multiple other facilitation duties for al-Qa’ida. As of early 2012, Azmarai facilitated the procurement of secure areas in Pakistan for al-Qa’ida to house militants and store vehicles. Azmarai has frequently acted as a courier within Pakistan for al-Qa’ida leaders and other al-Qa’ida facilitators. As of early 2003, Azmarai was a courier between al-Qa’ida cells in Pakistan and the Persian Gulf and, as of late 2002, was a courier for senior al-Qa’ida operational planner Khalid Shaykh Muhammad.

Azmarai's facilitation duties on behalf of al-Qa’ida have also included providing logistical support to al-Qa’ida members and their families. As of 2011, Azmarai assisted al-Qa’ida's administrative manager with managing the care of important al-Qa’ida members' families, including facilitating their finances, housing, and medical care. In 1999, Azmarai assisted in making logistical arrangements for al-Qa’ida members and their families in Karachi, Pakistan. Azmarai was also specifically responsible for providing support to members of now-deceased al-Qa’ida leader Usama bin Laden's family. Bin Laden's son-in-law selected Azmarai in late 1999 to look after bin Laden's family and, in mid-2000, Azmarai began working directly for bin Laden's family, facilitating their travel, lodging, and medical needs. From late 2001 through early 2002, Azmarai was responsible for bin Laden's family members in Karachi. In mid-2002, Azmarai worked for bin Laden's son, now-deceased Saad bin Laden.

Ganj Madrassa

Under Shaykh Aminullah’s leadership, the Ganj Madrassa has trained and harbored Taliban fighters who have subsequently been dispatched to Afghanistan. As recently as early 2013, Shaykh Aminullah was recruiting for Lashkar-e Tayyiba at the Ganj Madrassa and, as of late 2012, was hosting al-Qa’ida operatives there.

Shaykh Aminullah has provided assistance, including funding and recruits, to al-Qaida. In addition, he directs donations received by the Ganj Madrassa to jihadist fighters battling coalition forces in Afghanistan and also uses the money to train madrassa students to become Taliban fighters. Shaykh Aminullah frequently travels to the Gulf to obtain charity donations on the madrassa’s behalf.

A solicitor jailed last year for three money laundering offences has been struck off the roll. In an outcome agreed with the Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal, Ross Ian McKay accepted he should be banned after he was jailed for seven years for helping fraudsters develop a multi-million-pound property portfolio.

The Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal also heard McKay worked as an in-house solicitor for a company which converted money introduced by a convicted drug dealer.

McKay, from Handforth in Cheshire, was sentenced in January 2019 at Manchester Crown Court after it was heard he was gangsters’ ‘go-to’ solicitor who would carry out property transactions without asking questions about where the money had come from.

Investigators said following his sentence that McKay was fully aware that transactions were being made to launder criminal proceeds and he was deliberately dishonest in facilitating them.

The tribunal heard that the sentencing judge, His Honour Judge Smith, said McKay worked for two clients on total purchases worth more than £7.3m and assisted them in the acquisition of criminal property.

McKay was responsible for more than 80 property transactions for various criminals, all of whom were subsequently convicted of offences including money laundering and fraud.

The court had heard that deposits were put down on property where the source of funds was disguised and mortgage applications used nominees instead of the names of the legitimate purchasers.

McKay, admitted in 2004, acknowledged his conviction and did not argue against his striking off. The tribunal said he had caused significant harm to the reputation of the profession and its attempts to combat money laundering. Breaches of the law happened over several years and he had direct control over matters during this period. He must also pay £1,450 in costs.",jailed for money laundering

(CNN) Maurice Fayne, who stars in VH1's ""Love & Hip Hop: Atlanta,"" has been arrested and charged with federal bank fraud after misusing funds from a Paycheck Protection Program (""PPP"") loan, federal officials said Wednesday.

Fayne, also known as ""Arkansas Mo,"" runs a corporation called Flame Trucking, and he submitted a PPP loan application for the company on April 15, stating that the business had 107 employees and an average monthly payroll of $1,490,200, according to an affidavit for the criminal complaint.

Flame Trucking asked for a loan of $3,725,500 and certified that the loan proceeds would be used to ""retain workers and maintain payroll or make mortgage interest payments, lease payments, and utility payments, as specified under the Paycheck Protection Program Rule,"" the affidavit alleges.

United Community Bank ultimately funded the loan for $2,045,800 in late April, according to the affidavit.

Fayne then used more that $1.5 million of the funds to buy $85,000 in jewelry, including a Rolex watch, a diamond bracelet, and a 5.73 carat diamond ring for himself, the US Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Georgia said in a release.

Fayne also leased a 2019 Rolls-Royce Wraith, and paid $40,000 for child support, according to the statement.

""At a time when small businesses are struggling for survival, we cannot tolerate anyone driven by personal greed, who misdirects federal emergency assistance earmarked for keeping businesses afloat,"" said Chris Hacker, Special Agent in Charge of FBI Atlanta, in the statement.

An attorney for Fayne pointed to the ""considerable confusion"" about PPP guidelines when asked by CNN about the charges against her client.

""There has been considerable confusion among small business owners about PPP guidelines -- particularly around the question of whether and how business owners are permitted to pay themselves a salary or take an owner's draw. I hope these issues to be better fleshed out in the weeks and months to come,"" attorney Tanya Miller said in a statement.

""For obvious reasons, we cannot try these allegations in the media,"" Miller said. ""We will provide the appropriate response in the proper forum once all the information has been provided to us.""

The PPP loan program from the federal government aims to help small businesses and their workers survive during the Covid-19 pandemic. The loans are for businesses with 500 or fewer employees to pay workers' salaries, rent and utility costs.

In an interview with federal agents last week, Fayne said he used the PPP loan to ""pay payroll and other business expenses"" of the company, and ""Fayne expressly denied that he used any of the PPP loan proceeds to pay his personal debts,"" according to the court document.

Federal agents searched Fayne's residence in Dacula, Georgia, May 11, where they also discovered about $80,000 in cash, including $9,400 that Fayne had in his pockets, court documents say.

Fayne told the agents that he had used the PPP loan to buy the jewelry, and when asked if he had used any of the loan on the Rolls- Royce, he said, ""Kinda, sorta, not really,"" according to the affidavit.

As Vladimir Putin returns to office for a fourth term, criticism is bubbling back up over former German chancellor Gerhard Schroeder’s close relationship with the Russian president.

A spokesman for current chancellor Angela Merkel yesterday (March 19) had to reject the suggestion that the EU sanction Schroeder for supporting Putin while the German was chancellor, and then taking well-paid jobs by the Russian state after leaving office. Earlier in the day, Ukraine’s foreign minister Pavlo Klimkin had backed a call for sanctions made in a Wall Street Journal op-ed (paywall) during the weekend.

“It is important that there are sanctions against those who promote Putin’s projects abroad,” Klimkin told the German newspaper Bild. “Schroeder is the most important lobbyist for Putin worldwide. So it should be examined how the EU can act here.”

The two men’s relationship is so notorious that it has spawned a word used by political analysts and human rights activists in three languages: “Schroederization” in English, “Schröderisierung” in German, and “Schroederizatsia” (“Шрёдеризация”) in Russian. In English and Russian, “it means ‘the corruption of a political elite in another country,'” said Boris Reitschuster, a German former Moscow correspondent and author of Putin’s Hidden War, at PutinCon, a gathering of the world’s biggest Kremlin critics on March 16.

In German, the word seems to have extra nuances. While some use it to refer to corruption, one politician from Merkel’s Christian Democrats recently employed it to describe a closeness to the Kremlin. He appealed (link in German) to Schroeder’s old Social Democratic Party to not develop uncomfortably close ties to Moscow or help Kremlin propaganda, which he characterized a potential “Schroederization.”

The phrase has been attributed to Edward Lucas, a hawkish former Moscow correspondent for The Economist, but Lucas says former Estonian president Toomas Hendrik Ilves coined the word.

Schroeder and Putin go way back, first becoming close as two alpha-male European leaders in the early 2000s. Just before the German was ejected from office after losing his 2005 re-election campaign to Merkel, he gave Putin a parting gift: approval of the Kremlin’s controversial Nord Stream pipeline. The project directed Russian gas into Europe via Germany, upping Moscow’s leverage over the continent. (Russia had previously relied on a route through Ukraine, which was a source of various disputes between the two countries, often leading to Moscow temporarily shutting off the pipeline.) Straight after his election defeat, Schroeder took a well-remunerated job as chairman of the project. After its completion, he became chair of its second iteration, Nord Stream 2, and last year was named chairman of Russia’s state-owned oil giant Rosneft.

Bad bromance?

The two men share more than just a passion for Russian oil and gas expansion, though. They’ve long enjoyed having a good hug.

Like that time in April 2001.

And September 2001.

And November 2001.

And December 2001.

The AP and Reuters have no documented hugs in 2002. But the news organizations caught Schroeder and Putin finding each other again in October 2003.

And their wives awkwardly watching the two connect again in April 2004.

The two men found a furtive corner in July 2005.

By October 2005, they’d got that walking side-hug down.

After Schroeder left office in November 2005, the press wasn’t around as much to document any potential embraces. But in 2014, just after Putin’s annexation of Crimea, the European Press Association snapped him giving Schroeder a cuddle in St Petersburg on the German’s 70th birthday. The German media wasn’t impressed.",corruption

MIAMI (AP) — A California man was sentenced Wednesday to five years in federal prison for trying to sell forged art to a South Florida gallery.

A federal judge in Miami sentenced Philip Righter, 43, who pleaded guilty in March to mail fraud and aggravated identity theft, according to court records.

Righter’s scheme involved buying forgeries of artists like Jean-Michel Basquiat, Keith Haring, Roy Lichtenstein and Andy Warhol, investigators said. He made the forgeries appear legitimate by creating letters that falsely certified their authenticity and elaborate backstories to establish their provenance and then offered them to galleries, auction houses and others.

In the South Florida case, Righter sent several forgeries from Los Angeles to a Miami gallery. He was asking more than $1 million for the forgeries, which were seized by the FBI. In total, Righter’s scheme attempted to scam victims out of more than $6 million and caused losses of more than $750,000.

Righter pleaded guilty Wednesday to additional counts of wire fraud, aggravated identity theft and tax fraud for a Los Angeles case. He received an additional five years for that case, but the two sentences will run concurrently. The tax fraud totaled more than $100,000.

A consolidated restitution hearing is set for Sept. 30.",

North Korean hackers stole around $250 million in cryptocurrency from an exchange and then enlisted Chinese nationals to help launder more than $100 million of it, say US authorities.

The US Department of Justice has charged Tian Yinyin and Li Jiadong with laundering cryptocurrency believed to have been stolen from an unnamed exchange in 2018 by the North Korean government-linked Lazarus Group.

A civil forfeiture complaint says that after stealing the money, the hackers laundered it through hundreds of automated cryptocurrency transactions designed to prevent authorities tracing it. They used doctored photos and fake IDs to get past KYC controls.

Some of the haul was used to pay for infrastructure used in North Korean hacking campaigns against the financial industry. A UN report last year estimated that the country has generated an estimated $2 billion in revenues for its weapons programme through the state-sponsored looting of financial institutions and cryptocurrency exchanges.

In addition to the $250 million 2018 hack, the North Koreans are said to be behind a 2019 attack on a South Korean exchange that netted $48.5 million.

Yinyin and Jiadong are accused by the DoJ of helping to launder about $100 million. Among their techniques, they converted about $1.4 million of Bitcoin into prepaid Apple iTunes gift cards. They are charged with money laundering conspiracy and operating an unlicensed money transmitting business.

The civil forfeiture complaint names 113 virtual currency accounts and addresses from which the US is trying to recover funds, a portion of which has already been seized.

Assistant Attorney General Brian Benczkowski says: “These defendants allegedly laundered over a hundred million dollars worth of stolen cryptocurrency to obscure transactions for the benefit of actors based in North Korea.

“Today's actions underscore that the Department will pierce the veil of anonymity provided by cryptocurrencies to hold criminals accountable, no matter where they are located.”",money laundering

Carl Icahn, billionaire activist investor and former advisor to President Donald Trump, made headlines in recent days for having sold off shares of Manitowoc Company (MTW) ahead of an announcement by the Trump administration that new tariffs would take effect.

Shares of the crane manufacturing company dropped 4.8% on February 16, shortly after Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross released the ""Steel and Aluminum 232"" reports on the same day, according to CNBC. These reports suggested a global tariff of 24% or more on all steel imports. (See also: Which Stocks Will Win or Lose From Steel, Aluminum Tariffs?)

Icahn's move has been questioned by some analysts, who claim the billionaire mogul may have acted on insider information. Icahn has responded to the allegations by saying they're ""categorically untrue.""

'Legitimate Investment Reasons'

A statement from representatives for Icahn said ""the recent media speculation regarding our sale of Manitowoc stock calls for a response. We state for the record:

""Any suggestion that we had prior knowledge of the Trump administration's announcement of new tariffs on steel imports is categorically untrue. We reduced our position in Manitowoc for legitimate investment reasons having nothing to do with that announcement.""

Manitowoc and other construction equipment manufacturers rely heavily on steel in their manufacturing work. The fact that Icahn sold off shares just before the announcement and the drop in the company's stock price looked suspicious to some critics, who assumed that he must have known the tariff announcement was coming. No one has come forward with any evidence of these claims.

Icahn Sold One-Third of Stake

According to a filing with the SEC, investment entities which Icahn controls sold off one-third of all their stock in Manitowoc between February 12th and February 22 of this year. This decrease in position amounted to roughly 940,000 shares, sold at $32 to $34 per share, for a total of roughly $31 million.

Despite the massive sell-off, even after shedding almost a million shares, Icahn still owns 4.85% of MTW, which is down from his previous stake of 7.5%. Icahn was special advisor on regulation to the Trump administration, although he resigned from the position in August 2017.

MTW stock suffered an immediate 4.8% drop after Secretary Ross' announcement. It then fell another 6% last week after President Trump announced plans to impose a 25% tariff on steel and 10% on aluminum.

Allegations of insider trading are not taken lightly by regulators. Billionaire Steven A. Cohen was implicated in insider trading activities associated with a hedge fund he controlled and was subsequently banned from trading outside investor money for several years. There has been no further information about an ongoing investigation in Icahn's case, however.",insider trading
TMML2024031330595,Bernard Ebbers,"Alert ID: TMML2024031330595
The former chief of WorldCom, convicted in one of the largest corporate accounting scandals in U.S. history, died just over a month after his early release from prison. Bernard Ebbers was 78.

The Canadian-born former telecommunications executive died Sunday in Brookhaven, Mississippi, surrounded by his family, according to a family statement.

WorldCom Inc. collapsed and went into bankruptcy in 2002, following revelations of an $11 billion accounting fraud that included pressure by top executives on subordinates to inflate numbers to make the company seem more profitable. The collapse caused losses to stockholders, including those who had invested through retirement plans.

Ebbers was convicted in New York in 2005 on securities fraud and other charges and received a 25-year sentence. A federal appeals court judge who upheld Ebbers' conviction in 2006 wrote that WorldCom's fraudulent accounting practices were ""specifically intended to create a false picture of profitability even for professional analysts that, in Ebbers' case, was motivated by his personal financial circumstances.""

Before establishing himself in telecommunications, Ebbers had a diverse career that started in sports. He received a basketball scholarship at Mississippi College, where he majored in physical education. After graduating, he coached high school teams for a year before investing in a hotel; he eventually amassed a chain of Best Westerns in Mississippi and Texas, as well as a car dealership in Columbia, Mississippi.

Following the advice of friends and knowing little about the phone business, he invested in a small long-distance company, LDDS, in 1983. He eventually took over the day-to-day operations and bought up competitors, transforming LDDS — which was later renamed WorldCom, based in Clinton, Mississippi — into the fourth-largest long-distance company by 1996.

He was considered to be a ""no-nonsense"" man with a brash attitude who preferred jeans to a suit. One analyst cited in an early profile in the late nineties said Bernie Ebbers was ""the telephone equivalent of Bill Gates.""

By the time of its collapse over its accounting fraud scandal in 2002, WorldCom was the nation's second-largest long-distance business. Ebbers left that year and following his conviction, was imprisoned from September 2006 until Dec. 21, when he was released from the custody of the Bureau of Prisons.

In the meantime, WorldCom reemerged as MCI, taken over by Verizon, and relocated to Ashburn, Virginia.

U.S. District Judge Valerie E. Caproni said late last year that it fell within her discretion to order the early release of Ebbers after a lawyer cited severe medical problems and said that Ebbers had experienced severe weight loss. At over 6 feet tall, he had dropped in weight from above 200 pounds to 147 pounds. Attorney Graham Carner told the judge it was possible his client might not live another 18 months.

Among other ailments, Ebbers had heart disease, Carner said. Ebbers was not in court when Caproni announced her ruling on Dec. 18; his lawyers said he was hospitalized.

""While Mr. Ebbers is physically alive ... his quality of life is gone,"" Carner said in December. ""If he was released today, Mr. Ebbers is not going to be playing tennis or running a business.""

In court papers in September, his lawyers said Ebbers unintentionally bumped into another prisoner while walking in the facility in September of 2017, only to have the prisoner go to Ebbers' open cell later in the day and physically attack him.

The papers said the attack fractured the bones around Ebbers' eyes and caused blunt head trauma and other injuries. They also said Ebbers was put into solitary confinement because his ""severely limited eyesight"" made him unable to identify the attacker.

In July 2019, one of Ebbers' daughters submitted a request that her father receive compassionate release from a federal prison medical facility in Fort Worth, Texas. Court papers say a Bureau of Prisons official denied that request in August. The family statement said that the Bureau of Prisons ""had no diagnosis or treatment plan in place"" and Ebbers experienced a ""rapid decline"" in October, followed by multiple hospitalizations in November and December.

While prosecutors agreed that Ebbers' health had deteriorated in prison, they opposed an early release. Assistant U.S. Attorney Jason Cowley told the judge that such a move would send ""a terrible message to the rule of law"" because it would cut Ebbers' sentence in half.

The family statement acknowledged resistance to Ebbers' early release from victims of WorldCom's collapse, but said that many victims also expressed their support.

""Many stockholders and employees lost their investments in the fall of WorldCom. Many of our friends — and many in our family — did too,"" the statement read. ""Thankfully, Judge Caproni agreed with us — keeping Dad in prison, especially in his unexplained and undiagnosed deteriorated condition, would not bring back anyone's investments.""

The family said they would pray for the victims. The statement, which repeatedly praised Caproni, said family members plan to eventually advocate for others ""who are deserving of compassionate release to their families.""",accounting fraud

WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) today designated Afghan national Pahlawan Rozi, pursuant to the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act (Kingpin Act), for his significant role in international narcotics trafficking.

Rozi, a weapons and narcotics trafficker and hawala owner in northern Afghanistan, smuggles drugs across the Tajikistan-Afghanistan border. Through his narcotics trafficking activities, Rozi has acquired large amounts of money and assets, including buildings, businesses, and orchards in Kunduz Province. He has also bribed and made payments to high-ranking Afghan Government officials to avoid police interference in his narcotics trafficking activities.

​

“R​ozi’s role as a hawaladar and narcotics trafficker has incited violence and fueled crime throughout the Afghan region,” said OFAC Director Adam J. Szubin. “Treasury will not tolerate these illicit activities, which undermine confidence in the legitimate financial system, and we will continue to target and expose criminals like Rozi.”

This designation is the result of collaboration between Treasury, the Drug Enforcement Administration, and the Afghanistan Threat Finance Cell (ATFC). The ATFC, which is based in Afghanistan, collects, analyzes, and disseminates intelligence reporting on Afghan insurgent financing.

As a result of today’s action, all property and interests in property in the United States or in the possession or control of U.S. persons in which Rozi has an interest is blocked, and U.S. persons are generally prohibited from engaging in transactions with him.

Today’s action is part of Treasury's ongoing efforts to apply financial sanctions against significant foreign narcotics traffickers and their organizations. Since June 2000, the OFAC has designated more than 1,400 individuals and entities pursuant to the Kingpin Act. Kingpin Act violations may result in the imposition of civil fines and criminal penalties. Criminal penalties for corporate officers may include up to 30 years in prison and fines up to $5 million while criminal fines for corporations may reach $10 million. Criminal penalties for other individuals may include up to 10 years in prison and fines pursuant to Title 18 of the United States Code for criminal violations of the Kingpin Act.

The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, on Tuesday, February 27, 2018, arraigned Nanle Miracle Dariye, son of former Plateau State Governor, Joshua Dariye, on a 6-count charge of money laundering to the tune of N1.5billion before Justice Ijeoma Ojukwu of the Federal High Court, Abuja.

Dariye was arraigned alongside Apartment le Paradis, an hotel where he was a director.

The defendant sometime in 2013 failed to report a cash transaction to the tune of N1.5billion which he received through the hotel’s account in one of the old generation banks. The amount is above the threshold of the N10million permissible by law. Additionally, the hotel was also not registered as Designated Non-Financial Institution, DNFI.

The offence is in contravention of Section 5(1) (a) of the Money Laundering Prohibition Act, 2011 as amended and punishable under Section 5 (b) of the same Act.

Count two of the charge reads:

“That you, Nanle Miracle Dariye, while being a Director of Apartment le Paradis Limited and Apartment le Paradis Limited on 28 th day of March 2013 in Abuja within the Jurisdiction of this Honorable Court did commit an offence to wit: Failure to report within 7 (seven) days, a cash transaction in the sum of N551,555,428.50 (Five Hundred and Fifty One Million, Five Hundred and Fifty Five Thousand Four Hundred and Twenty Eight Naira, Fifty Kobo) paid to Apartment le Paradis Limited BY BGL Securities Ltd vide your First Bank Plc Account No 2014165731 on 28 th day of March 2013 which is above the threshold of N10,000,000 (Ten million Naira) and you hereby committed an offence contrary to Section 10(1) of the Money Laundering (Prohibition) Act, 2011 as amended and punishable under Section 10 (3) of the same Act"".

The defendant pleaded not guilty to the charge when they were read to him.

In view of his plea, counsel to the EFCC, George Adebola, asked the court to fix a date for trial and for the defendant to be remanded in prison custody.

However, Dariye’s counsel, Charles Abalaka, pleaded that he was yet to file application for bail as he was served with the charge late yesterday. He urged the court to admit his client to bail, while presenting two sureties - Mr. Amana Yusuf, a Grade Level 12 civil servant working with Ministry of Defence and Mrs. Rose, a Grade Level 13 officer working in the Office of the Head of Service in Abuja.

Justice Ojukwu admitted the defendant to bail in the sum of N5million with two sureties in like sum. The sureties must be resident of Abuja and must provide tax evidences for 2015, 2016 and 2017.

The judge, thereafter, adjourned to April 10 -12, 2018 for commencement of trial.

Prosecutors in Brazil filed charges against Agriculture Minister Blairo Maggi on Wednesday, accusing him of orchestrating a bribery scheme in 2009 when he was governor of Mato Grosso state.

Prosecutor General Raquel Dodge filed charges at the Supreme Court, according to a written statement from the federal prosecutor's office.

Maggi denies any wrongdoing, the press office of the agriculture minister said in a written statement.

Under Brazilian law, Maggi, as a government minister, can only face a trial if the Supreme Court approves it. There was no indication on Wednesday as to when the court would make a decision, Reuters reports.

Dodge accused Maggi of participating in a scheme to pay a judge on the Mato Grosso state audit court US$3.4 million in public funds to retire, so that Sergio Ricardo de Almeida, who was a Mato Grosso state lawmaker, could take the post, which he did.

John McAfee, the controversial founder of the anti-virus company that carries his name, was arrested on Saturday at Barcelona’s El Prat airport due to allegations of, among other offenses, evading millions of dollars of taxes on supposed income from activities such as promoting cryptocurrencies.

The United States Department of Justice announced on Monday all of the charges that McAfee is facing, and explained that they are awaiting for the extradition process from Spain to be completed, according to British daily the Financial Times, and which was later confirmed to EL PAÍS by sources from the Spanish High Court, the Audiencia Nacional. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has also leveled accusations against McAfee in a civil court.

The eccentric millionaire was apprehended at the Spanish airport at 9.30am when he was due to take a flight to Istanbul, according to police sources. When his passport details were checked, officers discovered that there was an international warrant out for his arrest on accusations of fraud. He was arrested on the spot.

On Sunday, McAfee was brought before a court and was questioned by a judge via videoconference. When the testimony concluded, the magistrate ordered him to be held in custody while his extradition order was processed. The entrepreneur is currently being held in Brians prison, in Sant Esteve Sesrovire, Barcelona.

The American businessman is accused of hiding millions of dollars of income from US tax authorities for the promotion of cryptocurrencies and the sale of the rights to his life story, the Financial Times reported. Public prosecutors believe that the businessman used accounts in other people’s names to hide this income, which was obtained between 2014 and 2018. The US authorities also accuse him of acquiring assets, including a yacht, using other people’s names.

Since McAfee sold his antivirus company to Intel for €6.5 billion at the start of the previous decade, he has had a number of run-ins with the law. In 2012, he fled from the authorities after the death of his neighbor in Belize. He took refuge in neighboring Guatemala and was later deported to the US, although he was never charged in relation to the case.

In 2019, McAfee himself announced that he had fled the United States because he was facing accusations from the public prosecutor. Last year, speaking to a news agency from Cuba, he stated that he had not paid taxes for the last eight years. “I have not paid taxes for eight years. I will not pay taxes again – it is unconstitutional and illegal,” he said. He was also arrested in July 2019 in Dominican Republic for carrying weapons on his yacht.

According to the Department of Justice, he did not pay taxes for five years, between 2014 and 2018. The investigation was opened in June, but had remained sealed until his arrest. The SEC has brought civil charges against McAfee, saying he has promoted the purchase of cryptocurrencies among his followers on Twitter without warning that he was being paid for that promotion. According to the market watchdog, he was paid more than €19.5 million for the tweets. His bodyguard, Jimmy Watson, is also being investigated. If convicted of all charges, McAfee could face up to 30 years in prison, British daily The Independent reported.

Last March, when the coronavirus pandemic took hold, McAfee found himself in Tarragona, Spain, from where he began chronicling his experiences under the strict lockdown implemented in the country, complaining that the restrictions on mobility prevented him from doing what he wanted. He spoke about “martial law” and also complained about the alarmism about a virus that, he claimed, killed fewer people than the ordinary flu. He published a series of videos in which he could be clearly seen ignoring Spain’s lockdown rules.",

SAN DIEGO – Rabbi Yisroel Goldstein, former director at Chabad of Poway, and five of his associates pleaded guilty in federal court today and Monday to fraud charges, admitting that they participated in a complex, years-long, multi-million dollar tax-evasion scheme and other financial deceptions involving theft of public money.

According to his plea agreement, while Rabbi Goldstein was director of the Poway synagogue, he received at least $6.2 million in phony contributions to the Chabad and affiliated charities and secretly refunded up to 90 percent of the donations to the “donors.” After Rabbi Goldstein provided these donors with fake receipts, they illegally claimed huge tax deductions for these nonexistent donations, and the rabbi kept about 10 percent – more than half a million dollars over the course of the fraud - for himself. Tax losses to the IRS were more than $1.5 million. At least 20 taxpayers were involved in this and related tax-evasion schemes.

This case was under investigation for more than two years before Rabbi Goldstein was shot and wounded during the April 27, 2019 attack on worshippers at the Chabad. In that case, federal civil rights and hate crimes charges are pending against John T. Earnest of Rancho Peñasquitos.

The rabbi was aware of the investigation at the time of the shooting. FBI and IRS agents had searched his home in October of 2018, and he began cooperating with the investigation shortly after that time.

According to his plea agreement, Rabbi Goldstein has agreed to cooperate with ongoing investigations of uncharged co-conspirators and to forfeit $1 million in proceeds and pay restitution of $2.5 million.

“This case has brought us all a great deal of anguish because of the attack on Chabad of Poway,” said U.S. Attorney Robert Brewer. “But whatever a defendant’s dire personal circumstances, or stature in the community, we will always seek justice, first and foremost. We cannot, and will not, sweep serious criminal conduct under the rug. We cannot look the other way because a perpetrator of crime has suddenly become a victim of crime.”

“This case shows the FBI’s dedication to untangling the web of fraud in a complex, multi-million dollar charitable donation scheme that violated the trust of the Chabad of Poway and defrauded the United States government,"" said FBI San Diego Acting Special Agent-in-Charge Omer Meisel. “The FBI is committed to holding those accountable who use their position and stature in the community as a disguise to commit fraud. All the defendants in this case, including Rabbi Yisroel Goldstein, have admitted their guilt in these fraudulent schemes and will no longer be able to use deceit and lies to cheat those who were intended to receive charitable funds and taxpayer dollars.”

“The Chabad of Poway, which has served its community for decades, was used by Rabbi Yisroel Goldstein and the five co-defendants to evade over $1.5 million in taxes over the last 8 years,” said Ryan L. Korner, Special Agent in Charge of the IRS’s Criminal Investigation Division. “The Chabad was further victimized in April 2019 when a shooter attacked its worshippers, and we recognize the pain that terrible event has caused for the Chabad, Rabbi Goldstein, and the community. Ultimately, the financial fraud schemes uncovered during this multi-year, multi-defendant investigation were egregious and IRS Criminal Investigation has a responsibility to bring to justice those who exploit and manipulate non-profit and religious organizations in order to benefit themselves. The IRS is responsible for protecting honest taxpayers and serving the public by ensuring the integrity of our tax system, which funds our nation’s critical infrastructures and vital programs, including supporting our citizens and small businesses during the ongoing pandemic. The hard work of our Special Agents will not stop despite the ongoing challenges posed by Covid-19. We will continue to work alongside our law enforcement partners, and this week’s six guilty pleas demonstrate our collective efforts to continue to enforce the law and ensure the public trust.”

Five others who participated in the scheme with Rabbi Goldstein also entered guilty pleas in federal court this week, admitting that they knowingly participated by concealing their donations through the Chabad and making false deductions on their tax forms, or by recruiting new taxpayers to participate in the scheme. One taxpayer, defendant Bruce Baker, admitted that he began participating in this scheme with Rabbi Goldstein in the 1980s, and made millions of dollars in fictitious donations over the years.

Rabbi Goldstein admitted today that in one instance in late 2017, he attempted to disguise the source of more than $1.1 million in fraudulent donations by purchasing gold coins worth approximately $1 million. He then delivered the gold to the phony donor.

There were many schemes within the broader tax-fraud and kickback scheme, dating back to 2010 or earlier and continuing through 2018.

Rabbi Goldstein admitted he defrauded three different Fortune 500 companies by tricking them into matching supposed charitable donations of their employees. Working with the employees, Rabbi Goldstein fabricated fake receipts and then secretly returned their fake “donations.” This allowed the employees to claim tax deductions for the completely fabricated donations, and allowed Rabbi Goldstein to collect the companies’ matching funds—including some that matched double their employees’ donations. Rabbi Goldstein helped to orchestrate this scheme with at least six taxpayer-employees and two other associates who helped recruit new donors or conceal the true recipient of the funds. In total, Rabbi Goldstein defrauded the companies out of at least $134,000, and helped the taxpayer-employees to claim nearly as much in fictitious tax-deductible charitable contributions to the IRS.

Rabbi Goldstein admitted that he also helped an individual conceal more than $700,000 in income by allowing the individual to use Chabad bank accounts to deposit his income, thereby hiding it from the IRS. As his cut, Rabbi Goldstein kept 10 percent of this individual’s income—more than $70,000.

Separate and apart from the tax evasion scheme, Rabbi Goldstein and defendant Alexander Avergoon, who also pleaded guilty today, used false information and fabricated invoices and other records to pretend to be eligible for emergency funds, grants or donations, and private loans. These frauds on the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the California Governor’s Office of Emergency Services (Cal OES), and private foundations resulted in losses to these programs of at least $875,000. Rabbi Goldstein and Avergoon have agreed to pay restitution to recoup these losses and reimburse these programs.

The rabbi also admitted in his plea agreement that he defrauded San Diego County courts by falsely certifying that co-conspirators and associates had performed volunteer work at the Chabad or its affiliated entities, so that those associates could submit fake reports to the courts that they had fulfilled sentencing requirements for criminal offenses showing dozens or even hundreds of community service hours. Finally, Rabbi Goldstein admitted that, along with Avergoon, he fraudulently obtained loans from banks and mortgage lending businesses by submitting false information in loan applications that they verified for one another.

“Sadly, the facts of this case show a willful, devious effort to deceive on the part of a trusted community leader,” Brewer said. “Evading taxes causes harm not just to the government, but also to one’s fellow citizens, who are forced to bear a heavier burden. Members of the Chabad of Poway are also victims of this crime, for those fake donations certainly did not benefit their congregation.

“There is no doubt that Rabbi Goldstein was the victim of a heinous hate crime that terrorized him and Chabad congregants,” Brewer said. “This is a mitigating factor, but this is no excuse. We acknowledge the rabbi’s cooperation and his community leadership in the wake of the shooting. But this illegal conduct had been going on for many years, and it cannot be ignored.”

U.S. Magistrate Judge Karen S. Crawford presided over today’s arraignment and guilty plea. Rabbi Goldstein is next scheduled to appear at a sentencing hearing on October 19, 2020 at 9 a.m. before U.S. District Judge Cynthia Bashant.

The five related guilty pleas involve a series of fraud and tax evasion schemes by Rabbi Goldstein’s co‑defendants:

1. Defendant Alexander Avergoon

Avergoon admitted that from 2010 to 2015, he recruited at least nine taxpayers who made more than $275,000 in fraudulent “donations” to the Chabad, then used Avergoon as a conduit to secretly return 90 percent of the money to the purported “donors.” He also admitted that he joined Rabbi Goldstein in the grant fraud scam in which they obtained hundreds of thousands of dollars in misappropriated grant funds.

As part of the government benefits fraud scheme, Avergoon used shell companies, including “Imagination Construction Company,” to create fictitious and backdated invoices for services like carpet installation, repairs to the Chabad of Poway’s HVAC system, and replacing damaged books and other supplies—even though Avergoon had never performed these services. In some cases, Avergoon would give Goldstein several fake bids from different shell companies, so that Rabbi Goldstein could trick the grant program administrators into believing he had complied with their competitive bidding requirements. Avergoon and Goldstein pretended that the government grant funds would be used for facilities upgrades, security systems, and community programs. But in reality, the money often went straight to Goldstein’s and Avergoon’s pockets; other times they used portions of it to pay contractors who had in fact charged much lower prices than reflected on Avergoon’s phony paperwork.

Apart from his fraudulent partnership with Rabbi Goldstein, Avergoon also admitted to participating in separate real estate Ponzi schemes from 2010 to 2016, in which he cheated retirement investors out of a total of $12 million. Avergoon was a San Diego-based real estate agent, and he used his industry knowledge and reputation to target trusting victims who would invest in what they thought was the purchase of rental property. Avergoon promised monthly dividends that would be paid from rental income. He created written investment materials like prospectus and projected income and expenses calculations, designed to give investors the false impression that their money would be safely tucked away in passive-income retirement investments. But in truth, instead of using investors’ money to buy rental properties as he promised, Avergoon spent the money himself and just pretended that he had purchased the apartment buildings and office space he advertised. In true Ponzi fashion, for a time, Avergoon made the promised dividend payments—but rather than using rent income, he funded those payments using new investor money.

Avergoon deceived more than a dozen unwitting investors, and convinced them to part with at least $5 million. When an investor would ask to cash out, he encouraged them to re-invest, and at one point he pretended to “roll over” their retirement investments to purchase a multi-million dollar commercial building. In reality, he bought that building with a loan, not with investor money, and again diverted their money to his own personal use. He created fake partnership agreements, false purchase documents and deeds, and other fictitious records, and forged the signatures of his investors to conceal the fraud—then laundered the proceeds in order to disguise the true source and ownership of the money.

Avergoon did not stop there. He convinced investors to part with another $5 million or more by pretending to use their money to fund short-term, low-risk loans supposedly secured by the borrowers’ high-end San Diego homes. But in reality, there were no “borrowers”—Avergoon used his real estate connections to identify homes he could pose as collateral, and he simply doctored up fake loan agreements and forged the borrowers’ signatures. In some cases, the individuals he claimed were the borrowers did not even own the homes that were purportedly used as collateral. Avergoon made fake loan agreements, Deeds of Trust, mortgage Notes, and other official-looking documents, and he even created fake notary stamps and San Diego County Recorder’s Office markings to make the paperwork appear legitimate. Once again, Avergoon used new investor money to make occasional payments to his victims, to make it appear that the “loans” were performing. But in truth, he diverted the money to his own use and the “investments” were worthless.

Avergoon was indicted in August 2019 and apprehended in Latvia. He was extradited to the United States in November 2019 and has remained in custody since his extradition and initial appearance in federal court in San Diego. U.S. Magistrate Judge Barbara L. Major presided over his change of plea hearing today. Avergoon is next scheduled to appear at a sentencing hearing on October 19, 2020 at 9 a.m. before U.S. District Judge Cynthia Bashant.

2. Defendant Bruce Baker

Bruce Baker pleaded guilty to conspiring with Rabbi Goldstein to defraud the IRS and file false tax returns beginning as early as the mid-1980s. For three decades, Baker admitted that he used fabricated records from Goldstein to fraudulently reduce his tax liabilities by pretending he was eligible for tax deductions for millions of dollars in nonexistent “gifts to charity” he reportedly made to the Chabad. In reality, Goldstein secretly returned 90 percent of Baker’s donations, and kept a 10 percent fee.

This part of the scheme was especially complex and intricate. Rather than simply paying cash or returning Baker’s money in direct payments, Goldstein would pay Baker’s creditors, make large purchases on his behalf, give money to Baker’s relatives, or pay off bills on behalf of his family. To disguise the repayments, Rabbi Goldstein delivered the money in clandestine ways by, for example, paying:

around $200,000 to Baker’s business partner to buy the partner’s share of their business assets on Baker’s behalf;
more than $420,000 in tuition and fees for Baker’s son to attend dental school and a post-doctoral residency in dentistry;
at least $90,000 to a construction company for Baker’s benefit, another $200,000 directly to a building contractor working for Baker and $129,000 to a home builder, and more than $300,000 to Baker’s account at a construction and building supply company; and
$200,000 from the proceeds of the sale of Goldstein’s property paid directly to Baker’s son.

Over the years, Baker admitted that he “donated” at least $2.6 million to Chabad of Poway, with at least $2.4 million secretly funneled back from Goldstein to Baker. In total, Baker’s and Goldstein’s scheme cost the IRS around $644,000 in tax losses.

Separate from his dealings with Rabbi Goldstein, Baker also admitted that he engaged in a similar tax evasion scheme with the director of a separate religious congregation and community organization in San Diego. In 2006, that individual offered Baker and his family an arrangement where they would pretend to make an “in-kind” donation to the religious organization of an ancient Iranian Torah—although no such Torah existed and the “in-kind” donation was a hoax. This other director provided Baker with a fraudulent appraisal that valued the Torah at $1.2 million. Baker and his family used the fake paperwork to claim exorbitant tax deductions, and gave the co-conspirator a 10 percent fee—or $120,000—in return. On top of that, the director charged Baker $20,000 for the fake appraisal.

U.S. Magistrate Judge Karen S. Crawford presided over Baker’s arraignment and guilty plea on July 13, 2020. Baker is scheduled for sentencing on October 19, 2020, at 9 a.m. before U.S. District Judge Cynthia Bashant. He has agreed to make full restitution to the IRS including all unpaid taxes, penalties, and interest.

3. Defendant Bijan Moossazadeh

Bijan Moossazadeh began participating in the tax evasion scheme with Rabbi Goldstein as early as 2012. As he admitted in his plea agreement, between 2012 and 2018 he pretended to “donate” a total of around $290,000 to Chabad of Poway. But instead of using the money for charitable purposes, Goldstein secretly funneled back 90 percent of the funds to Moossazadeh. Even so, Goldstein generated fraudulent donation receipt letters for Moossazadeh, so he could fraudulently verify that the money was indeed a “gift to charity.” Moossazadeh fraudulently reduced his tax liability—or intended to, before he learned of this investigation in 2018—by more than $91,500.

Goldstein concealed his repayments by giving Moossazadeh large cash payments that would be difficult to trace. And he communicated in code when he had cash available, referring to his cash supplies as “challah” and his supplier as “the baker.” In 2016, for example, Goldstein texted Moossazadeh to tell him he had cash: “I got a call from the Baker today he’s preparing for Friday how many Chalah do you need?” Moossazadeh answered, “22”—by which he meant, $22,000. The next day, Goldstein followed up: “Good morning[.] The baker came in earlier and has today 22 challa ready for pickup[.] Let me know what time?” Moossazadeh met Rabbi Goldstein at the Chabad on March 16, 2016, where he delivered a $22,000 check made payable to the Chabad (with “Contribution” written in the memo line), and in exchange Goldstein gave him $20,000 in cash (keeping the remaining $2,000). Goldstein also gave Moossazadeh a fraudulent donation receipt thanking Defendant for his “generous tax deductible donation.”

They followed a similar pattern in 2018, when Goldstein again used coded text messages to alert Moossazadeh that he did not have cash ready and available: “Just got a call the baker is not baking challah this Friday-will be back next Friday and have the full order.” A week later, Goldstein followed up: “Cook just finished . [] Come and pickup[.]” Moossazadeh admitted in his plea agreement that he met Goldstein at the Chabad the next day and delivered a check for $33,000, made payable to the Chabad (again with “Contribution” written in the memo line). In exchange, Goldstein gave Moossazadeh $30,000 in cash (keeping the remaining $3,000), along with another fraudulent donation receipt.

In August 2018—just at the time that court documents show Goldstein had offered to launder cash proceeds for an individual who he only later discovered was an undercover federal agent--—Rabbi Goldstein let Moossazadeh know he had more cash available. He texted Moossazadeh: “I have a new baker who can bake many more challah almost unlimited[.] Let Joe [SHEMIRANI] know that a new baker came to town and to let me know how many challah to bake ? Can do as many as you need .. unlimited[.]” But just a few months later in October 2018, Moossazadeh learned that Rabbi Goldstein was under investigation. He did not attempt to deduct any of his 2018 purported donations to the Chabad.

U.S. Magistrate Judge Karen S. Crawford presided over Moossazadeh’s arraignment and guilty plea on July 13, 2020. He is scheduled for sentencing on October 19, 2020, at 9 a.m. before U.S. District Judge Cynthia Bashant. He has agreed to make full restitution to the IRS including all unpaid taxes, penalties (including a 75 percent fraud penalty), and interest.

4. Defendant Yousef Shemirani

Yousef Shemirani admitted in his plea agreement that he participated in the tax scheme from 2011 to 2016, and in total he pretended to “donate” $137,650 to Rabbi Goldstein and the Chabad of Poway. In return, Goldstein secretly funneled approximately 90 percent of the “donations” back to Shemirani, keeping 10 percent (around $13,765). Shemirani’s participation in the scheme resulted in a tax loss to the IRS of more than $39,000.

As with Moossazadeh, Rabbi Goldstein used coded language to discuss the scheme with Shemirani, and he concealed his return of the “donations” by returning Shemirani’s payments in large amounts of cash. As Shemirani admitted in his plea agreement, Goldstein texted him in June 2015 to alert him that he would have cash available: “The baker will be back in July and will have all the Chalah you need :)” In July 2015, he followed up: “I just got a call from the Baker he may be in this Friday do you still need Chalah?” A year later, Goldstein continued the disguise, alerting Shemirani: “The Baker came today and actually be a nice amount of fresh Chalah – you can come by today and pick it up.”

Shemirani heard from Rabbi Goldstein again on October 20, 2018, when Goldstein appeared unannounced at Shemirani’s door. As Shemirani admitted, Goldstein warned that he was under investigation and that his home and office had been searched by federal agents. He alerted Shemirani that the next time they saw each other, Goldstein might be “wearing a wire.” Shemirani understood this was a warning, and he took steps to amend his fraudulent tax returns in response.

Shemirani was arraigned and entered a guilty plea on July 13, 2020, before U.S. Magistrate Judge Karen S. Crawford. His sentencing is scheduled on October 19, 2020, at 9 a.m. before U.S. District Judge Cynthia Bashant. He has agreed to make full restitution to the IRS including all unpaid taxes, penalties (including a 75 percent fraud penalty), and interest.

5. Defendant Boris Shkoller

Boris Shkoller admitted that from 2015 to 2016, he “donated” $122,000 to Chabad of Poway and secretly received 90 percent—or $109,800—back from Goldstein. Shkoller used Alexander Avergoon as a conduit to make the payments and receive the kickbacks. Avergoon also passed along fraudulent and backdated donation receipt letters that fraudulently verified Shkoller’s “generous tax deductible donation[s].” Shkoller admitted that he filed fraudulent tax returns for both years, resulting in tax losses to the IRS of more than $36,000.

Shkoller was arraigned and pleaded guilty today before U.S. Magistrate Judge Karen S. Crawford. His sentencing is scheduled on October 19, 2020 at 9 a.m. before U.S. District Judge Cynthia Bashant. He has agreed to pay $53,772 in restitution to the IRS for his tax underpayment, penalties, and interest.

U.S. Attorney Brewer commended the excellent work of prosecutors Emily Allen, Andrew Young and Oleksandra Johnson as well as case agents from the FBI and IRS.

TMML2024032494617,Afeez Olajide Adebara,"Alert ID: TMML2024032494617
TULSA, Okla. – A Norman man pleaded guilty Tuesday in U.S. District Court for his role as a money launderer in a Nigerian romance scam that defrauded multiple victims, including elder Americans, of millions, announced U.S. Attorney Trent Shores.

Afeez Olajide Adebara, 35, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit money laundering before U.S. District Court Judge Gregory K. Frizzell. Adebara’s sentencing hearing is set for Feb. 3, 2021.

“Adebara organized and led a money laundering operation from Oklahoma in order to conceal the proceeds of a Nigerian Romance Scam. He and his co-conspirators defrauded an Oklahoman and two other victims of more than $1.5 million,” said U.S. Attorney Trent Shores. “Romance scams inflict the highest reported financial losses yearly, totaling about $200 million in 2019, when compared to other online scams. Con artists like Adebara have no shame. They care not if their victims are elders, veterans, or hard working Americans living paycheck to paycheck. I commend the FBI agents and federal prosecutors who took down this international money laundering operation.”

In his plea agreement, Adebara admitted that he knew the money involved in the financial transactions involved the proceeds from unlawful activity. He further stated that he knew the financial transactions were designed, in whole or in part, to conceal or disguise the nature, the location, the source, the ownership, or the control of the proceeds of the unlawful activity.

From 2017 through and November 2019, Adebara knowingly concealed the proceeds of a romance scam operation by moving money between and among multiple bank accounts that were opened under various aliases using fake passports and other fraudulent identification documents to obscure the source of the funds and the identities of the co-conspirators. Court documents state that he and his co-conspirators took further steps to conceal the source of the funds, took a commission, and directed the remainder of the funds back to the online romance scammers in Nigeria, including in the form of vehicles and vehicle parts.

According to court documents, Adebara coordinated with overseas co-conspirators who had assumed false identities on online dating websites and social media platforms with the intent to defraud victims. Adebara opened multiple accounts using fraudulent identities then provided the account and routing numbers to the overseas co-conspirators. The overseas co-conspirators told victims they were U.S. residents working abroad. In fact, the investigation revealed that these overseas co-conspirators were located in Nigeria. As these online “relationships” continued, the overseas co-conspirators’ would request increasingly larger sums of money, claiming that the funds were needed to complete business projects or to return to the United States. The victims were directed by the overseas co-conspirators to send funds to Adebara and others’ bank accounts, assuring the victims that he would allocate the money as needed.

Adebara was charged on Nov. 13, 2019, along with nine co-defendants. John Oluwaseun Ogundele, 31, formerly of Norman, pleaded guilty on June 15, 2020.

The remaining defendants are Joshua Naandom Ditep, 25, Nigerian citizen and lawful permanent resident of the United States residing in Norman; Paul Usoro, 26, Nigerian citizen and lawful permanent resident of the United States residing in Norman; Chibuzo Godwin Obiefuna, Jr., 27, U.S. citizen residing in Long Beach, California; Tobiloba Kehinde, 28, Nigerian citizen residing in Norman; Jamiu Ibukun Adedeji, 24, Nigerian citizen, residing in Norman; First and last name unknown #1, who maintained an address in Brooklyn, New York; First and last name unknown #2, who maintained an address in Dallas, Texas; and First and last name unknown #3, who maintained an address in Dallas, Texas. Ditep, Usoro, Obiefuna, Kehinde, and Adedeji await trial while the three additional co-defendants remain fugitives. These remaining defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.

The FBI’s Oklahoma City Field Office conducted the investigation. Trial Attorney Babasijibomi Moore of the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section and Assistant U.S. Attorney Christopher Nassar of the Northern District of Oklahoma are prosecuting the case.

This case is part of an ongoing national effort by the Department of Justice to address online fraud schemes often based out of Nigeria that target U.S. citizens. The public is encouraged to report potential online fraud activity or scams to the FBI.",money laundering
TMML2024032703620,Kenneth Lay,"Alert ID: TMML2024032703620
Enron Corp. founder Kenneth Lay, who faced decades in prison for one of the most sprawling business frauds in U.S. history, died Wednesday while vacationing in Aspen, Colo. He was 64.

Lay died of coronary artery disease, according to Mesa County Coroner Robert Kurtzman, who added that there was evidence Lay had a previous heart attack.

The Pitkin, Colo., Sheriff's Department said they were called to Lay's house in Old Snowmass, Colo., shortly after 1 a.m. He was taken to Aspen Valley Hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 3:11 a.m. Lay, who lived in Houston, frequently vacationed in Colorado.

Lay ascended from near-poverty as a minister's son in Missouri to the pinnacle of corporate America. He was considered a visionary who had President Bush's ear during Enron's halcyon days, but his reputation and monumental wealth shattered with that of his company.

""I guess when you're facing the rest of your life in jail and in your heart you know you're an innocent man, I guess it's too much to bear,"" said close friend Willie Alexander.

Lay turned a sleepy natural gas pipeline group into a model of new age capitalism, says CBS News' Harry Smith. Enron became a darling of Wall Street and at its peak turned a $100 billion profit.

Lay and former Enron executive Jeffery Skilling were convicted of conspiracy and securities and wire fraud on May 25. The verdict put the blame for the 2001 demise of the high-profile energy trader, once the nation's seventh-largest company, squarely on its top two executives.

Lay was also convicted of bank fraud and making false statements to banks in a separate, non-jury trial related to Lay's personal finances. All along, Lay insisted there was no fraud at Enron, Smith reports. But a jury wasn't convinced.

Family spokeswoman Kelly L. Kimberly issued a statement saying, ""Ken Lay passed away early this morning in Aspen. The Lays have a very large family with whom they need to communicate. And out of respect for the family, we will release further details at a later time.""

Pastor Steve Wende of First United Methodist Church of Houston, said in a statement that church member Lay died unexpectedly of a ""massive coronary.""

Wende said Lay and his wife, Linda, were in Colorado for the week ""and his death was totally unexpected. Apparently, his heart simply gave out.""

Lay was scheduled to be sentenced Oct. 23. He faced decades in prison.

Skilling, reached by telephone at his home in Houston, told The Associated Press that he was aware of Lay's death, but declined further comment.

Prosecutors in Lay's trial declined comment Wednesday, both on his unexpected death and what may become of the government's effort to seek a $43.5 million judgment from Lay that they say he pocketed as part of the conspiracy.

Lay showed no signs of either physical or mental weakness before or during his trial, reports CBS News correspondent Barry Bagnato. He was combative on the witness stand and was hurt by his main lawyer's sudden illness.

Lay led Enron's meteoric rise from a staid natural gas pipeline company formed by a 1985 merger to an energy and trading conglomerate that reached No. 7 on the Fortune 500 in 2001 and claimed $101 billion in annual revenues. He traveled in the highest business and political circles.

For many years, his corporation was the single biggest contributor to President Bush, who nicknamed him ""Kenny Boy.""","fraud charges, convicted"
TMML2024031363621,Mauricio Macri,"Alert ID: TMML2024031363621
BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - A judicial probe of possible corruption during Argentina’s last government is also threatening the new administration as some of President Mauricio Macri’s own allies face investigation.

Macri, a center-rightist, took over as president in December from outgoing leftist Cristina Fernandez, pledging to root out corruption as well as implement sweeping market-friendly economic reforms.

Investigations have already led to the arrest of a Fernandez ally and landed the ex-president in court for questioning. But now questions are also being asked of some close to Macri, threatening to taint his image.

Iecsa, a construction firm that is part of the Macri family empire and controlled by his cousin Angel Calcaterra, is one of nearly 100 companies in Argentina being investigated as part of Brazil’s growing “Car Wash” scandal, an Argentine judicial source close to the case told Reuters.

The source did not provide specifics of the Iecsa case, but the “Car Wash” probe has focused on kickbacks and other irregularities in bloated contracts at state oil firm Petrobras.

A source close to Iecsa said the company “has never been notified of any investigation”.

Government anti-money laundering and anti-corruption officials, newly appointed by Macri, are pushing to investigate corruption under Fernandez’s administration.

They have encouraged whistleblowers to come forward and offered lighter punishments for wrongdoers in exchange for information.

Macri has kept his distance from the probes.

“I will permit, stand back and work with it when needed, but justice has to work independently,” said Macri this week.

Still, Fernandez is portraying herself as the victim of persecution.

“They can call me to testify 20 times. They can imprison me. But they will not be able to silence me,” she told cheering supporters after testifying about charges against the central bank for selling U.S. dollar futures at below-market rates during her presidency.

Daniel Scioli, the opposition leader and Fernandez ally who lost to Macri in the presidential election, has warned against a witch-hunt.

“We hope politics does not become judicialised and that the justice system does not become politicized,” he told Reuters.

‘K MONEY ROAD’

Argentine media are closely following the twists and turns of the corruption allegations that have become known as the ‘K money road’, an allusion to Fernandez’s deceased husband and ex-president Nestor Kirchner and their ‘Kirchnerista’ movement.

Prosecutors are probing a complex web of cases linked to property entrepreneur Lazaro Baez, a close ally of both Fernandez and Kirchner.

He was arrested last month for questioning after some $5 million was allegedly deposited in a bank account in his son’s name.

Fernandez denies any wrongdoing.

Associates of Macri, including Iecsa, also have Baez connections. Iecsa joined forces in recent years with Baez’s Austral Construcciones in a failed attempt to compete for public works projects.

Iecsa is not part of the judicial probe into Baez and the source close to the company said it was not a partner of Austral, but “just worked with it on two bids, as it has with many other companies”.

The source added that Macri’s cousin Calcaterra is trying to sell Iecsa to avoid possible conflicts of interest.

Also caught in the probe of Baez is a federal intelligence official, Silvia Majdalani, who was appointed by Macri and is now being investigated for money laundering. Other officials in Macri’s government are also being questioned in the dollar futures case.

A spokesman for the government said: “The government isn’t worried because it is allowing justice to act freely.”

The Supreme Court has asked judges to push ahead with corruption and drug trafficking cases and legal sources say judges who may have faced stonewalling from security forces or the civil service under Fernandez’s government can now count on more collaboration.

“There are judges that now feel empowered to investigate the last administration. Before, they couldn’t get access to information,” a federal court source told Reuters.

Yet, there are political risks. When Fernandez went to court to answer questions in the central bank case, huge crowds filled the streets of Buenos Aires in a show of support as she railed against Macri.

“They went looking for the K money road,” she cried. “They found the M money road.”",corruption
TMML2024032858623,Donald Trump,"Alert ID: TMML2024032858623
(CNN) The orbit of former advisers and associates of President Donald Trump who have been indicted or found guilty grew Thursday when Steve Bannon, his former senior adviser and chief strategist, was arrested and indicted.

The crimes they have been accused of are different and stem from a constellation of alleged criminal conspiracies.

Trump's political guru and onetime chief strategist, Bannon was charged Thursday with defrauding donors of hundreds of thousands of dollars in a border wall fundraising campaign. Once among Trump's most trusted advisers -- with walk-in privileges to the Oval Office -- Bannon left the White House in 2017 on bad terms and, for a period, was on the outs with Trump.

In an interview with The New York Times in February 2019, Trump said he hadn't spoken with his former campaign manager ""in a year and a half."" He did, however, offer praise for Bannon as a top advocate during the President's impeachment who caught his attention.

Trump has praised him more recently, including in an interview on Fox News this summer: ""Steve Bannon's been much better not being involved. He says the greatest president ever. I mean, he's saying things that I said, 'Let's keep Steve out there, he's doing a good job.' But they're all being -- they're all involved.""

Michael Cohen

Trump's onetime lawyer and fixer, Cohen pleaded guilty in 2018 to tax fraud, lying to Congress and campaign finance violations for facilitating hush money payments to two women who alleged past affairs with the President. Trump has denied having affairs with the women.

Last week Cohen released the foreword of his upcoming book, teasing what he claims is a behind-the-scenes exposé of his acts as Trump's fixer -- from stiffing contractors on a business deal to lying about extra-marital affairs to the President's attempts to ""insinuate himself into the world of President Vladimir Putin.""

Paul Manafort

Trump's onetime campaign chairman, Manafort had been in jail since June 2018 before being released to home confinement amid the coronavirus pandemic. He is serving a 7.5-year sentence after being convicted by a jury of tax and banking crimes in August 2018, then pleaded guilty to conspiracy and obstruction of justice.

As part of a plea deal cut in September 2018, Manafort admitted to money laundering, tax fraud and illegal foreign lobbying connected to his years of lucrative work for Ukrainian politicians, as well as defrauding banks to supplement his income with cash through mortgages. He also agreed to cooperate with the prosecutors from then-special counsel Robert Mueller's office -- before lying during those interview sessions.

Rick Gates

A onetime deputy campaign chairman for Trump, Gates was sentenced to 45 days in jail and three years' probation in 2019 after admitting to helping Manafort conceal $75 million in foreign bank accounts from their years of Ukraine lobbying work. Gates shared searing details about Trump's efforts in 2016 with Mueller.

Roger Stone

Trump's friend and political adviser, Stone was convicted of crimes that included lying to Congress in part, prosecutors said, to protect the President. Trump commuted his sentence this summer days, before Stone was set to report to a federal prison in Georgia.

Stone was convicted last year of seven charges -- including lying to Congress, witness tampering and obstructing a congressional committee proceeding -- as part of Mueller's Russia investigation. Among the things he misled Congress about were his communications with Trump campaign officials -- communications that prosecutors said Stone hid out of his desire to protect Trump.

Michael Flynn

Trump's onetime national security adviser, Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his talks with the then-Russian ambassador about approaches that would undermine Obama administration policy before Trump took office.

The case has become a political lightning rod, with Trump and Flynn both saying he's been treated unfairly by the judge and the prosecutors who cut his plea deal. Trump has not ruled out a pardon for Flynn.

A onetime campaign aide, Papadopoulos served 12 days in prison for lying to investigators about his contact with individuals tied to Russia during the 2016 campaign.

George Nader

An informal campaign foreign policy adviser, Nader was sentenced to 10 years in prison by a federal judge in Virginia stemming from his convictions on child sex charges.

Chris Collins

The first member of Congress to endorse Trump, Collins was sentenced to 26 months in prison after pleading guilty to federal charges in an insider trading case.",arrest or found guilty

(CNN) Disgraced former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak has been found guilty on seven charges related to the 1MDB scandal, which saw billions of dollars of taxpayers money funneled and embezzled out of Malaysia.

Tuesday's ruling is the first judgment against Najib, who faces a variety of charges related to the onetime sovereign wealth fund, which prosecutors allege he and his allies used as a personal piggybank to support luxurious lifestyles and fund electioneering.

High Court judge Nazlan Mohammed Ghazali found Najib guilty on all counts brought against him -- abuse of power, money laundering and criminal breach of trust -- in the current trial, which relates to $10 million of funds which were deposited into his personal accounts from a former unit of 1MDB.

Najib has consistently argued his innocence, welcoming the trial -- which he fought against tooth-and-nail before being deposed as prime minister -- as a chance to clear his name.

Ahead of Tuesday's verdict, he wrote on Facebook that ""no matter what the decision is tomorrow in the High Court, it doesn't end here,"" indicating that he would appeal. ""I don't give up,"" he added.

The ruling is the second major development in the 1MDB case this month. Last week, Goldman Sachs, which underwrote much of the 1MDB fund and was facing a host of criminal and regulatory proceedings in Malaysia, agreed to a $3.9 billion settlement with the country's government.

Najib faces prison terms of up to 15 or 20 years for each charge, as well as hefty fines.Sentencing will be announced at a later date. Najib's lawyers have said they will appeal.

Other trials against Najib relating to the 1MDB scandal are still ongoing.

Billions embezzled

The 1Malaysia Development Berhad fund was created soon after Najib took office in 2009, pumping billions in public money into it, with the stated purpose of leading ""market-driven initiatives to assist the government in propelling Malaysia towards becoming a developed nation that is highly competitive, sustainable and inclusive.""

Instead, according to United States prosecutors, 1MDB was used as a slush fund by Najib, his financier Jho Low and other high-ranking officials at the fund, who allegedly embezzled more than $3.5 billion over six years. Swiss prosecutors would later put that figure at over $4 billion.

""(These funds) were intended to grow the Malaysian economy and support the Malaysian people. Instead, they were stolen, laundered through American financial institutions and used to enrich a few officials and their associates,"" said US Attorney General Loretta Lynch in 2016, after the US Department of Justice launched a case against 1MDB in a bid to recover more than $1 billion connected to the conspiracy that was allegedly laundered through the US.

The case attracted international attention thanks to the scale of the graft and the audacity of what Low used some of the allegedly pilfered funds for. According to US prosecutors, Low laundered money from 1MDB through Red Granite, which used it to fund Hollywood movies including ""The Wolf of Wall Street,"" ""Dumb and Dumber To,"" and ""Daddy's Home.""

Low has consistently professed his innocence, but last year he struck a $700 million deal with the US government to end a legal case against him.

He is still wanted for crimes in Malaysia, however, and has been an international fugitive for years now, believed by some to be hiding out in China.

International scandal

In early 2015, Clare Rewcastle-Brown, a British journalist and founder of the Sarawak Report website which reports on corruption in Southeast Asia, received about 227,000 leaked documents relating to 1MDB.

After months of investigation, Rewcastle-Brown published a story alleging more than $700 million had been transferred from the fund to the personal bank accounts of Prime Minister Najib. The Wall Street Journal also published several groundbreaking reports on the scandal, based partly on the same leaked documents.

Following the reports, Malaysian officials raided 1MDB's offices in Kuala Lumpur and investigations were also launched in Hong Kong, Australia, Singapore, Switzerland and the US. Najib told reporters the wrongdoers would be brought to justice.

However, Najib's government consistently blocked probes that appeared to threaten him, including removing the Attorney General who was investigating him and replacing the prosecutor with an ally who later cleared Najib.

Those efforts came to naught, however, when Najib was turfed out of office in a shock election result in 2018, with an opposition coalition winning power in a landslide, clearing the way for the former leader's prosecution.

Within days of the stunning election loss, Najib and his wife were barred from leaving the country. Police soon raided their properties and seized millions of dollars in luxury goods allegedly linked to the 1MDB funds.

In July 2018 -- three years after the first 1MDB stories began emerging -- Najib was charged with four counts of corruption. The charge sheet was later expanded to cover dozens of other alleged crimes.

His wife, Rosmah Mansour, whose profligate spending with funds allegedly embezzled from 1MDB had helped fuel public outrage, was arrested months later.

End of Najib?

Over five years after the first 1MDB stories emerged, Malaysia's government has indicated a desire to finally put the scandal behind it. As well as settling the case with Goldman Sachs, prosecutors also dropped charges against Najib's stepson and ""Wolf of Wall Street"" producer Riza Aziz.

Despite the myriad charges against him, Najib has remained a force in Malaysian politics through the party he once led, United Malays National Organisation (UMNO). Earlier this year, the coalition that toppled Najib fell apart and was itself removed from office, and the current prime minister, Muhyiddin Yassin, relies on UMNO for power.

This had led to some speculation that the government might drop cases against Najib, and observers had long warned that if the cases dragged on too long, the onetime ""Teflon prime minister"" might return to power and effectively pardon himself.

A conviction might benefit Muhyiddin as much as Najib's other political rivals, however.

Writing this week, Bridget Welsh, an expert on Malaysian politics at the University of Nottingham, said that ""Najib -- not opposition leaders Mahathir or Anwar Ibrahim -- is currently Muhyiddin's most serious political competitor for national leadership.""

""If Najib is convicted, he will begin an appeal process that will likely put him out of contention for the next general elections and weaken his hold on UMNO, having to rely on proxies for power,"" she added.

Soon after the verdict was announced, Welsh wrote on Twitter that it ""closes door on Najib's comeback.""",

MEXICO CITY —

Former Mexican Defense Secretary Gen. Salvador Cienfuegos, who led the country’s armed forces for six years under then-President Enrique Peña Nieto, has been arrested on drug trafficking and money laundering charges at Los Angeles International Airport, U.S. and Mexican sources confirmed Thursday.

Two people with knowledge of the arrest said Cienfuegos was taken into custody on a U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration warrant. One of the people said the warrant was for drug trafficking and money laundering charges. Both spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the case publicly.

The DEA declined to comment Thursday night.

Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard did not say on what charges Cienfuegos was detained. He wrote on his Twitter account that U.S. Ambassador Christopher Landau had informed him of the general’s arrest and that Cienfuegos had a right to receive consular assistance.

A senior Mexican official who cannot be quoted because he wasn’t authorized to give details of the case said officials are waiting to be told the specific charges.

The official said Cienfuegos was arrested when he arrived at the Los Angeles airport with his family. His family members were released, and he was taken to the Metropolitan Detention Center.

Cienfuegos served from 2012 to 2018 as secretary of defense. He is the highest-ranking former Cabinet official arrested since the top Mexican security official Genaro Garcia Luna was taken into custody in Texas in 2019. Garcia Luna, who served under then-President Felipe Calderón, has pleaded not guilty to drug trafficking charges.

Cienfuegos is 72 and has retired from active duty. Mexico’s Defense Secretariat had no immediate reaction to the arrest.

Mike Vigil, the DEA’s former chief of international operations, said that when he was in Mexico in 2012 he heard corruption allegations about Cienfuegos.

“There were always allegations of corruption, nothing we could sink our teeth into. That was kind of unheard of because Mexico has always put the military on a pedestal,” said Vigil, author of the book “The Land of Enchantment Cartel.”

“The corruption is just coming to roost, because individuals who were once untouchable are now getting arrested,” Vigil said. “If they cooperate [with U.S. prosecutors], there are others who are going to be falling.” He said U.S. officials “usually don’t want to trade down, they usually trade up,” seeking evidence against equal or higher-ranking officials.

“It’s really a precarious situation for Mexico to have two Cabinet-level officials arrested in the U.S.,” he said.

Whatever the charges, it will be a tough blow for Mexico, where the army and navy are some of the few remaining respected public institutions.

Though President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has vowed to go after corruption and lawbreaking under past administrations, he has also relied more heavily on the army — and charged it with more tasks, ranging from building infrastructure projects to distributing medical supplies — than any Mexican leader in recent history.

Under Cienfuegos, the Mexican army was accused of frequent human rights abuses, but that was true of both his predecessors and his successor in the post.

The worst scandal in Cienfuegos’ tenure involved the 2014 army killings of suspects in a grain warehouse.

The June 2014 massacre involved soldiers who killed 22 suspects at the warehouse in the town of Tlatlaya. Though some died in an initial shootout with the army patrol — in which one soldier was wounded — a human rights investigation later found that at least eight and perhaps as many as a dozen suspects were executed after they surrendered.",arrested for trafficking/money laundering
TMML2024037360629,Brian Mulroney,"Alert ID: TMML2024037360629
OTTAWA – A two-year inquiry into Brian Mulroney’s dealings with German-Canadian arms lobbyist Karlheinz Schreiber has concluded that the former prime minister acted in an “inappropriate” way when he accepted large amounts of cash from Schreiber.

The report by Justice Jeffrey Oliphant said Mulroney “failed to live up to the standard of conduct that he himself adopted in the 1985 ethics code.”

The judge said he could not accept Mulroney’s testimony that his acceptance of at least $225,000 in cash was an error in judgment. Rather, it was an attempt to hide the transactions, Oliphant said.

“The reason Mr. Schreiber made the payments in cash and Mr. Mulroney accepted them in cash was that both wanted to conceal the fact that the transactions had occurred between them,” the judge said in a summary read to the media.

“Something was amiss,” Oliphant said. “These dealings do not reflect the highest standards of conduct, nor do they represent conduct that is so scrupulous it will bear the closest public scrutiny.”

If the dealings were appropriate, there would have been a contract, an exchange of letters or some documentation confirming the agreement, the judge said.

“Why, then, was there a need for such secrecy? The answer is that Mr. Mulroney wanted to conceal the fact that he had received money from Mr. Schreiber.”

However, Oliphant rejected Schreiber's testimony that the lobbying agreement between the two men was made while Mulroney was still prime minister in 1993.

He said he was unable to determine whether Mulroney's statement that he received $225,000 from Schreiber was true or whether, as Schreiber testified, the amount was $300,000.

During the hearings, Mulroney said he took the money to lobby international leaders for the sale of light-armoured vehicles on behalf of Schreiber. But Oliphant expressed skepticism about Mulroney's explanation, saying “for different reasons, none of the people to whom Mr. Mulroney says he spoke were available” to Oliphant commission of inquiry.

“I am not able to find that any services were ever provided by Mr. Mulroney for the monies paid to him by Mr. Schreiber.”

Oliphant noted that Mulroney accepted “cash-stuffed envelopes from Mr. Schreiber on three separate occasions,” did not make a record of the payments, did not deposit the money in a bank or disclose the payments when given an opportunity to do so later. The judge said that this “goes a long way” to “supporting my position that the financial dealings between Mr. Schreiber and Mr. Mulroney were inappropriate.”

Oliphant also criticized Mulroney's statements in 1996 during proceedings in his $50-million lawsuit against the federal government, in which he claimed damages arising from Ottawa's inquiry about Mulroney's financial holdings to the Swiss government. Speaking under oath in that case, Mulroney did not explain his dealings with Schreiber because, the former prime minister later explained, he was not asked specifically about those dealings. Instead, Mulroney said that he had seen Schreiber a couple of times for a “cup of coffee.”

Saying that the former prime minister did not “disclose the true state of affairs,” Oliphant said, “I find that Mr. Mulroney acted inappropriately in failing to disclose his dealings with Mr. Schreiber and the payments he received when he gave evidences” in the Airbus lawsuit.

Mulroney received a $2.1-million settlement from the federal government in that lawsuit, but former Liberal cabinet ministers have said they would not have made the settlement had they known at the time of Mulroney's financial link to Schreiber.

In Question Period Monday, Liberal MP Siobhan Coady (St. John's South - Mount Pearl) asked whether Ottawa would press for the return of the $2.1 million, given Oliphant's findings. Justice Minister Rob Nicholson said only that the government would review the inquiry's recommendations.

The inquiry arose from a 2007 allegation by Schreiber that he paid a large sum of money to Mulroney as part of a lobbying deal the two men reached shortly before the Progressive Conservative politician left 24 Sussex in 1993.

Schreiber said it was $300,000 but Mulroney later said he took $225,000 in cash. Mulroney also disputed the timing, saying the two men met shortly before he stepped down as prime minister but no agreement was reached until later.

Schreiber’s allegations sparked national attention, prompting Mulroney to call for hearings to clear the air. Harper agreed and announced on November 14, 2007, that University of Waterloo President David Johnston would develop a mandate for a public inquiry.

Based on Johnston’s recommendations, Harper established the Oliphant commission, which held public hearings in 2009. Oliphant’s report was due Dec. 31, but, citing the 150,000 pages of documents received at the inquiry, Oliphant asked for an extension until today.

Oliphant was asked to delve into the circumstances surrounding Schreiber’s payments to Mulroney, including when they were made, what was the source of the cash, what services—if any—were rendered in return for the money and what happened to the cash after Mulroney received it. The judge was also ordered to examine whether ethical rules or guidelines for MPs or former cabinet ministers were broken by Mulroney.

Estimates of the cost of the inquiry have reached $16 million—including $1.8 million for Mulroney’s lawyers.

Mulroney and Schreiber both testified at the Oliphant inquiry last year; Schreiber was extradited to Germany shortly after the hearings wrapped up. German authorities had been seeking his extradition for 10 years on charges of fraud and bribery in relation to a 1999 corporate bribery scandal that shook the country’s political foundations.

Earlier this month, Schreiber was sentenced by a German court to eight years in prison for tax evasion.

Before Oliphant was appointed, Mulroney gave testimony on his dealings with Schreiber at a House of Commons committee. After the parliamentary hearings, Mulroney changed his mind about having a commission of inquiry, saying it was no longer necessary. But Harper went ahead anyway with the Oliphant commission.

A source close to the former prime minister said last week that he just wants to put the entire Schreiber affair behind him as soon as possible.

“The absolute need from Mr. Mulroney’s and his family’s point of view at this stage is that this closes the door, that it is the end of the story and life continues in a different frame the day after,” the source said.",corruption

Companies controlled by Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich donated tens of millions of pounds to a highly controversial Israeli settler group accused of displacing Palestinian families from Jerusalem, according to leaked documents seen by BBC News Arabic.

The billionaire Russian oligarch, who was granted Israeli citizenship in 2018, has been an avid philanthropist in Israel, donating huge sums to research and development projects and invest ing in local firms.

However, four companies he either owns or controls in the British Virgin Islands have contributed more than $100m (£74m) to Elad, a group that supports settlements in the Palestinian neighbourhood of occupied East Jerusalem called Silwan, BBC News Arabic reported.

Those figures would mean the British football club owner was the biggest single donor over the past 15 years to Elad, a Hebrew word which means “God’s eternal faith”, it added.

The group, which also receives backing from the Israeli government, has sought to strengthen the Jewish presence in the neighbourhood of Silwan at the expense of its Arab residents.

Elad runs an archaeological site in Silwan called the City of David that has become a huge tourist attraction. The dig has been criticised by European Union diplomats as seeking to ignore the ancient city’s diverse history in favour of “an exclusively Jewish narrative, while detaching the place from its Palestinian surroundings”.

The City of David website said it is “committed to continuing King David’s legacy as well as revealing and connecting people to ancient Jerusalem’s glorious past through four key initiatives: archaeological excavation, tourism development, educational programming and residential revitalization”.

Elad, similar to other settler organisations, has expanded by buying Palestinian houses and using controversial Israeli laws that allow the state to take over Palestinian property. Approximately 450 settlers now live alongside almost 10,000 Palestinians in Silwan.

BBC News Arabic discovered the Abramovich donations while trawling through thousands of leaked documents detailing $2t n (£1.55tn) of potentially corrupt transactions that were washed through the US financial system.

More than 2,000 suspicious activity reports (SARs) filed with the US government’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) were leaked to Buzzfeed News, which shared them with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, of which the BBC is a member.

Banks and other financial institutions file SARs when they believe a client is using their services for potential criminal activity. While a SAR in itself does not oblige a bank to cease doing business with the client in question, they point to contentious actions hidden in the financial world.

The leaks, dubbed the FinCEN Files, have already rocked the financial sector, with allegations of dirty money flowing freely around the world. Shares in the banking sector fell on Monday. Other high-profile figures, such as Trump’s former political strategist, Paul Manafort, has also been identified in a SAR.

The BBC report did not say whether the Abramovich companies or the donations were included in an SAR, or accuse Abramovich or the firms of breaking the law in any country. Abramovich had been the subject of a 2016 SAR regarding offshore shell companies related to his football business.

In its report, aired on its flagship Panorama programme, BBC Arabic cited Elad as saying they abide by all Israeli non-profit organisation regulations but that they would not confirm if Abramovich was a donor.

The news channel quoted a spokesman for Abramovich as saying: “[he] is a committed and generous supporter of Israeli and Jewish civil society, and over the past 20 years he has donated over five hundred million dollars to support healthcare, science, education and Jewish communities in Israel and around the world.”

Settlement activity on occupied land is considered illegal under international law. Israel argues all of Jerusalem as its sovereign territory, although that claim is largely unrecognised.

Donald Trump’s recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital has emboldened the Israeli government and powerful settler movement. The US ambassador to Israel and vocal supporter of settlements, David Friedman, took part in an opening ceremony at the City of David.",money laundering
TMML2024036734638,Azem SYLA,"Alert ID: TMML2024036734638
Daja (Uncle), is accused of being the leader of a well-structured criminal group which falsified documents, appropriated lands, bribed officials, and laundered money, according to an indictment submitted by the European Union Rule of Law Mission in Kosovo, EULEX, prosecutor and obtained by Prishtina Insight.

The 264-page indictment, drafted by Italian Prosecutor Danilo Ceccarelli, which will be published by Prishtina Insight and BIRN Kosovo’s Albanian-language portal Kallxo in several installments, reveals how Syla’s pension from Switzerland was allegedly used to finance the criminal group and sponsor group meetings in a Prishtina restaurant. The indictment also reveals the involvement of Kosovo Serbs in the group led by the former commander of Kosovo Liberation Army’s, KLA, Headquarters.From a corner of a restaurant in Prishtina’s Sunny Hill neighborhood, Azem Syla’s “HQ” gave out orders, instructions, and guidelines for the other members of the group between 2006-2016, according to the indictment. The prosecution alleges that Azem Syla would sit at a table in the restaurant while his interlocutors would come and go, receiving various orders.The indictment, filed on October 24, accuses tens of individuals of misuse and appropriation of land in Prishtina’s suburbs.Azem Syla, who was a member of the Kosovo Assembly during the 2010-2014 legislature, is on the top of the list of the accused. In the indictment obtained by Prishtina Insight, another 21 are accused of being members a group described by the indictment as one of the most active, well organized and long-lasting in Kosovo’s history.

In April 2016, criminal investigations resulted in a massive police raid by EULEX and Kosovo Police. On the morning of April 27, police raided Syla’s personal compound but failed to apprehend him. A couple of days later, Syla surrendered to police. The prosecution filed two indictments, accusing two groups consisting of 22 and 17 people respectively, on various charges including organized crime, falsifying documents, bribery, fraud and money laundering.

The first count of organized crime accuses Syla and 12 others of having knowingly and intentionally committed serious crimes as part of a structured organized group, with the aim of obtaining financial and material benefits.In the indictment, Syla is described as the “organizer, supervisor, manager and director” of the criminal group. The indictment also accuses him of: “coordinating” and “supervising” the entire operation; assigning other members their roles within a well-structured hierarchy; and approving or refusing operational proposals by the other members. Syla is accused of giving orders and instructions to the other members and asking for reports about the continuous criminal activities. He is also accused of participating in the “underlying criminal offenses” described by the indictment by giving instructions, guidance and approval, and receiving most of the profits from criminal activities.

Shaban Syla, who, like Azem Syla, was born in Kishnareke, played an almost identical role to the former MP. Syla, who in 2012 was found guilty for attempted murder of a member of the Kosovo Democratic League, LDK, as part of ‘the Bllaca 2’ case, is also described as an organizer, supervisor, manager and director of the criminal group. According to the indictment, Shaban and Azem Syla were constantly in touch with regards to strategic decision-making and planning.

“Specifically, he [Shaban Syla] organized and managed all the actions aimed at identifying Serbian individuals who had verdicts and documents useful for the criminal activities, liaised with them and involved them in the organized criminal group; organized and coordinated the falsification of verdicts and of the related documents; identified the socially owned land parcels to acquire illegally; liaised with, and corrupted, officials in the Municipal Court, at the Cadastral Office and in other public offices in order to obtain the original documents to falsify, to receive favorable decision and to speed up the procedure,” the 2016 indictment says.

A similar role was played by Shpresim Uka, another defendant from the ‘Bllaca 2’ case, who was sentenced to 15 years in prison for aggravated murder and attempted aggravated murder.

Ljubisa Vujovic, the only Serb indicted, was a member and supporter of the criminal group and actively participated in criminal activities.

“Specifically, Ljubisa Vujovic provided the group with the original verdict no. 1164/90 dated 24 June 1992, which returned to his family the land parcel no.145 in Fushe Kosova, knowing that the group was going to falsify it replacing that parcel with others,” reads the indictment. Vujovic also supported the group by providing it with “false documents, photos, and personal data of his family members that were used to create false ID documents, authorization, power of attorney and Court certifications.”

Other Serbs involved in the criminal activities have not been indicted because they are unreachable to the prosecution, which suspects they are being sheltered in Serbia. Since Kosovo’s institutions are not recognized by Serbia, suspects have evaded justice in the past by fleeing to Serbia or northern Kosovo.

Thirty-nine people, including their alleged leader Azem Syla, were indicted on charges of organized crime, money laundering, bribery, aggravated fraud, fraud on duty, issuing illegal court decisions, abuse of duty, legalizing falsified content, and fiscal evasion.",

Washington — Federal prosecutors have charged Houston-based technology executive Robert Brockman with hiding $2bn in income from the IRS over 20 years, in the biggest tax fraud case against an individual in US history.

At the same time, the US attorney for the northern district of California announced he had struck a non-prosecution agreement with Robert Smith, the billionaire chief executive of Vista Equity Partners, in exchange for his help in securing the charges against Brockman. Smith was to pay a nearly $140m fine for concealing income offshore as part of the agreement, reports said.

At a press conference, US attorney David Anderson said Brockman used various offshore entities in Caribbean, Bermuda and Switzerland to evade taxes.

He said Brockman also bought and sold debt securities in his own company, ""breaking a promise to investors that he would not buy or sell his own company's debt"".

Anderson said Smith, who famously announced at 2019's Morehouse College commencement that he would pay off the college debt of 2019 graduates, accepted responsibility for his own crimes in the scheme.

A Toronto printer and acclaimed classical pianist accused of a multimillion-dollar fraud stretching back six years was arrested Tuesday, with a court appearance set for next month.

Tzvi Erez, 44, faces 10 charges of fraud, one for each alleged victim, encompassing losses of around $9-million.

The alleged fraud surfaced when Mr. Erez filed for bankruptcy two years ago, police say, and involved him telling the complainants he had secured large printing contracts with such big-league companies as Tommy Hilfiger, Colgate-Palmolive, Loblaw and Subway.

""Basically he asked people to invest in his printing business and promised them returns, but it turns out these contracts were fraudulent,"" said Detective Rudy Martin of the Toronto Police Service's Financial Crimes Unit.

The contracts ostensibly entailed producing catalogues, brochures and other promotional material.

Mr. Erez emigrated from Israel to Canada in 1982 and all his alleged victims belong to Toronto's Jewish community.

""They were business people and elderly people, all kinds, with money I guess, from all over the city,"" Det. Martin said.

Mr. Erez's name is well known in the city's Jewish circles because he is an accomplished pianist, beginning his career in Israel as a childhood prodigy.

Married with two children, he holds a business degree and has released two well-regarded CDs, one of which described him as ""a charismatic genius"" blessed with ""towering musical talent.""

The alleged frauds began in 2005 and continued until 2009, and this is not Mr. Erez's first brush with the law.

In 2009, he was accused of bilking dozens of investors out of $27-million in an alleged Ponzi scheme that went back to 2003.

Those charges, too, arose from the bankruptcy of his printing company, E. Graphix Ltd., and also involved supposedly major printing contracts yielding generous returns.

A receiver's report, however, concluded the operation was far smaller than claimed, its true size concealed with forged invoices and purchase orders, kept afloat with a Ponzi scheme whereby the first investors were repaid with funds put up by new ones.

In a move that generated wide controversy, prosecutors announced in September, 2010 that all the charges had been dropped because of insufficient resources to proceed with the complex case.

A lawsuit was also launched against Mr. Erez by one of the investors, but that too was abandoned as it became clear he had no money.",fraud details

Israel Police recommended indicting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for bribery and breach of trust in two cases Tuesday night, Israel's Channel 2 and Channel 10 reported. After a 14-month-long investigation, police announced on Tuesday that it found enough evidence to recommend the state’s prosecution to indict Netanyahu for bribery and breach of trust in Case 1000, the “gifts affair"" and Case 2000, the "" Yediot Aharanot Affair.""In Case 1000, the “gifts affair,” it is alleged that Netanyahu improperly accepted expensive gifts from different businessmen.In Case 2000, the “ Yediot Aharonot affair,” Netanyahu allegedly negotiated with publisher Arnon “Noni” Mozes for favorable coverage of himself in Yediot Aharonot in exchange for support of a bill to weaken Israel Hayom, the largest circulation Hebrew-language paper and Yediot ’s biggest competitor. Police also reccomended indicting Mozes and Hollywood film producer Arnon Milchan, who is among those alleged to have given Netanyahu expensive gifts as bribes. The prime minister, in the past, rejected both allegations claiming that ""it is not illegal to accept gifts from friends"" and that ""Nothing will happen because nothing happened.""At this stage, the prosecution and Attorney-General Avichai Mandelblit will examine the evidence that police collected throughout the investigations, and will later decide whether to actually indict the prime minister or not.Netanyahu is not required at this point to resign from office. The law says that only after a peremptory Supreme Court verdict (meaning after an appeal was submitted and rejected), the prime minister must resign from office.These police recommendations come in the shadow of an ongoing campaign by Netanyahu to discharge the credibility of his investigators. The premier’s attacks were made in response to remarks made by Police Commissioner Insp.-Gen. Roni Alsheich, who hinted that Netanyahu had sent private investigators to collect information against police officers who are involved in his case.On Thursday, Netanyahu said on Facebook: “It’s shocking to see that he [Alsheich] is repeating the outlandish and false claim that [I] supposedly used private investigators against police officers.”“Every decent person will ask himself: How can people who say such outlandish things regarding the prime minister then question him objectively and be impartial when it is time to reach a decision about him?” Netanyahu asked.",

The Nigerian Supreme Court has rejected an appeal by Bukola Saraki, the president of the Nigerian senate, against his trial for alleged corruption offenses.

Saraki is facing 13 counts of false declaration of assets and is due to be tried by the Court of Conduct Tribunal (CCT). He denies all the charges and went to the Court of Appeal to challenge the jurisdiction of the CCT, the BBC reports. When the Court of Appeal dismissed his challenge on October 30, 2015, Nigeria's Premium Times reports, Saraki appealed to the Supreme Court on November 4, 2015.

On Friday, the Supreme Court upheld the Court of Appeal's ruling.

Saraki is the third-highest ranking political officer in the country and could be banned from holding any political officer for 10 years if he is found guilty. He will now face trial at the CCT, though a date has not yet been set.

The Senate president expressed his disappointment at the ruling but ""believes he will have his day in the court to prove his innocence,"" a statement issued by Saraki's media advisor Yusuph Olaniyonu on Friday said.

Among the allegations against Saraki are that he held a foreign bank account while in public office and that he acquired wealth beyond his legitimate earnings, according to Premium Times. The offenses violate the fifth schedule of Nigeria's constitution and are alleged to have taken place while Saraki was governor of Kwara state in western Nigeria between 2003 and 2011. He was elected president of the Senate in 2015.

""The attached assets includes a talkies (cinema hall) and a hotel in Mumbai, an under construction hotel, a farm house, two bungalows and 3.5 acre land in Panchgani,"" the central investigative agency said in a statement.

The total value of the attachment is Rs 22.42 crore and it includes deposits kept in seven bank accounts, it said.

The total attachment in this money laundering case against the late gangster and his family is about Rs 798 crore as the agency had issuedattachments orders, including for overseas properties worth Rs 203 crore, in the past.

Mirchi, who died in 2013 in London, was alleged to be the right-hand man of global terrorist Dawood Ibrahim in drug trafficking and extortion crimes.

""He (Mirchi) was an international drugs dealer and smuggler who had amassed huge wealth and acquired various immovable properties and businesses across the globe,"" the ED had said earlier.

The agency alleged Mirchi ""indirectly owned various properties in and around Mumbai"".

It has filed a criminal case against Mirchi, his family and others last year to probe money laundering charges linked to their alleged illegal dealings in the purchase and sale of costly real estate assets in Mumbai.

This PMLA case is based on multiple FIRs lodged by the Mumbai police.

The agency had filed a charge sheet in this case before a Mumbai court in December and the court had subsequently issued open-ended non-bailable warrants against Mirchi's sons Asif Memon and Junaid Memon and wife Hajra Memon.

KABUL, Afghanistan — One of Afghanistan's most notorious warlords, designated a ""global terrorist"" by the United States and blacklisted by the United Nations along with Osama bin Laden, wants to come out of the shadows.

Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, now in his late 60s, says he wants a ""real and fair peace"" but with conditions the Kabul government is unlikely to even contemplate, such as the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Afghanistan and new elections in 2016.

The remarks reflect Hekmatyar's attempt to assert influence and gain new leverage in Afghan politics, but what role — if any — the once-feared warlord could play is unclear.

""Peace can be established and the fighting can end once the occupation is over, foreign forces leave and the people of the Afghan nation are given the right to choose their own destiny and establish their own choice of government and governance,"" Hekmatyar said.

The comments were provided to The Associated Press this week after being videotaped in Hekmatyar's hiding place, presumed to be somewhere in Pakistan, where he moved to after being ejected from Iran following the 2001 U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan that removed the Taliban from power. His associates insist, however, that the warlord is in Afghanistan.

Hekmatyar has led an extreme life; his mujahedeen followers have been responsible for the deaths of thousands during the devastating Afghan civil war.

In his student days, he was known for throwing acid in the faces of women who did not cover up. He switched allegiances on the battlefields, fighting first the Soviets, for which he received millions in cash and weaponry from Washington, then the Taliban.

In politics, he espoused radical Islam, served twice as Afghan prime minister and saw Hezb-i-Islami, the party he founded in 1969, fracture and abandon him. The party's military wing offered bin Laden shelter after the al Qaeda leader fled Sudan in 1996, according to the State Department.

But history has relegated Hekmatyar to the sidelines and political analyst Haroun Mir describes him today as a ""spent force, frozen in time.""

The size of any following Hekmatyar could muster is difficult to gauge. The last known attack carried out by his militant group, Hezb-i-Islami Gulbuddin, was in 2013, when at least 15 people, including six American soldiers, were killed in central Kabul.

Afghan security analyst Ali Mohammad Ali says Hekmatyar can no longer run a private army because ""most of his people have joined the Taliban"" or other militant groups, including the emerging ISIS affiliate which has established a presence in Hekmatyar's former strongholds in eastern provinces bordering Pakistan.","designated ""global terrorist"""
TMML2024039230658,Mark Denning,"Alert ID: TMML2024039230658
One of the world's leading fund managers has been forced to resign after the BBC discovered he had broken investment rules.

Mark Denning helped to manage more than $300bn (£229bn; €265n) of investors' money at Capital Group.

BBC One's Panorama uncovered evidence that suggests he was secretly acquiring shares for his own benefit in some of the same companies as his funds.

Mr Denning, who had worked at the firm for 36 years, denies any wrongdoing.

The 62-year-old fund manager left his job five days after Panorama wrote to Capital Group about the findings of its investigation.

Capital Group - which manages almost $2 trillion of assets - said Mr Denning was no longer with the firm.

""We have a Code of Ethics and personal investing disclosure requirements that hold our associates to the highest standards of conduct. When we learned of this matter, we took immediate action,"" it said.

Fund managers are not supposed to invest in the same companies as their funds, because they could potentially profit at the expense of investors.

This is because their size means the funds can drive up a company's share price when they invest. The fund manager could use this power to push up the share price in the companies where they have personal investments, rather than picking the companies that offer the best returns for investors.

Leaked documents

The Panorama investigation discovered that shares were bought on Mr Denning's instructions through a secretive fund based in Liechtenstein.

It was called Morebath Fund Global Opportunities.

Leaked documents show the Morebath fund had invested in a medical research company called Mesoblast, an Indian film company called Eros International and a gold mining company called Hummingbird Resources.

Capital Group funds also invested in all three companies, and the investments in Mesoblast and Eros were made by funds that Mr Denning himself helped to manage.

In the case of Hummingbird Resources, Mr Denning appeared to have another potential conflict of interest as the company was set up and run by his son-in-law.

Conflict of interest

An expert on the financial rules told Panorama that the private purchases by Mr Denning could represent a serious conflict of interest.

Michael Ruck, investigations partner at the law firm TLT, said: ""The whole point behind the regime, in relation to declaring conflicts of interest, is to protect investors.

""If there was an intention by the fund manager to financially benefit themselves, then that does raise serious concerns in relation to their actions.""

The stakes in the three companies were ultimately held through an offshore entity called the Kinrara Trust. It was set up and controlled by Mr Denning.

'Complied with duties'

Mr Denning's lawyers deny that he owns the shares in the three companies because they say he is not a beneficiary of the Kinrara Trust.

""Our client did not declare his interest in the Kinrara Trust to his former employers because he had been irrevocably excluded as a beneficiary. He believed that he had complied with all of his relevant duties.""

Mr Denning's lawyers say he received bad advice. They also say the Morebath fund had an independent asset manager and fund administrator.

However, Panorama has seen evidence that Mr Denning was behind the share purchases in the three companies and documents show the Morebath fund was regularly included in a summary of his personal assets.

Mr Denning appears to have named the Liechtenstein-based fund after the village of Morebath in North Devon. He owns a nine bedroom house, Morebath Manor, and 21 acres of parkland in the village.

The fund manager also owns luxury homes in Chelsea and the Bahamas.

Controversial energy deal

Mr Denning used to work for Capital Group in London and was approved by the City watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority until 2018.

However, four of the funds he managed were aimed at American investors and he had been working from the company's office in Los Angeles.

Panorama also discovered that the Kinrara Trust owned Kinrara International - a company that profited from a controversial energy deal in Senegal.

Kinrara International made $22m after the exploration rights to a huge gas field off the Senegalese coast were sold to BP.

Experts have told Panorama that they believe Mr Denning should also have declared this - because Capital Group had investments in BP and another company involved in the deal called Kosmos Energy.",unethical behaviour (no legal proceedings)
TMML2024038258663,Carl Icahn,"Alert ID: TMML2024038258663
One day in August, 2016, the financier Carl Icahn made an urgent phone call to the Environmental Protection Agency. Icahn is one of the richest men on Wall Street, and he has thrived, in no small measure, because of a capacity to intimidate. A Texas-based oil refiner in which he had a major stake was losing money because of an obscure environmental rule that Icahn regarded as unduly onerous. Icahn is a voluble critic of any government regulation that constrains his companies. So he wanted to speak with the person in charge of enforcing the policy: a senior official at the E.P.A. named Janet McCabe.

Icahn works from a suite of offices, atop the General Motors Building, in midtown, that are decorated in the oak-and-leather fashion of a tycoon’s lair in a nineteen-eighties film. During that decade, Icahn made his reputation as one of the original corporate raiders, pioneering the art of the hostile takeover and establishing himself as a human juggernaut—a pugnacious deal machine, all avarice and swagger. By the time he called the E.P.A., he was eighty, and long since unburdened of any personal or dynastic need to make money; according to Forbes, he is worth approximately seventeen billion dollars. Plenty of titans who are not as old and not as rich as Icahn have opted to devote their remaining years to spending their money, or to giving it away. Not Icahn. A tall man with a shambling manner, he recently grew a white beard, which softens his round face, giving him the cuddly appearance of an elderly Muppet. But he has not lost his taste for the kill. A few years ago, he sold his mega-yacht, because cruising on it bored him. He has engaged in philanthropy, building charter schools and a stadium on Randall’s Island that bears his name. But the charity circuit is a snooze. What Icahn loves beyond all else is to rise late each morning, and then to spend the rest of the day and much of the night working the phone, making deals. Years ago, a reporter asked Icahn why he kept making money when he already had more than he could ever spend. “It’s a way of keeping score,” he said. He is one of the wealthiest individuals not just in the world but in the history of the world—a man who takes pride in many things, not the least of which is his ability to get just about anybody on the phone.

“She’s on vacation,” McCabe’s assistant said, flatly.

For how long?

Two weeks.

To Icahn, there was something that simply did not compute about going on vacation and leaving one’s work behind. Surely, he insisted, McCabe could interrupt whatever leisure activity she was engaged in to take a pressing phone call from Carl Icahn?

No, McCabe’s assistant informed him. She couldn’t.

The old conundrum about whether it is better to be loved or feared has never posed much of a dilemma for Icahn. In “ King Icahn, ” a 1993 biography, the author, Mark Stevens, described his subject as a “germophobic, detached, relatively loveless man,” and quoted one contemporary saying, “Carl’s dream in life is to have the only fire truck in town. Then when your house is in flames, he can hold you up for every penny you have.” When the biography was published, Icahn stocked his office with copies to give to visitors. These days, he bristles at the term “corporate raider,” favoring the euphemism “activist investor,” but the reality is that when Icahn targets a company the response from management is generally terror. He has a volatile temper and a vindictive streak. Everyone makes time to take his calls.

Incredulous that Janet McCabe might not do so, Icahn asked, “What if the world’s falling apart?”

The refiner that he was worried about is CVR Energy, which is based in Sugar Land, Texas. In 2012, Icahn acquired a controlling stake in the company, with the intention of making it more profitable and then selling it at a higher price. But under the Renewable Fuel Standard—a law passed, under George W. Bush, to promote the use of ethanol and other biofuels—refiners like CVR are forced either to blend ethanol into their products or to purchase credits, known as Renewable Identification Numbers, from refiners that do. CVR did not make sufficient investments to blend ethanol into all its products, choosing to buy credits instead. When Icahn bought his shares in the refiner, RIN s were cheap—about a nickel each—so it was reasonably affordable for the company to comply with the law. But in 2013 the price of RIN s, which had been stable, began fluctuating, and by 2016 the company was spending two hundred million dollars a year on credits. When Icahn called McCabe, CVR’s stock had dropped seventy per cent from the previous year. This incensed him.

“Look, I’m too old to be politically correct,” he told CNBC, on September 13th. “This woman, Janet McCabe . . . she’s never run a business.” Icahn pointed out that, “at the risk of being immodest,” he had made a great deal of money in his career. “The government shouldn’t run things, because they aren’t trained to run things,” he continued. This is a core element of Icahn’s philosophy. Jimmy Williams, a former in-house lobbyist for Icahn, told me, “Carl is a man who thinks that business should be unfettered and that government should not be involved in the free-market economy. With every fibre in his body, that is what he truly believes.”

When Icahn couldn’t reach McCabe, he wrote a blistering open letter to the E.P.A., in which he demanded that the rules be changed so that other parties, and not refiners, would be responsible for blending ethanol or purchasing credits. “At the risk of being immodest,” he wrote, “most respected experts involved in markets and the way they function would agree there are few in the country that understand investing in markets better than I do.”

One person who was listening to Icahn was the Republican Presidential nominee, Donald Trump. Icahn and Trump have known each other for decades, and Icahn supported his friend’s aspirations for the White House at a time when they still looked quixotic. Trump has long boasted about his association with more successful businesspeople, dropping references to potentates the way kids decorate their school binders with the names of their favorite pop stars. But, in reality, many New York financiers considered him a buffoon. In 2015, Lloyd Blankfein, the C.E.O. of Goldman Sachs, greeted the suggestion that Trump might run for President by remarking that the notion of the former star of “The Apprentice” having his “finger on the button blows my mind.” In this context, an endorsement from Icahn was a precious credential. On the campaign trail, Trump bragged about his “very dear friend Carl Icahn,” the name functioning as a byword for boundless prosperity.

If Icahn was willing to be enlisted in this fashion, he was also prepared to drop Trump’s name when it served his interest. Appearing on Bloomberg TV on August 16, 2016, he vowed that Trump would put an end to “these crazy regulations” on his first day in office. In fact, Icahn continued, he had spoken with Trump about the E.P.A. rule obliging his refiner to purchase renewable-fuel credits. If elected, Trump “will stop that,” Icahn promised. “That’s a hundred per cent.”

Several weeks after Trump’s victory, Icahn tweeted, “I’ve agreed to serve as a special advisor to the president on issues relating to regulatory reform.” In a press release, Trump said, “Carl was with me from the beginning and with his being one of the world’s great businessmen, that was something I truly appreciated. He is not only a brilliant negotiator, but also someone who is innately able to predict the future, especially having to do with finances and economies.” He added that Icahn would help him address regulations that were “strangling” American business.

Icahn’s role was novel. He would be an adviser with a formal title, but he would not receive a salary, and he would not be required to divest himself of any of his holdings, or to make any disclosures about potential conflicts of interest. “Carl Icahn will be advising the President in his individual capacity,” Trump’s transition team asserted.

In the months after the election, the stock price of CVR, Icahn’s refiner, nearly doubled—a surge that is difficult to explain without acknowledging the appointment of the company’s lead shareholder to a White House position. The rally meant a personal benefit for Icahn, at least on paper, of half a billion dollars. There was an expectation in the market—an expectation created, in part, by Icahn’s own remarks—that, with Trump in the White House and Icahn playing consigliere, the rules were about to change, and not just at the E.P.A. Icahn’s empire ranges across many economic sectors, from energy to pharmaceuticals to auto supplies to mining, and all of them are governed by the types of regulations about which he would now potentially be advising Trump.

Janet McCabe, who left the E.P.A. in January, and now works at the Environmental Law and Policy Center, told me, “I’m not naïve. People in business try to influence the government. But the job of the government is to serve the American people, not the specific business interests of the President’s friends. To think that you have somebody with that kind of agenda bending the President’s ear is troubling.”

Conflicts of interest have been a defining trait of the Trump Administration. The President has not only refused to release his tax returns; he has declined to divest from his companies, instead putting them in a trust managed by his children. Questions have emerged about the ongoing business ties of his daughter and son-in-law, Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, who, since early 2016, have reaped as much as two hundred million dollars from the Trump hotel in Washington, D.C., and from other investments. Although Trump promised to “drain the swamp,” he has assembled a Cabinet of ultra-rich Americans, including two billionaires: Betsy DeVos, the Secretary of Education, and Wilbur Ross, the Secretary of Commerce.

But Icahn is worth more than the Trump family and all the members of the Cabinet combined—and, with no constraint on his license to counsel the President on regulations that might help his businesses, he was poised to become much richer. Robert Weissman, who runs the watchdog group Public Citizen, told me, “This kind of self-enrichment and influence over decision-making by an individual mogul who is simultaneously inside and outside the Administration is unprecedented. In terms of corruption, there’s nothing like it. Maybe ever.” In conversations with me, financiers who have worked with Icahn described his appointment as a kind of corporate raid on Washington. One said, “It’s the cheapest takeover Carl’s ever done.”

If you squint, Trump and Icahn look alike. Both grew up in Queens and have an outer-borough chip on their shoulders. Both first came to tabloid prominence against the gaudy backdrop of the nineteen-eighties. Both are brash, plainspoken street fighters, examples of an American archetype: the populist rich guy. But Trump comes from the wealthy enclave of Jamaica Estates, whereas Icahn grew up in a lower-middle-class family in Bayswater. His mother, Bella, was a schoolteacher; his father, Michael, was a failed opera singer who, even though he was an atheist, became the cantor in a local synagogue, because he loved the music. Carl was an only child, born toward the end of the Depression, in 1936. Throughout his youth, his father railed against the robber barons, condemning the concentration of extreme wealth. Icahn told Mark Stevens, “The social juxtaposition of a tiny group of people living in great splendor and many more living in abject poverty was anathema to him.”

As a boy, Icahn was bright and ambitious. When he was offered a scholarship to Woodmere Academy, an expensive private school on the South Shore of Long Island, his parents toured the campus and met with teachers. But they worried about the values that their son would be exposed to there, so they sent him to public high school instead. The sting of that reversal lingered. Half a century later, in the heat of a high-stakes negotiation, Icahn would occasionally digress to inform his adversaries that although he attended public school instead of Woodmere Academy, he still went on to become a billionaire. Icahn is an old man now, with an old man’s penchant for repeating stories; he frequently returns to the theme that his parents underestimated him. “My father was never able to accomplish anything,” he once said, adding, “I never respected him.”

In 1960, after studying philosophy at Princeton (where he wrote a thesis titled “The Problem of Formulating an Adequate Explication of the Empiricist Criterion of Meaning”) and a stint in medical school (he was a hypochondriac, which did not help his bedside manner), Icahn shifted to Wall Street. For a time, he worked as an arbitrageur, but he eventually established himself as a takeover artist, orchestrating high-profile raids on companies such as Texaco, RJR Nabisco, and Phillips Petroleum. His method was straightforward: he identified businesses whose assets were worth more than their stock; he acquired enough of that stock to force changes in the company which drove up the stock price; then he sold the stock. Implicit in Icahn’s approach was the conviction that he was smart enough to know more about how to make money in a given business than the executives who actually ran the business. He regarded the management at the companies he targeted with contempt. Unlike Trump, Icahn was not one to insinuate himself into the sort of club that would not accept him as a member; he preferred to storm the clubhouse with a pitchfork. One of Icahn’s oft-repeated bromides is that the average C.E.O. is like a fraternity president: a nice guy to have a beer with, but maybe not too bright.

Corporations, seeing Icahn coming, often tried to fight him off. His reputation grew so fearsome that some companies paid him to go away by buying his shares back at a premium—a practice known as “paying greenmail.” Marty Lipton, a corporate lawyer whose firm has often been hired by companies that were looking to thwart an Icahn takeover, wrote a memo four years ago in which he described raiders like Icahn as engaging in “a form of extortion.” In Lipton’s view, such investors “create short-term increases in the market price of their stock at the expense of long-term value.” In the nineties, when Icahn was fighting for control of Marvel Comics, the company’s C.E.O., a veteran of the Israeli Army, likened dealing with him to negotiating with terrorists.

Icahn prefers to describe himself in more righteous terms, as a warrior for stockholders who have been disenfranchised by inattentive corporate boards and myopic executives. He sees himself as a champion of “shareholder rights,” an advocate for the little guy. By going after lacklustre management, he argues, he has generated “billions and billions” of dollars for shareholders, while managing to make out just fine himself. “I’m like a gunfighter you hire to save the town,” he once remarked. “That gunfighter is there to do good. He knows he’s on the right side, and he’s proud of it, but he’ll only do what he does if he knows he’ll get paid for it.”

It is true that Icahn has increased the value of many companies that he has invested in, but there are also numerous instances in which, in the aftermath of a raid, he emerges as a winner and everyone else seems to lose. In 1985, he seized control of the airline T.W.A. According to the Times, Icahn celebrated by donning a T.W.A. flight jacket and strutting around his office, exclaiming, “We’ve got ourselves an airline!” He took the company private, pocketing nearly half a billion dollars, then sold off its assets. He also waged a bitter fight against the flight attendants’ union. Because most attendants were women, Icahn insisted, they were not “breadwinners,” and should not expect compensation commensurate with that of male employees. At one point in the negotiations, he reportedly suggested that if the flight attendants were having such trouble making ends meet they “should have married a rich husband.” (Icahn denied having made sexist comments.) C. E. Meyer, the company’s chief executive, described Icahn as “one of the greediest men on earth.” T.W.A. eventually went out of business.

Like Trump, Icahn adheres to a simian dominance code in which every deal—and possibly every human interaction—is a zero-sum contest. Only the alpha prevails. Yet, among Trump’s panoply of wealthy boosters, Icahn is distinctive, if not unique, because of the President’s willingness to play the beta role and genuflect before him. When they met, during the eighties, Trump was an eager supplicant, perhaps in part because Icahn really is what Trump has always pretended to be: a genuine master dealmaker, and a legitimately self-made man. Icahn started out with much less than Trump did, and ended up with vastly more. In 1988, Trump paid eleven million dollars to host a heavyweight title fight between Mike Tyson and Michael Spinks, at Boardwalk Hall, in Atlantic City. Before the fight, Trump took Icahn backstage to meet Tyson. The bout started late, and the announcer was obliged to recite an attenuated roll call of famous guests, among them Trump’s “good friend” Carl Icahn.

Two years later, Trump unveiled the Taj Mahal, a spangled confection on the boardwalk. It had been financed entirely with junk bonds, and by the time construction was complete it was already imperilled by debt. When Trump needed to make an interest payment on the loans, his father, Fred, sent a lawyer to another Trump casino, the Trump Castle, to buy $3.3 million in chips. Not long afterward, Trump was bailed out once again—this time by Icahn. One of Icahn’s specialties is investing in distressed debt, and he purchased the Taj’s outstanding bonds at a steep discount. Rather than oust Trump, Icahn negotiated with the other bondholders to allow Trump to retain equity in the casino, as well as his place on the board. Years later, when Trump named Icahn a special adviser, the Democratic National Committee released a statement that alluded to the Atlantic City episode, suggesting that the White House appointment was “a quid pro quo twenty-five years in the making.” Icahn, however, had already been handsomely remunerated for his investment: he sold the bonds, in 1993, for more than double what he had paid for them.

Icahn and Trump maintained a loose friendship during the ensuing decades, one that was hardly as intimate as Trump likes to make it sound. The very notion of a relationship that transcends mercenary self-interest may be alien to Icahn. Once, in a court proceeding, he said, “If the price is right, we are going to sell. I think that’s true of everything you have, except maybe your kids and possibly your wife.”

“Possibly?” the judge asked.

“Possibly,” Icahn said, adding, “Don’t tell my wife.” (Icahn’s first marriage ended in an acrimonious divorce. He is now married to his former assistant, Gail Golden, who manages his charitable interests.) When Oliver Stone was doing research for his 1987 film, “ Wall Street,” he paid a visit to Icahn, and borrowed one of his observations for the character Gordon Gekko: “If you need a friend, get a dog.” Trump’s almost canine subservience to the older financier is such that, for years, Icahn, who is a tennis fan, has enjoyed droit-du-seigneur access to Trump’s personal box at the U.S. Open.

In 2010, Trump again found himself in trouble in Atlantic City. But this time Icahn was his antagonist. Along with a Texas banker, Icahn was trying to gain control of three Trump casinos. When a lawyer asked, during a deposition, whether Icahn intended to rebrand the casinos, he said that a consultant had deemed the Trump name a “disadvantage.” In an interview, Trump shot back, “Everybody wants the brand, including Carl. It’s the hottest brand in the country.” But in Icahn’s opinion the only real downside to shedding the Trump name was the expense that would be associated with changing all the signage. Trump expressed dismay at Icahn’s slight, telling the Times, in 2011, that he was a “loyalist” who prioritized friendship, whereas “with Carl the friendship stops where the deal begins.” (Icahn responded that he did not consider the two of them to be close, adding, pointedly, that he had not been invited to Ivanka Trump’s wedding.) In court papers, Icahn’s lawyers suggested that Trump’s name was no longer “synonymous with business acumen, high quality, and style.” Icahn told the Wall Street Journal, “I like Donald personally, but frankly I’m a little curious about the big deal about the name.” If the Trump brand carried such cachet, he asked, why did Trump properties keep going bankrupt?

Even after Icahn started supporting Trump’s Presidential run, he often seasoned his praise with a dash of disdain. “I’m not here to say Donald’s a great businessman,” he told the Washington Post. “But I will say he’s a consensus builder.” When Trump first announced his candidacy, in June, 2015, he appeared on “Morning Joe,” and said, “I would like to bring my friend Carl Icahn” into the government, suggesting that Icahn might make a good Treasury Secretary. Icahn replied, in a post on his personal Web site, “I am flattered but do not get up early enough in the morning to accept this opportunity.”

When Icahn initially made a takeover bid for CVR Energy, in February, 2012, the company hired Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz, the formidable New York law firm, to deflect him. But Icahn prevailed, acquiring an eighty-two-per-cent stake in the refiner. CVR had never built enough of its own ethanol-blending facilities to comply with the Renewable Fuel Standard, buying RIN credits instead. This was a bad bet. “Up until 2013, the conventional wisdom was that there would be no volatility in RIN prices,” Tristan Brown, a professor at the State University of New York’s College of Environmental Science and Forestry, who has studied the RIN market, told me. But that year prices started to climb. The RIN market is much less transparent than the stock market, and some players appeared to be hoarding credits, which drove up their price. Icahn worried that CVR’s competitors, knowing that the company was in trouble, were deliberately manipulating the price, subjecting his refiner to a so-called “short squeeze.” (Icahn is no stranger to this tactic, having attempted to put a short squeeze on the investor Bill Ackman by driving up the price of Herbalife, a stock that Ackman was betting against.)

During the 2016 Presidential campaign, Icahn—who owns twenty or so companies and has investments all over the world—raised the issue of renewable-fuel credits at every opportunity, speaking of the “insane” perfidy of the E.P.A. and the plight of his refiner. “This is something that Carl does,” a former Icahn employee told me. “He becomes fixated on something, even something that represents a small part of his portfolio. He gets obsessed.”

Trump’s bid for the Presidency may have seemed like a long shot, and Icahn professed to have misgivings about the “negativity” of his chosen candidate. But he believed that Trump would slash regulation and, specifically, would make the change that Icahn wanted on biofuel credits—shifting the so-called “point of obligation” so that other parties, closer in the supply chain to the gas pump, would be compelled to purchase RIN credits, instead of merchant refiners like CVR.

Even if Trump was elected, there were reasons to believe that Icahn’s objective might be difficult to achieve. The ethanol industry opposed shifting the point of obligation, and was represented by experienced lobbyists. In August, 2016, Bob Dinneen, who runs a leading ethanol trade group, the Renewable Fuels Association, told the Houston Chronicle that the Renewable Fuel Standard functions basically as it should, providing incentives to refiners that blend ethanol and penalizing those which do not. Changing the regulation, Dinneen said, would simply reward “folks who haven’t done what the law said they should do.”

The Renewable Fuel Standard had passed with support from an improbably diverse coalition: environmentalists, who wanted to curb greenhouse-gas emissions; national-security hawks, who wanted to reduce reliance on foreign oil; and farm-state lawmakers, who wanted to boost the corn industry. (Most ethanol is made from corn.) Senator Chuck Grassley, the Iowa Republican, opposed shifting the point of obligation. So did the American Petroleum Institute, one of the most powerful lobbying groups in Washington, because some integrated oil giants, such as BP and Shell, were now producing so much blended fuel that they were generating surplus credits, which they sold to smaller refiners like CVR. Because the petroleum industry and the ethanol industry tend to see in one another an existential threat, there are few policy issues on which they agree. The point of obligation for RIN credits is one of them.

This daunting array of forces only intensified Icahn’s ire, reinforcing his sense of himself as an aggrieved outsider. In his open letter to the E.P.A., he fumed that the RIN market was “rigged,” giving Big Oil a windfall at the expense of smaller refiners such as CVR. Without a policy change, he warned, the regulation would soon bankrupt small and mid-sized refiners, creating a Big Oil “oligopoly” that would cause gas prices to skyrocket.

Whatever sympathy Trump may have felt for Icahn’s predicament, he had an important interest of his own: he needed states like Iowa on his side in order to win the Presidency. At a June, 2016, rally in Cedar Rapids, he pledged his support for the Renewable Fuel Standard, and promised to save the ethanol industry, which was “under siege.”

That September, however, something curious happened. The Trump campaign—which had not distinguished itself for the wonky exactitude of its white papers—issued a fact sheet on economic policy that, amid generic promises of “unbridled economic growth,” contained a surprisingly detailed bullet point about the E.P.A.’s RIN program. “These requirements have turned out to be impossible to meet and are bankrupting many of the small and midsize refineries in this country,” the passage read. “These regulations will give Big Oil an oligopoly.” This did not sound especially like Donald Trump. It did sound a lot like Carl Icahn. When the press asked whether the fact sheet signalled Trump’s intention to adjust the rule—at the risk of inflaming Corn Belt voters—a spokesman responded that an “incorrect” version of the fact sheet had been posted. The bullet point disappeared.

As an investor, Icahn likes to zig where others zag. It is not clear how much confidence he had in Trump’s prospects in 2016, or whether, on Election Night, he was as surprised as the rest of the country. But Icahn attended the impromptu victory party at the Hilton in midtown, where nobody seemed to have arranged for balloons, though a cake had been fashioned into a bust of a scowling Trump. Supporters wearing “Make America Great Again” hats celebrated, in a daze. Icahn left the party after midnight. The global markets were tanking on the news of Trump’s win, so he went home and made a billion dollars’ worth of investments.

Within days of the victory, according to people familiar with the situation, Trump had enlisted Icahn to help him staff major government agencies. Icahn employees began reviewing the references and résumés of potential Cabinet appointees. It has frequently been remarked that Trump has stacked his Administration with plutocrats. Less often acknowledged is the degree to which many of these appointments bear Icahn’s fingerprints. On November 15th, Icahn tweeted, “Spoke to @realDonaldTrump. Steve Mnuchin and Wilbur Ross are being considered for Treasury and Commerce. Both would be great choices.” He added, “Both are good friends of mine but, more importantly, they are two of the smartest people I know.” Two days later, Icahn told the Fox Business Channel that he had just had dinner with Mnuchin, and had “urged Donald to consider him.” He continued, “I’m not going to be the one to announce it, but I do believe he will get the job.” On November 30th, Mnuchin did.

When potential Cabinet secretaries visited Trump Tower to meet with the President-elect, they were sometimes sent for a second interview—with Icahn. On the day that Jay Clayton was announced as Trump’s choice to head the Securities and Exchange Commission, he stopped by Icahn’s office for a meeting. Appearing on CNBC in December, Icahn defended his role as a talent spotter for the Trump Administration. “Over the years, you develop instincts for picking the right C.E.O.,” he said. “Is there anything wrong with me saying, ‘This guy is the right guy for this job at this time’? It doesn’t mean Donald is going to take my advice, necessarily.”

When Scott Pruitt visited Trump Tower to discuss the top job at the E.P.A., the President-elect concluded the interview by instructing him to walk two blocks uptown to meet with Icahn. Trump, according to a Bloomberg News account, told him, “He has some questions for you.” Pruitt was precisely the sort of candidate that Icahn might favor. A fierce opponent of environmental regulation, Pruitt had spent years, as the attorney general of Oklahoma, suing the agency that he was now in talks to oversee. Even so, Pruitt knew that Icahn would likely want to discuss one particular issue— RIN credits—and as Pruitt and an aide headed up Fifth Avenue they searched the Internet for information on the credits system and its impact on Icahn’s refiner.

Pruitt was nominated on December 8th. The next day, Icahn said in an interview with Bloomberg News, “I’ve spoken to Scott Pruitt four or five times. I told Donald that he is somebody who will do away with many of the problems at the E.P.A.” He continued, “I do think he feels pretty strongly about the absurdity of these obligations, and I feel that this should be done immediately.” One reason that the RIN market is so unstable is that the price of the credits is extremely sensitive to developments in the news that might affect their future value. On the day that Pruitt was appointed, the price of RIN s plunged—a welcome outcome for Icahn, because it would cost CVR less to purchase the credits that it needed to fulfill its regulatory obligation.

On December 22nd, the day after Icahn was formally declared to be an adviser to the President, RIN prices dropped again. It was hardly lost on Wall Street that the famously single-minded investor might leverage his new role to advocate for his own investments. Barron’s asked, “Has Carl Icahn been appointed Secretary of Talking His Own Book?” The Web site Dealbreaker, noting Icahn’s lack of conflict-of-interest constraints, proposed an alternative job title: “Secretary of Do Whatever the Fuck You Want.”

All Presidents seek advice from the private sector. Sometimes they have done so informally, as when Bill Clinton made late-night phone calls to a “kitchen cabinet” of business leaders. On other occasions, an Administration has brought executives into the bureaucracy on a part-time basis, making them so-called Special Government Employees, which requires certain divestments and disclosures. Between these informal and formal models lies a third option: Presidents often establish outside advisory boards of corporate leaders; in such situations, the business leaders are not expected to give up any of their holdings, and may advocate on behalf of their industries without having to register as lobbyists. Icahn has likened his sinecure to this type of arrangement, saying, “I’m not making any policy. I am only giving my opinion.”

For any executive, having access to the Oval Office can be good for business. In a new research paper, “ All the President’s Friends,” the University of Illinois finance professors Jeffrey R. Brown and Jiekun Huang studied the share prices at companies whose executives visited the White House, and found that the real, or implied, influence of such encounters boosted the value of the companies in the months after such visits. Jimmy Williams, Icahn’s former lobbyist, told me, “Can Carl Icahn take his influence with the President and make deals that benefit him? Any C.E.O. who has a relationship with the President can do that, regardless of party.”

Brown and Huang were able to write their paper only because the Obama White House made public its visitor logs—something that Trump has refused to do. Without such information, it is impossible to know which executives are meeting with the Trump Administration at the White House. And the kind of outside panels that Icahn considers to be similar to his role are subject to the Federal Advisory Committee Act, which mandates that their meetings must be held in public. Austan Goolsbee, who served as the chairman of Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers, told me, “The Obama Administration established clear disclosure and full transparency about what advice people were giving and when they were giving it. You can be an outside adviser or a government employee. The rules are clear for each. With Icahn, they seem to be trying to invent a kind of Guantánamo Bay situation, in which you’re simultaneously both and neither.”

Norm Eisen, who served as Obama’s Special Counsel for Ethics and Government Reform, argues that Icahn is “not just an outside kibbitzer” but a formal adviser who should be subject to constraints. “He gets a title,” Eisen said. “He gets a broad policy portfolio. He’s involved in personnel decisions, in policy discussions. To me, all of that adds up to him being a Special Government Employee.” The blitheness with which Icahn and the Trump White House sidestepped the federal requirements is evidence, Eisen contends, that “this is a lawless Administration.” Immediately after Icahn’s appointment was announced, shares in Icahn Enterprises surged. Forbes estimated that his stake in the company rose in value from $6.8 billion to $7.3 billion—an increase of five hundred and ten million dollars, in a day.

In early February, Icahn contacted Bob Dinneen, the head of the Renewable Fuels Association. Icahn proposed that they meet to discuss Dinneen’s opposition to shifting the point of obligation for RIN s. Dinneen took the train from Washington to New York and went to the offices of Icahn Enterprises. Icahn, as a younger man, hopped on planes to visit companies he was investing in, but now he mostly has people come to him. His offices are full of reminders, as if arranged by a set decorator, that Icahn is a conqueror: the walls are lined with oil paintings depicting famous battles, as well as framed stock certificates and other trophies from companies that he has subdued. A pair of antique duelling pistols adorn his desk.

Icahn is known for his stamina and deviousness as a negotiator. Connie Bruck, in her 1988 book, “ The Predators’ Ball,” describes his passion for all-night negotiation sessions, and notes that some of his interlocutors suspect that he deliberately prolongs these encounters, not just as a tactic but “because he is having such a good time.” Icahn is a serious chess player; as a young man, he considered becoming a chess master but decided not to, because there was no money in it. He paid his way through Princeton, in part, with poker earnings, and he has played the game with Leon Black, the founder of Apollo Global Management; Sam Waksal, the ImClone founder, who went to prison for insider trading; and the onetime junk-bond king Michael Milken, who has also done time for white-collar crime. “Waksal, Milken, Ivan Boesky,” the former Icahn employee said. “Carl has never got into trouble. But he’s played with everyone who did.” In his business dealings, Icahn is a master of the bluff. “Carl views the legal norms as a starting point for a negotiation, rather than a moral compass,” a financier who has faced off against him told me. “He’s not afraid to cross the line if he thinks he’s on firm ground. ‘Perhaps the law says that this is wrong. But I know better, and I am willing to sue or be sued.’ It’s a rare breed of person who will do that. Carl lives in that breach.”

On February 27th, the news leaked that Dinneen and Icahn had struck a deal: the Renewable Fuels Association would end its long-held opposition to changing the point of obligation, and side with Icahn in his push to shift the obligation away from refiners like CVR. This was a surprising development. There had been no ambiguity about Dinneen’s position, and earlier that month the Renewable Fuels Association had made a submission to the E.P.A. objecting to such a change. What was behind this abrupt reversal?

Some speculated that Dinneen had been influenced by Valero, a refiner whose biofuels subsidiary had recently joined his association, and which had sent a representative to join Dinneen at his meeting with Icahn. Like CVR, Valero had not sufficiently invested in blending infrastructure and was spending huge sums on RIN credits. But, after reporters hounded Dinneen, he offered a different explanation: in a statement, he explained that he had “received a call from an official with the Trump Administration, informing us that a pending executive order would change the point of obligation.” In other words, the policy was going to change by Presidential fiat, whether the industry liked it or not. “I was told in no uncertain terms that the point of obligation was going to be moved,” Dinneen said. The executive order would be “non-negotiable.”

Confronted with this fait accompli, Dinneen apparently felt that his only option was to secure whatever concessions he could for his industry. One long-standing priority for Dinneen and other biofuel advocates has been to change laws so that gas blends containing fifteen per cent ethanol can be sold year-round. (Such blends cannot legally be sold during the summer, the peak driving season; Dinneen contends that the prohibition, meant to alleviate smog, is outdated.) So Dinneen pressed for that adjustment, in exchange for his acquiescence on the point of obligation.

Many ethanol-industry watchers I spoke with were flabbergasted by this turn of events. When I called Dinneen, he told me that the only Trump Administration official he had been speaking with was Icahn. “I’m old-school,” Dinneen said. “If I get a call from a special adviser to the President, I’m going to take it.” Dinneen explained that although Icahn never said explicitly that he was speaking on behalf of the President, he did say that he had discussed the point of obligation with Trump, and that he was confident that a change in policy was coming soon. Normally, Dinneen pointed out, any negotiation between the government and private industry would take place with “an army of people” assembled on opposite sides of a conference table: a phalanx of lawyers, technical specialists, and other advisers. This was different. Then again, he noted, with a dry chuckle, “This whole town is different now.” Now he was cutting deals, mano a mano, with Icahn: a friend of Trump, the owner of a refiner, and a special adviser to the President. If this was the new reality, Dinneen figured, he needed to find a way to work with it. To do otherwise would be malpractice, he said, adding, “Icahn had a title I couldn’t ignore.”

Dinneen insisted to me that he and Icahn never struck a conclusive deal; they simply came to an agreement that he would propose to his board that the association end its opposition to shifting the point of obligation. But, after a phone call with Dinneen on February 23rd, Icahn spoke with the President and relayed the substance of this agreement. Icahn, who had been out walking his dog, talked to Trump from the lobby of his apartment building. Bloomberg News later reported that, according to Icahn, “Trump seemed receptive.” Trump instructed Icahn to telephone Gary Cohn, his senior adviser on economic issues. Cohn handed the matter to an aide on the National Economic Council, a former oil lobbyist named Mike Catanzaro, who spent an hour going through the details with Icahn. When, four days later, Bloomberg News broke the story that an executive order was imminent, corn and gasoline prices went berserk.

It was not hard to believe that the Trump White House had shifted policy at the behest of an industry crony. The Administration had devoted itself, in its early days, to dismantling the regulatory state, in close consultation with business interests. The White House established deregulation teams at various federal agencies. Administration officials have refused to disclose the names of team members, but reporting by ProPublica and the Times suggests that many of them have come from the regulated industries themselves.

Efforts at health-care reform, an infrastructure bill, and tax cuts have all stalled, stymied by the infighting, indiscipline, and incompetence of the Trump Administration. But deregulation has been a quiet success, and nowhere more so than at the E.P.A. Pruitt has not made it a habit to meet with senior career officers at the agency; he does, however, meet regularly, behind closed doors, with industry executives. Some observers fear that the E.P.A. is now run like a Senate office, where representatives meet with constituents and do constituent services—except that the constituent is industry. For example, under the Obama Administration the E.P.A. moved to ban chlorpyrifos, a pesticide manufactured by Dow Chemical, after agency scientists found that it caused neurodevelopmental damage in children. Dow lobbied against the ban, and Pruitt recently tabled it, citing “uncertainty” about the scientific evidence that it is hazardous to kids.

Icahn could scarcely have asked for a more business-friendly figure at the E.P.A. But, when news leaked about a policy shift on the point of obligation, the ethanol industry protested. Jeff Broin, the C.E.O. of Poet, a large ethanol producer, complained, “This was a back-room ‘deal’ made by people who want out of their obligations.” One group, Fuels America, declared that Dinneen’s Renewable Fuels Association was “no longer aligned with America’s biofuel industry,” and severed ties with it. Emily Skor, who runs Growth Energy, another trade group, objected that Dinneen had been negotiating without consulting other stakeholders in the ethanol industry. “This is no deal for anyone but Carl Icahn,” she said. Senator Joni Ernst, of Iowa, also derided the deal, pointing out that it would benefit only a “select few.”

On February 28th, Kelly Love, a spokeswoman for the White House, denied that there was any plan to shift the point of obligation, telling Reuters, “There is no ethanol executive order in the works.” In an interview with Bloomberg, Stefan Passantino, the White House lawyer in charge of ethics and compliance, questioned any characterization of Icahn as a government official, saying, “He is simply a private citizen whose opinion the President respects and whom the President speaks with from time to time.” In subsequent conversations with industry representatives, Pruitt distanced himself from Icahn’s efforts. Two people who spoke with Pruitt in the aftermath of the news reports about the executive order told me that he had assured them, “I was not consulted on this.”

Brooke Coleman, the executive director of the Advanced Biofuels Business Council, pointed out to me that these events unfolded just a month into the Trump Administration. Many staffers had not arrived yet, and there was no real policymaking apparatus. The point-of-obligation rule was a relatively obscure agenda item, a top priority for almost nobody but Icahn. “This was a middle-of-the-night quick strike,” Coleman said. “In the middle of the night, Icahn said, ‘Sign this.’ But it didn’t work. He got caught.” Those were heady times for executive orders, with the President seeming to sign a new one each day. But several people told me that the point-of-obligation change could not have been made simply by executive prerogative. “It’s a regulation,” Janet McCabe said. “So the regulation would have to be changed, and there is a whole process for that.” In 1946, the Administrative Procedure Act established a protocol for rule-making that involves interagency coördination and input from interested parties.

“Icahn was always talking about an ‘executive order’—that was his vernacular,” Dinneen recalled. An official in the Trump Administration told me that reports about an impending executive order were “not true,” because “there was no organic executive-order process that would be normal for something like that.” There was a draft executive order, the official acknowledged, but it did not originate in the White House: “It was something Icahn sent to us.”

“Icahn is very sophisticated,” Brooke Coleman said. “But maybe not about Washington.” Senator Chuck Grassley not only represents corn growers; he also chairs the Judiciary Committee, which helps confirm Trump’s appointments of judges. This is the reason that traditional policy negotiations are so overcrowded. Washington is a city of vying constituencies, many of which happen to be very powerful. Coleman believes that “someone probably walked into Trump’s office and said, ‘Here’s why you need Chuck Grassley more than you need Carl Icahn.’ ”

Did Icahn think that he could bluff his way to a change in federal regulation? One thing is clear: whatever the White House might say, Dinneen believed that Icahn was negotiating on behalf of the Trump Administration. Icahn has boasted to associates in New York about his access to the President. On March 1st, in a filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission, Icahn Enterprises made a point of mentioning that “Mr. Icahn is currently serving as a special advisor to President Donald J. Trump on issues relating to regulatory reform.” Such a disclosure could indicate merely that Icahn is being transparent with his shareholders. But it is also, unequivocally, a signal: I have the ear of the President.

Richard Painter, who served as the chief ethics lawyer for George W. Bush, told me that it was irrelevant whether or not Icahn received a salary or had an office in the West Wing. “When you give someone a title, you make him your agent,” Painter said. He pointed out that Icahn’s title stood out amid the arid nomenclature of official Washington, where “special advisers” proliferate but only a chosen few can append the words “to the President.” “With a title like that, he has the authority to represent the President’s views. If he goes out and says ‘The President thinks this,’ that means something.”

If Icahn’s objective was to shift the point of obligation, his bluff failed. This would appear to be an instance in which the same lattice of vested interests that can cause dysfunction in Washington actually led to a proper result; it prevented a hasty change in policy that was designed primarily to assist one person. “The process worked, at the end of the day,” the Trump Administration official told me. “We made the right decision.”

Mark Stevens, Icahn’s biographer, recalled, “Carl once told me, ‘I don’t believe in the word fair. It’s a human concept that became conventional wisdom.’ ” To Icahn, it may have seemed that the roadblocks he faced were not a sign of a sound bureaucracy but, rather, evidence of a power play by more formidable special interests, in the form of the ethanol lobby and Big Oil.

But Icahn’s first foray as a Presidential adviser was by no means a complete failure. Icahn had spent the second half of 2016 complaining bitterly about CVR’s obligation to buy RIN s. But, when CVR released an earnings report in April, 2017, it emerged that the company had actually been selling them. Reuters subsequently reported that, when the price of RIN s was high, CVR sold millions of the credits. The company would eventually need to turn over its quota of credits to the E.P.A., yet in the months before its annual deadline it was quietly selling them off. This was extremely unusual. “To my knowledge, this is the first time you had someone taking a short position in the RIN market,” Tristan Brown, the SUNY professor, told me.

To short a stock or a commodity is to make a bet that the price will drop. And in this instance it was extremely risky: if the deadline arrives and a refiner does not have the required quota of credits, the E.P.A. can enforce fines of $37,500 a day for each RIN owed until the refiner complies—a figure that would climb into the billions of dollars immediately. “You’re essentially gambling,” Brown said. “And, if you’re wrong, the penalty is pretty much unlimited.” This was, Brown said, not the sort of speculative play one might anticipate from a mid-sized refiner like CVR. Rather, it was the kind of gamble that a bold Wall Street investor might make.

In the near term, at least, Icahn’s bet paid off. As soon as the news broke that an executive order on the point of obligation was imminent—and that Icahn and Dinneen had reached a deal—prices of RIN s plummeted. Jim Stock, a professor at Harvard who studies the energy sector, pointed out that “if an individual has influence over expectations in this market, he can end up moving prices.” When RIN prices dropped, it afforded CVR an opportunity to cover its short, buying back the RIN s it needed to meet its regulatory obligation at a steep discount.

Because CVR will not comment on the trades, it is impossible to know how many credits were bought during this period. Normally, the refiner posted a loss for the sum that it spent on RIN s each quarter, and those losses had lately amounted to as much as sixty million dollars. But, on a shareholder call in April, a CVR representative said that in the first quarter of the Trump Administration the company had experienced a “negative” loss of six million dollars—that is, a profit. Tristan Brown told me that the notion of a profit resulting from compliance with the Renewable Fuel Standard was unheard of for a merchant refiner like CVR. When I asked a longtime RIN trader about this gambit, he said, “Either Icahn was extremely lucky or he knew something that other people didn’t.”

“So, what are you doing?” Icahn asked me when I called him for this story. For all his brusque qualities, Icahn is an engaging interlocutor, his voice a raspy staccato, his accent a time capsule of old New York. In the course of three phone calls, we spoke for nearly four hours. Icahn has given hundreds of interviews over the decades. He is a great raconteur. But, on the subject of his role as an adviser to Trump and his effort to change the E.P.A. regulation, he preferred to talk almost entirely off the record. A lawyer joined him for each call. Icahn insisted to me that he does not oppose all regulation, and feels, for example, that “some Wall Street regulation is necessary.” Notwithstanding the title that Trump had conferred on him, Icahn described his advisory role as “unofficial,” and said, “I have only ever made suggestions that I believed would benefit all companies in particular industries, never any one particular company.” Beyond that, he would say little on the record.

Icahn was less guarded when his appointment originally generated controversy. “I own a refinery,” he told Bloomberg News, in March. “Why shouldn’t I advocate?” He later added, “I have a right to talk to the President like any other citizen. . . . And, yeah, it helps me. I’m not apologizing for that.” With me, he was more calibrated, insisting that his role has been overstated, and that he has spoken to Trump only “a handful” of times since the election.

Confronted with Dinneen’s account of their interactions, Icahn deferred to his lawyer, Jesse Lynn, who disputed several points. Although Dinneen was adamant that Icahn had assured him an executive order was in the works, and had spoken of discussing the matter with Trump, Lynn told me that Icahn had merely expressed “hope” that Trump would come around to his view. Lynn also denied the White House’s account, maintaining that the draft executive order was not prepared by Icahn.

I spoke to someone who has seen the draft executive order, and he told me that it looked conspicuously like something that had been prepared by someone with no experience in Washington: “It was like ‘I, the President, instruct Scott Pruitt to move the point of obligation.’ It was almost amateurish. Any policy person or lawyer would understand that this thing was never going to fly.”

Several sources in Washington who have discussed the matter with Mike Catanzaro, the Trump Administration official who dealt with Icahn, told me that, once he and Gary Cohn had concluded that Icahn was attempting to hijack the policy process, they put a stop to it. One of the sources said, “I think Icahn thought if he told his pal Don, ‘This is a bad thing,’ and explained why it was stupid, Don would say, ‘God damn it, Carl, you’re right!’—and then the law would change. That’s not how it works down here. We have this thing called the Administrative Procedure Act.” Another source said, “Mike had to make clear that the government is not a vending machine—that it’s not here to profit the President’s friends.” He added, “Not everybody in this Administration necessarily sees it that way.”

Icahn would not acknowledge having directed CVR to short RIN s. Jesse Lynn said that CVR’s strategies on RIN s are decided by its board of directors. (He did not mention that the chairman of the board is Icahn.) On the question of whether Icahn had exploited his proximity to the President to make bets in the marketplace, Lynn said, “Any suggestion that we had access to information that others didn’t is unequivocally false.” Neither Icahn nor Lynn would comment further on the trading of RIN s, but Icahn told me, “I have a decades-long, impeccable record of creating literally hundreds of billions of dollars of value for shareholders. I’ve lived through many turbulent times but I’ve never had any problems with the government.” He added that he has “a great respect for the law,” and that he and his associates “cross every ‘t’ and dot every ‘i’ in our activities.”

These assurances notwithstanding, Icahn could be in legal jeopardy. “He’s walking right into possible criminal charges,” Richard Painter, the Bush Administration ethics lawyer, said. He cited a federal statute that makes it illegal for executive-branch employees to work on any matter in which they may have a direct financial interest. The President and the Vice-President are exempted from this statute. Unpaid White House advisers are not. Painter suggested that the public-integrity division of the Justice Department should be investigating. “If I were Icahn’s private lawyer, I would tell him that he shouldn’t have accepted the special-adviser title,” he said. Jesse Lynn told me that he has reviewed the relevant law, and that it does not apply to Icahn: “Unlike a government employee, Mr. Icahn has no official role or duties and he is not in a position to set policy.”

Painter disagrees. “That is clearly an official title,” he said. “If he was advising on a matter where he had an interest, then Icahn was in direct violation of the criminal statute.”

The Trump Justice Department may be unlikely to initiate an investigation. But Eliot Spitzer, the former prosecutor and New York governor, told me that Icahn’s activities in Washington should also draw scrutiny in New York. “At a minimum, it looks improper,” he said. “If I were sitting downtown at 120 Broadway, where I used to be the state attorney general, and somebody presented this fact pattern to me, I would say, ‘Let’s take a hard look at this.’ Giving policy advice as a formal government adviser while at the same time trading on the potential impact of that advice violates our notions of transparency in government work. It seems problematic on its face.”

In March, Icahn published an article in The Hill, defending himself against any suggestion that, as a private citizen lobbying the Administration on behalf of his own business interests, he might be expected to register as a lobbyist. “I have vetted my activities with a number of lawyers and it is clear that no registration is required,” he wrote. He argued that it was not merely refiners like CVR that were suffering under the current point of obligation; so were mom-and-pop gas stations, many of which were “minority owned.” Icahn argued, with a straight face, that he was actually fighting this battle on behalf of minority communities. The investor who has negotiated with Icahn told me, “Carl confuses the personal good and the social good in a very profound way.”

Following the reports that Icahn was negotiating with Dinneen and urging Trump to shift the point of obligation, Icahn acknowledged, in March, that he had not been buying RIN s. Jesse Lynn insisted that there was “nothing unusual or inappropriate about any RIN s trading that may have been conducted.” Icahn had no ability to influence policy at the White House, Lynn insisted. All that his title and his relationship with the President afforded was “an opportunity to express his views.”

One recurring feature of the Trump Presidency has been an acute collective sensation, shared by a substantial portion of the electorate, of helpless witness. Dismayed Americans wait, like spectators at a game that has turned suddenly dangerous, for a referee to step in and cry foul. But one reason that Trumpism is so transfixing to watch is that it is about the upending of norms, the defiance of taboos, the destabilization of institutions. School’s out forever. What this means in practice is a serious deficit of accountability. Whom can you call when the authorities are the ones breaking the rules?

Since Icahn’s appointment, Senators Elizabeth Warren, of Massachusetts, and Sheldon Whitehouse, of Rhode Island, along with several of their Democratic colleagues, have written a string of letters to the White House and to various agencies to protest the nature of Icahn’s role, and to seek clarity on the question of what he has actually been doing. Whitehouse told me that, because of the “definitional murk” surrounding Icahn’s appointment, it is important to answer a series of baseline questions. How often has he consulted with Trump or others at the White House? Has his position provided access to confidential government information that might affect his investments? How broad an array of regulations has Icahn offered advice on, and how have his recommendations dovetailed with his own portfolio?

I asked several people who know Icahn whether he even has policy interests beyond his own investments. They noted Icahn’s commitment to education—he has built eight charter schools in the Bronx—but struggled to offer other examples. Someone who used to work for Icahn told me, “Carl has zero interest in the details of regulation. He has a general feeling that he doesn’t want regulations to affect him, but it’s not like he’s going to be consulting the Federal Register and making policy recommendations. It’s ludicrous.” When a Bloomberg reporter pressed Icahn about sectors beyond oil refining where he felt that regulation was excessive, he spoke of railcars and liquid natural gas—two heavily regulated industries in which Icahn has extensive holdings.

In May, after the revelations about the RIN trading by CVR, the senators wrote to the heads of the S.E.C., the E.P.A., and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission, calling on them to investigate. But it could not have escaped the senators’ attention that two recipients of their letter—Jay Clayton and Scott Pruitt—had met with Icahn in the context of securing their jobs. The Senate Democrats cannot issue subpoenas to agencies unless they get the Republican majority to sign on—an unlikely outcome. In May, the C.F.T.C. replied to the senators’ letter: the agency would not be investigating Icahn or CVR, because RIN s, even though they are commodities, do not trade on a futures market, and the agency therefore had no jurisdiction to look into the matter. By this logic, the fifteen-billion-dollar market for renewable-fuel credits is not regulated by any government agency.

In the absence of disclosures about what Icahn has and has not advised on, any investment that he makes in a regulated industry can come to seem suspicious. In February, he acquired a stake in the pharmaceutical giant Bristol-Myers Squibb. During Jay Clayton’s confirmation hearings, Elizabeth Warren noted that Icahn had made this move after assuming his role as a special adviser to the President. The value of a company like Bristol-Myers would be affected by Food and Drug Administration decisions, patent determinations, and policies that affect Medicare and Medicaid, she pointed out. It is almost impossible to imagine, she argued, that Icahn did not “have some inside information about how these policies would affect a company like Bristol-Myers.” Warren posed a hypothetical to Clayton: If Icahn had inside information about federal regulatory policy that would affect Bristol-Myers, and he chose to buy shares in the company based on that information, would that not be a violation of securities laws?

Clayton demurred, saying that it would depend on an analysis of the “facts and circumstances.”

“We are talking about an Administration that just has conflicts everywhere,” Warren pressed. “It is very difficult to determine whether someone is actually working in the interests of the American people or they are just lining their own pockets.” The public should not be forced to “guess” whether its government is serving its interests or that of the President’s cronies, she continued. “And when Carl Icahn is influencing policy that will affect companies and then he is investing in those companies . . . that creates a conflict of interest that is just beyond what we are even talking about everywhere else.”

In his conversation with me, Icahn expressed indignation about the effort to hold him accountable, which he has described, in conspicuously Trumpian language, as “fake news” and “a witch hunt.” He told me that any criticism of his role is “both politically motivated and motivated by certain large business interests,” and is “completely without merit.”

When I asked Icahn about the nature of his special-adviser role, he maintained that what had initially appeared to be a broad policy portfolio was, in practice, much more limited. “The only suggestions I have ever made throughout this whole period were on the RIN s issue,” he said. No railcars? No liquid natural gas? Icahn says that he has not had a single conversation with anyone in the Administration about regulations in these industries, or in any others in which he has holdings. He acknowledges advocating on the RIN s issue. But he maintains that this was not problematic, because, though the refiner he owns might benefit from a shift in the point of obligation, it would not be the only company that would welcome such a change. In Icahn’s telling, this makes him practically disinterested.

The White House official who would, in theory, police Icahn’s status is Stefan Passantino, the deputy counsel to the President for compliance and ethics. Passantino was responsible for “counselling” Kellyanne Conway, the Presidential adviser, after she sparked an outcry by promoting Ivanka Trump’s apparel line during a Fox News interview. In the view of Trump Administration officials, Passantino laid to rest the Icahn controversy with his February declaration that Icahn was “simply a private citizen.” Kelly Love, the White House spokeswoman, said, “Mr. Icahn does not have a position with the Administration, nor a policymaking role.”

It is ironic for Passantino to rule on the controversy surrounding Icahn’s conflicts of interest—because Passantino has a conflict of his own. On June 28th, Walter Shaub, the head of the Office of Government Ethics, wrote a letter pointing out that Passantino, in his mandatory disclosures as a full-time White House employee, noted that before joining the Administration he had been a corporate lawyer. He listed the clients for whom he had done work in the two years prior to joining the government. One of them was Icahn. At the time that Passantino was initially queried about the propriety of Icahn’s position, he made no mention of this relationship.

Two weeks after Shaub sent his letter, he resigned, saying that he could no longer meaningfully perform the function for which the Office of Government Ethics was designed. Shaub warned that the United States was facing a “historic ethics crisis.” The White House released a statement lashing out at Shaub, dismissing his concerns as “grandstanding.”

For all of President Trump’s fulminations about the danger of leaks, his White House has a bizarre habit of authorizing spokespeople to talk with the press on the condition that their names not be mentioned. When I asked the White House for an interview with Passantino, to discuss how he had vetted Icahn’s position, a spokeswoman replied that Passantino had been “recused on any matters related to Carl Icahn,” because Icahn was a former client. This was the first I had heard of any recusal, and I asked when it had happened. On the first day of the Administration, the spokeswoman replied.

If the White House spokeswoman was correct, then at the time that Passantino issued the Administration’s judgment that Icahn’s role posed no ethical conflicts he was already recused from offering legal advice on precisely that question. “That’s not how recusal works,” Shaub told me. “Recusing yourself means not delivering the White House’s legal theories about whether Icahn is an employee.” The spokeswoman maintained that, when Passantino made his declaration, he wasn’t making a legal judgment, but “merely reiterating a fact.” Richard Painter, who used to hold Passantino’s job, told me that the White House’s repeated assertion that Icahn is simply a private citizen is “bogus,” adding, “The ethics shop in this White House is not very good.”

If Passantino never weighed in on the terms of Icahn’s unusual appointment, surely some other White House lawyer looked into the matter. I asked who that was. The spokeswoman responded that it “wasn’t necessary” to perform any such legal vetting of Icahn’s role.

For the moment, Icahn’s push on the point of obligation appears to have stalled. But, in July, CVR announced its most recent quarterly results, and once again the firm was spending a great deal of money to purchase RIN s. On a call with investors, CVR’s chief executive, John Lipinski, cited the volatility of RIN prices. “When there’s news in the market, it goes up and it goes down,” he said. Lipinski complained, several times, about speculators who were “manipulating” the price of the credits. When he was asked about CVR’s own speculative trading of RIN s, he said that he didn’t “intend to go into any detail” on such questions. RIN prices, which hit a low of thirty cents following the news of Icahn’s deal with Dinneen, have since tripled. In the coming weeks, the E.P.A. is expected to issue a formal rejection of proposals to shift the point of obligation. According to Reuters, some investors on Wall Street are now betting against Icahn—by shorting CVR stock.

Dinneen, for one, does not anticipate that Icahn will simply let the issue go. “He doesn’t seem like a man who will quit easily,” he said.

Jeff Hauser, who runs the Revolving Door Project, a nonprofit focussed on government corruption, told me that Icahn’s relationship with Trump is a particularly bald example of a kind of clientalist politics that has been more typical, historically, of banana republics, but which is on the rise in the United States. “Once there is an acquiescence that this sort of corruption is acceptable, then you just see the demise of representative government,” Hauser said. “We will essentially become a feudal state, with people creating their own fiefdoms and extracting rents from the public.”

On August 14th, I asked the White House to confirm that Icahn was still a special adviser to the President. The spokeswoman e-mailed me back: “Icahn is NOT ‘a special adviser to the president for regulatory reform.’ ” This was certainly news. In my conversations with Icahn and his lawyer, I had not developed any impression that his status had changed. Was the Administration cutting him loose?

I wrote back to the spokeswoman, asking when Icahn had been let go. She replied, “There was no ‘effective’ end date, because there was never a formal appointment or title after January 20.” This was transparently false; Icahn had been named a special adviser to “the President,” not to “the President-elect.” On March 1st, Icahn’s company told the S.E.C. that he was “currently” a Trump adviser. And why had the White House lawyer, Stefan Passantino, recused himself on January 20th from “any matters related to Carl Icahn” if, as of that very day, Icahn had no role in the Administration?

Instead of simply breaking off a questionable liaison, the White House seems intent on going further, insisting that the liaison never happened in the first place. But, in the event that state or federal investigators do examine the legality of Icahn’s role in the early days of the Trump Administration, this heedless revisionism is unlikely to withstand scrutiny. After all, if Icahn had really been dismissed on the first day of the Administration, it might have behooved the White House to tell Bob Dinneen, or the senators who wrote all those letters. Or Icahn.

On Friday, August 18th, four days after the White House disavowed Icahn to me, he tweeted, “Today, with President Trump’s blessing, I ceased to act as special advisor to the President on issues relating to regulatory reform.” In a letter posted to his Web site, Icahn explained that he had spoken with Trump that day. His resignation came during a week when numerous private-sector advisers distanced themselves from Trump, in response to his equivocal comments in the aftermath of a white-supremacist rally in Charlottesville. But Icahn made no mention of these events, claiming instead, “I chose to end this arrangement,” and citing “the insinuations of a handful of your Democratic critics.” He insisted, “I never had access to nonpublic information or profited from my position, nor do I believe that my role presented conflicts of interests.”

In our conversations, Icahn was unfailingly polite about President Trump. But it struck me that it must vex him that Trump—the lesser intellect, the lesser businessman, the little-brother tagalong—may now be too busy to take his phone calls, and would jettison him from his position as a White House special adviser without so much as a heads-up. If Icahn’s raid on Washington has proved unsuccessful, he cannot blame the scrupulousness of the Trump Administration. The aging takeover artist may have flown a little too close to the sun in his pursuit of a particular political objective, but his failure was itself an illustration of the power of transactional politics in Washington. Trump may want to govern like a businessman. But Washington is a club like any other, with some codes and protocols that even the brashest arrivistes cannot ignore. Trump needed the farmers of Iowa to win the Presidency, and he would need them to win it again. To a businessman like Icahn, it may have seemed that, in the pay-for-play politics of Washington, everything has a price. But reëlection is priceless.

Icahn eventually succeeded in gaining control of the Trump Taj Mahal casino. In 2014, a bankruptcy-court judge expressed concern that Icahn Enterprises would just close the place, and insisted that company executives testify that they had no plans to shut the casino down. Initially, Icahn promised to invest a hundred million dollars in the ailing facility. But he ended up embroiled in yet another bitter union fight, and refused to yield on demands from casino employees for better pay and health benefits. Eventually, Icahn shuttered the casino. “The great dealmaker would rather burn the Trump Taj Mahal down just so he can control the ashes,” Bob McDevitt, the president of the local union, said at the time. “It’s a classic take-the-money-and-run—Icahn takes hundreds of millions of dollars out of Atlantic City and then announces he is closing up shop.” The casino’s demise put three thousand people out of work. In March, 2017, Icahn found a buyer: Hard Rock International. One day earlier this summer, former employees queued up alongside treasure hunters and curious passersby on the boardwalk outside the beleaguered casino. A liquidator had arranged a fire sale of the items inside. People carted home used bed linens and scuffed armchairs and statuary of fake gold. They looked for souvenirs bearing the Trump name, but there weren’t any.

For many years, an odd structure stood down the boardwalk from the Taj Mahal—a three-story rooming house. It had been bought, in 1961, by an eccentric local woman named Vera Coking, who ran it in the manner of a boarding house in a Hitchcock film: cheap rooms for rent, with a shared bathroom down the hall. When the casino boom swept Atlantic City, in the eighties, many suitors came to Coking, hoping to buy her building for the valuable land that it sat on. But Coking, who was stubborn, refused to sell. Donald Trump was one of those suitors. “He’d come over to the house, probably thinking, If I butter her up now, I’ll get her house for a good price,” she told the Daily News, in 1998. “Once, he gave me Neil Diamond tickets. I didn’t even know who Neil Diamond was.” Trump, the great negotiator, could not get Coking to sell. He enlisted the State of New Jersey to invoke eminent domain in order to oust her from her property, but Coking fought in court and prevailed. She derided the future President as “a maggot, a cockroach, and a crumb.”

Finally, in 2014, the house went up for auction. Trump had, by that time, walked away from Atlantic City, and was preparing to run for President. Coking was living in a retirement home in California. The property sold to an unnamed buyer, for five hundred and thirty thousand dollars. The buyer was Carl Icahn. He knocked the house down. ♦

A SERIAL fraudster who posed as a police officer and a solicitor risked vulnerable mums losing the custody of their children in order to con them out of thousands of pounds.

‘Career criminal’ Stephen Davey targeted women living in Warrington who were battling their ex-husbands for care of the kids in the family courts.

Liverpool Crown Court heard today, Thursday, that the 49-year-old began to frequent Legends Sports Bar in the city centre in December 2018.

There, he met a woman who was a friend of the victims – striking up a sexual relationship with her after telling her that he was a police officer and probation worker called Steven Burns.

The conman offered to put one of his partner’s friends, a domestic violence victim who was facing a custody battle with her ex-husband for their five children, in touch with a solicitor called Simon Davey specialising in family law.

But this solicitor was in fact the defendant, who took payments purporting to be for representing her in court and in order to hire a private detective who would investigate her estranged partner.

He later stated that his ex-husband was going to be arrested on suspicion of terrorism offences and possessing indecent images of children, and that he would be deported.

Davey claimed he had won the woman full custody of her kids and a £45,000 compensation claim, but in reality nobody had been present to represent her in court.

Between January and April this year, he took an estimated £8,000 from her – convincing him to give her money which he said he would spend on an engagement ring for his partner, but instead used to buy tickets for Liverpool FC matches.

Davey took £500 which he said he needed for private health scans, claiming he feared he had cancer and that NHS waiting lists were too long.

He also talked this victim into buying a laptop and case for £360 before asking to borrow the computer for work and never returned it, while a PlayStation 4 and television she bought for nearly £600 were pawned at Cash Converters.

Another friend of the woman Davey had seduced was going through family court proceedings against her ex-husband.

She paid the fake solicitor persona he had created £475 in order to apply for a restraining order against her former partner – who had also subjected her to domestic abuse – but no such application was ever made.

The defendant even forged emails purporting to be from Warrington Borough Council ’s executive director of families and wellbeing Steve Peddie and Merseyside Police chief constable Andy Cook as part of his scam.

None of the three women targeted by Davey can be named for legal reasons.

Defence barrister Tom Watson told the court that his client had left school with no qualifications and had worked for the ambulance service, but was made redundant.

Since 2015, he has been studying criminology and psychology with the Open University and had volunteered with the probation service.

Davey had volunteered with the probation service and had hoped to gain employment in this area, but a job offer he received was later withdrawn.

Mr Watson added: “He does accept that these victims have suffered as a result of what he’s done and he does not wish them to suffer any further.

“This court will look at his record and see something of a life of crime, and a life of a particular type of crime – he does not attempt to deny that, but seeks to give an explanation for his continued behaviour.

“His criminal behaviour began when he lost his job and he couldn’t pay his mortgage, and he turned to fraud – he got into a life of behaving like that.

“He regards himself as having no worth, and his criminal record which has grown and grown is something which he is disgusted with and not proud of.

“When the offer of employment was withdrawn he went off the rails and moved back into his old behaviour.

“It sounds shallow and hollow, but he does offer his apologies to the victims in this case – he knows his behaviour and actions have had this impact upon them, and they are right to be distressed and upset.

“Though he has a record that does him no favours at all, his remorse is genuine.”

Judge Robert Warnock handed Davey – who had only been released from prison for fraud offences in London weeks before he hatched his latest callous scheme – four years behind bars.

Sentencing, judge Warnock said: “This was a concentrated campaign of fraud against two vulnerable women.

“Shortly after you were released from prison, you targeted your two victims, each of whom were mothers to young children.

“This case involves six young children involved in contested family court proceedings.

“You created two false personas, purporting to be a probation officers and police officer as well as working for a solicitors firm specialising in family law.

“Neither persona existed – you convinced them that you were working on their behalf, but you extorted money from them.

“The real harm in this cause is the effect it had upon the cases involving these children.

“You are an imbued dishonest fraudster who has been committing these kind of offences for a long time – you have a total of 94 offences with 17 convictions, starting in 1987.

“Your modus operandi was extensive, complicated and nationwide.

“The time has come for you to stop committing fraud and to stop doing harm to others.”

Davey – who was also handed a restraining order banning him from contacting his victims for 10 years – is now due to face a Proceeds of Crime Act hearing in the New Year back at Liverpool Crown Court, where he could be ordered to pay back his ill-gotten gains.

He is also barred from entering the Tune Hotel in Liverpool – where he stayed for nearly a year, but did not pay for his accommodation.

The dad-of-two left his possession in his hotel after being rumbled by staff, with investigating officers discovering items including a fake police lanyard among other items used in the fraud.

Prosecution barrister Nardeen Nemat said following the sentencing: “Stephen Davey is a serial fraudster whose behaviour showed a disregard for the havoc and heartache he created in the lives of the people he conned.

“The women thought he was trying to help them with difficult family problems, yet he just made things so much worse.

“By telling the women that his ‘solicitor friend’ was dealing with the family court matters and that they didn’t need to attend court, he could have derailed their hopes of maintaining custody of their children.

“His behaviour was reckless and heartless.

“Thankfully, the women found the courage and perseverance to support this prosecution and help the Crown Prosecution Service build a strong case – so strong that Davey pleaded guilty at an early stage.

“The Crown Prosecution Service would like to thank these women for their help in this case and wishes them well for the future.”

Detective constable Laura Gilbert added: “This has been a complex and wide-ranging investigation spanning multiple force areas.

“Stephen Davey is a manipulative and despicable individual who has knowingly preyed on extremely vulnerable victims.

“He is a career criminal whose only motivation throughout was to extort as much money as he could from his victims.

“I would like to thank the victims and witnesses in this case for coming forward and exposing his predatory behaviour, and for the bravery they have shown in doing so.

“They have played a vital role in Davey being brought to justice for his crimes.

“When arrested and interviewed Davey completely denied the offences, and showed absolutely no remorse.

“His offending showed significant premeditation and he attempted to cover his tracks at every turn.

“I am pleased that this case has been brought to a swift conclusion for the sake of the victims and I hope that the sentence imposed will motivate Davey to reflect on his behaviour going forward.”",fraud and theft
TMML2024034065666,Rami Makhluf,"Alert ID: TMML2024034065666
Among the international figures named in the “ Panama Papers,” the trove of more than 11 million leaked financial and legal documents made public over the weekend, is the richest man in Syria, Rami Makhlouf.

Makhlouf, 46, is a cousin and close friend of Syrian President Bashar Assad. He's also one of the most hated men in the country. His flagrant corruption helped spark Syria’s 2011 uprising, when protesters attacked his businesses and chanted "" Rami Makhlouf is robbing us.""

He sure was. Makhlouf exploited his close connections to the Assad regime to amass a fortune of some $5 billion and control some 60 percent of the Syrian economy. In 2011, Reuters reported that Makhlouf had total or partial monopolies in Syria’s telecommunications, real estate, oil, airline, duty free, construction and import sectors. Any foreigner who wanted to do business in Syria had to go through Makhlouf, analysts say.

The 11.5 million leaked documents from the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca, obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists and the German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung and published on Sunday, together make up the largest-ever data leak about offshore companies. They shed more light on how Makhlouf stashed his cash overseas with the help of foreign business partners.

Mossack Fonseca set up and ran several companies owned by Makhlouf that were registered in the British Virgin Islands, where it's relatively easy to hide cash from tax, regulatory and criminal authorities. Makhlouf's businesses appear to be classic “shell” companies -- financial entities that don't really do anything in their own right, instead mainly serving as places through which to move money.

The U.S. has been chasing Makhlouf’s wealth since at least 2008, when it banned American companies from dealing with him or his businesses because of his role fueling corruption in Syria. Analysts believe that Makhlouf serves as Assad’s “bagman,"" managing the president’s own ill-gotten gains.

The Panama Papers reveal that international banks and law firms kept working with Makhlouf and other regime allies in spite of U.S. sanctions and as war broke out in Syria.

Mossack Fonseca rejected the advice of its own compliance department to cut off the Syrian tycoon in 2011, as protesters took to the streets to decry the regime. Despite years of U.S. sanctions, one partner in the firm dismissed the claims against Makhlouf as ""rumors."" He defended the decision based on the advice of U.K.-headquartered bank HSBC, whose role as Makhlouf’s banker was revealed in previous leaks and prompted a U.S. Senate investigation.

After the Syrian regime responded to the protests with deadly force, and the European Union imposed sanctions on Makhlouf and other members of regime in mid-2011, HSBC and Mossack Fonseca finally cut ties with him.

""We did not know this individual until his name and association were reported in the media,"" Mossack Fonseca said of Makhlouf in a statement following the leaks. ""While we were the registered agent for a company that, as we later discovered, was resold to him, we did not deal with him directly. Due to the banking secrecy laws in Switzerland we did not have access to information regarding the final beneficiary of the company in question.""

The law firm has denied that the Panama Papers establish any wrongdoing, noting that there is nothing illegal about setting up offshore companies. The Guardian notes that there are legitimate reasons why people might want anonymity, or to protect their money overseas.

Still, the scale of the practice is staggering. One 2012 study reported that at least $21 trillion, and perhaps as much as $31 trillion, has been parked in offshore accounts to put it beyond the reach of various authorities, and Mossack Fonseca itself says it has set up more than 240,000 offshore companies. The Panama Papers reveal that Mossack's clients include more than 143 world leaders, officials and their relatives, as well sports stars, arms dealers and drug lords. Icelandic Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson stepped down on Tuesday after revelations about his offshore dealings sparked massive protests.

Makhlouf’s country cannot, for now, hold him accountable. Syria has spent the past four years imploding after protests against corruption and repression were crushed, and today is embroiled in a complicated, brutal war with nearly half a million casualties to date.

If Rami Makhlouf symbolizes corruption in Syria, his brother Hafez symbolizes repression.

Hafez Makhlouf is the 45-year-old former Damascus branch chief of a Syrian intelligence agency called the General Security Directorate. When the U.S. imposed sanctions on him in May 2011, the Treasury said Hafez Makhlouf had a “leading role in responding to protests in Syria,” including the deadly crackdowns on protesters from the first days of the uprising.

Hafez was also named in the Panama Papers as the director of yet another company registered in the British Virgin Islands by Mossack Fonseca.

In Assad’s Syria, corruption and repression work hand in hand. The Makhlouf brothers are a striking example of the dirty dealings of the regime's inner circle.

Rami Makhlouf used the intelligence apparatus run by his brother to intimidate his business rivals. One prominent economist, who criticized authorities for giving Rami a contract to set up the country’s largest cell phone operator, ended up spending seven years in jail.

It’s not totally clear how the brothers have fared since the war.

At the start of the uprising, Rami Makhlouf reportedly angered Assad by warning in an interview with The New York Times that the regime would fight to the death for its survival. Shortly after, Makhlouf declared that he would quit business and donate his profits to charity. But most Syrians didn’t believe him, and last June a Swiss court rejected Makhlouf's attempt to unfreeze his assets in the country, expressing skepticism that he'd actually dissociated himself from the regime as he claimed.

Hafez Makhlouf, meanwhile, lost his intelligence post in 2014, and was later reported to have left Syria for Belarus or Russia. Unlike his brother, he was able to persuade a Swiss court in 2012 to unfreeze some $3 million he was holding in the country.

The leaks also show that Mossack Fonseca helped Syrian companies that worked with the regime as the war escalated.

The law firm helped three Syrian companies that were blacklisted by the U.S. to create front companies in the Seychelles, according to the French newspaper and ICIJ media partner Le Monde. The companies were sanctioned for selling fuel to the Assad regime that could potentially have been used in the warplanes terrorizing Syrian towns and cities. Mossack Fonseca kept working with one of the companies associated with the regime, Pangates International, nine months after sanctions were imposed in July 2014, according to the documents.",

South Africa has issued an arrest warrant for Zimbabwe’s former first lady Grace Mugabe in relation to an alleged assault on a woman in a hotel in Johannesburg last year.

Gabriella Engels accused Mugabe of beating the “hell out” of her with an electrical extension cord in a room at the Capital 20 West hotel in Johannesburg’s Sandton district. After the alleged assault came to light in August 2017, the South African government granted Mugabe diplomatic immunity. That immunity was overturned by a court this year after Engels, a model, challenged the decision.

“I can confirm that a warrant for the arrest of Grace Mugabe was issued last Thursday,” said Vishnu Naidoo, a spokesman for South Africa’s police service. He said police were seeking Interpol’s help to enforce the warrant.

There was no immediate comment from Grace Mugabe.

The two countries have an extradition agreement, but Zimbabwe’s deputy minister for information, Energy Mutodi, told Reuters that Harare would not extradite Mugabe.

“I believe the government of Zimbabwe will not tolerate any harassment or degrading treatment on the former president Mugabe and his immediate family members,” Mutodi said, adding that he would need to consult with President Emmerson Mnangagwa on a final decision.

Grace Mugabe, 53, was seen as a potential successor to her 94-year-old husband, Robert Mugabe, who ruled Zimbabwe from 1980 until he was ousted in a coup late last year.

She has denied assaulting Engels with an extension cord, saying an “intoxicated and unhinged” Engels attacked her with a knife after going to see the Mugabe’s sons at the hotel. The South African advocacy group AfriForum, which represented Engels, has accused Mugabe of lying.

Mugabe has retreated from the limelight in Zimbabwe since her husband was ousted. Elections in August were won by Mnangagwa, his former righthand man in the ruling Zanu-PF party.

The warrant comes days after a long-awaited report into the killing of six people by soldiers during a post-elections protest in Harare. On Thursday, opposition figures dismissed the inquiry’s findings as “an effort to whitewash the killing of innocent lives”.

Set up by Mnangagwa, the inquiry found that the military and police were responsible for the deaths, but that the deployment of troops had been lawful after the police had been overwhelmed by protesters. The protests were “pre-planned and orchestrated” and leaders from the main opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), had incited violence, the report added.

It recommended that soldiers should face “internal” disciplinary measures if found to have broken their codes of conduct.

Jacob Mafume, a spokesperson for the MDC, described the inquiry’s conclusions as “bizarre”, telling the Guardian: “They say it’s the MDC that incited violence yet blame the military for shooting the people.”

Opposition leaders have denied the charge of incitement.

The violence followed relatively peaceful elections and caused significant political difficulties for Mnangagwa’s government, which has made strenuous attempts to convince the international community that Zanu-PF has forgone the repression and brutality it was accused of during its 38 years in power under Mugabe.

The inquiry spent three months investigating the circumstances surrounding the shootings, interviewing dozens of witnesses.

Despite widely published photographs and video footage that showed members of the Zimbabwean army firing on people, generals said under oath they did not believe troops had shot at people.

Brig Gen Anselem Sanyatwe, the commander of the elite presidential guard, told a hearing investigating the killings that “if any gunshot wounds were sustained by the victims, it was not from my men”.

Mnangagwa said his government would study the report before deciding on its next steps.",arrest warrant

Malaysia’s anti-corruption agency has charged the former prime minister Najib Razak with three counts of money laundering as part of its investigation into the multi-billion dollar 1MDB scandal.

The charges – which Najib denies – relate to three transfers totalling 42m ringgit (US$10m) into his bank accounts from SRC International, a former unit of the 1MDB fund that US investigators say was looted of billions by Najib’s associates.

A money laundering offence carries a penalty of a jail term of up to 15 years and a fine of at least fives times the value of the proceeds of any illegal transfers, or 5m ringgit, whichever is the higher.

Najib arrived at the courthouse in a four-car motorcade accompanied by his children. He was dressed in a grey suit and sat in the dock looking calm.

Last month Najib pleaded not guilty to abuse of power and three counts of criminal breach of trust, just two months after the allegation led to his stunning election defeat.

He and his wife, Rosmah Mansor, have been barred from leaving the country since he lost an election in May, and the new prime minister, his mentor-turned-foe Mahathir Mohamad, relaunched an investigation into 1MDB.

The 1MDB corruption scandal, described as the biggest in Malaysia’s history, saw billions of dollars allegedly embezzled and lavishly spent around the globe on luxury property, a private yacht, Hollywood films and extravagant shopping sprees.

Lawsuits filed in US courts by the Department of Justice allege that an estimated $4.5bn was misappropriated from 1MDB by high-level officials of the fund and their associates. 1MDB is being investigated by at least six countries including Singapore, Switzerland and the US.

Najib has consistently denied the charges, telling local news portal Malaysiakini in June that his trial would be a “test” for the Malaysian judiciary. “I believe in my innocence. Therefore the only way I can clear my name is through a system that is fair and a system that is predicated on the rule of law,” he said. “Everybody [should have] a chance to prove themselves under the system.”",

BEIJING (Reuters) - China will try Gu Kailai, the wife of ousted Politburo member Bo Xilai, on charges of murdering a British man, state media said on Thursday in the latest turn in a scandal that has rocked the government in Beijing and could bring Gu the death penalty.

The contentious dismissal of Bo has already shaken the Communist Party’s looming once-in-a-decade succession, and now Gu and family aide Zhang Xiaojun will be prosecuted for allegedly poisoning businessman Neil Heywood last year over “conflict of economic interests”, the official Xinhua news agency said.

“The facts of the two defendants’ crime are clear, and the evidence is irrefutable and substantial,” said the Xinhua report summarizing the indictment. “Therefore, the two defendants should be charged with intentional homicide.”

Gu and Zhang will face trial in Hefei, a city in eastern China, far from Chongqing, the sprawling municipality in the southwest where Bo made his political base and where Heywood died in a hillside hotel in November.

Bo has not been named as a suspect in the murder case, but he is separately under investigation by party authorities and could also face trial at a later time.

Political observers have said a failure to forge a unified stance on handling the divisive Bo case could affect the Communist Party’s focus on working out the leadership changes that will be decided at the upcoming congress.

Bo, the 62-year-old party chief of Chongqing before his dismissal, was widely seen as pushing for a spot in that new leadership until felled by the scandal brought to light by his former police chief, Wang Lijun.

“As big as this case is, the party congress will now proceed quite smoothly,” said Joseph Fewsmith, a professor of Chinese politics at Boston University.

“The party has handled this case as one of one person breaking the law. The ideological issues have been pushed to the side, although that doesn’t mean they’re not there.”

TRIAL SEEN IN EARLY AUGUST

Xinhua did not give a date for the trial, but Shen Zhigeng, a lawyer who had been employed by Gu’s family, told Reuters that her trial was likely to start on August 7 or 8. China’s party-run courts rarely find in favor of defendants, and Gu and Zhang could face the death penalty.

In London, the British Foreign Office responded to news of the indictment by saying it was glad the investigation was continuing.

“The details of the ongoing investigation are a matter for the Chinese authorities,” it added in a statement.

“However we are glad to see that the Chinese authorities are continuing with the investigation into the death of Neil Heywood. We are dedicated to seeking justice for him and his family and we will be following developments closely,” it added.

The indictment comes around a week after Frenchman Patrick Henri Devillers, 52, flew from Cambodia to China to serve as a witness in the case. Devillers was detained last month in Cambodia at the behest of Beijing because of his suspected business links to Gu.

Bo and his wife have had no chance publicly to address the accusations against them since Bo was ousted from his Chongqing post in March.

But shortly before his dismissal, Bo said that he and his family had been the victims of slanderous accusations by foes of his policies, especially his controversial crackdown on organized crime. Since Bo’s sacking, supporters of his left-leaning policies and rhetoric have continued to argue that he is the victim of a political plot.

The removal of Bo has triggered rifts and uncertainty, disrupting the Communist Party’s usually secretive and carefully choreographed process of settling on a new central leadership in the run up to the 18th Party Congress.

The congress, scheduled to be held late this year, possibly in October, will appoint that leadership. President Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao will then step down from their government posts at the National People’s Congress in early 2013, when Vice President Xi Jinping is likely to succeed Hu as president.

“This just shows that the Party has put the Bo Xilai case behind. It shows the center is on top of this case and the whole Party’s priority is the party congress,” Wang Zhengxu, senior research fellow at the School of Contemporary Chinese Studies, University of Nottingham, said of Gu’s indictment.

Gu has been in police custody for months on suspicion of committing or arranging Heywood’s murder, though no details of the motive or the crime itself have been publicly released, other than a general comment from Chinese state media that he was killed after a financial dispute.

Xinhua said that the economic dispute between Gu and Heywood involved her son.

After his dismissal from the Chongqing post, Bo was suspended from the party’s top ranks in April, when Gu was named as a suspect in the November 2011 murder of Heywood.

The businessman was a long-time friend of the couple whose son had earlier studied in England with the help of Heywood. The son, Bo Guagua, graduated from Harvard University this year and is still believed to be in the United States.

Since Bo was ousted, he and Gu, formerly a powerful lawyer, have disappeared from public view.

“Bo’s career has been over for a long time,” said Fewsmith, the professor of Chinese politics.

“I don’t think it’s a surprise,” he said of the indictment of Gu, “because it’s pretty clear that they wanted to get the Gu Kailai case out of the way before the party congress.”",charged with intentional homicide

WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of the Treasury today designated four members of Hizballah’s leadership responsible for operations throughout the Middle East, further exposing Hizballah’s pernicious activities that reach beyond the borders of Lebanon. These designations include senior members of Hizballah responsible for activities ranging from assisting fighters from Iraq to support the Assad regime in Syria, to making payments to various factions within Yemen, and to military leaders responsible for terrorist operations in Egypt, Jordan, Turkey, Cyprus, Israel, the Palestinian territories, and Iraq.

Belying Hizballah’s claim to be a domestic Lebanese “resistance” organization, its expansive global network seeks to extend its malign influence, and the influence of Hizballah’s patron Iran, throughout the Middle East and beyond. The Treasury Department will continue to combat Hizballah’s terrorist activity inside and outside Lebanon with all available tools and will continue to work with partners around the world to make it clear that Hizballah’s militant and extremist activities should not be tolerated by any nation.

“Whether ferrying foreign fighters to the front lines of the Syrian civil war or inserting clandestine operatives in Europe, the Middle East, and elsewhere, Hizballah remains a significant global terrorist threat,” said Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence David S. Cohen. “So long as Hizballah spreads instability, conducts terrorist attacks and engages in criminal and illicit activities around the world, we will continue to sanction Hizballah’s operatives, leaders and businesses, wherever they may be found.”

The individuals sanctioned today were designated pursuant to Executive Order 13224, which targets terrorists and their supporters for acting for, or on behalf of Hizballah. U.S. persons are generally prohibited from engaging in any transactions with the individuals designated today, and any assets of those designees subject to U.S. jurisdiction are frozen.

Khalil Harb

In the years prior to Israel’s withdrawal from southern Lebanon in 2000, Khalil Harb served as the deputy commander for Hizballah’s central military unit’s southern Lebanon region from 1988 to 1992, and as the commander for this region from 1992 to 1994. From 1994 to 1997, Harb served as the commander of Hizballah’s central military operations. By 2000, Harb supervised Hizballah military operations inside Israel, Jordan, Cyprus, and Turkey.

In late November 2000, Harb was given responsibility for overseeing work of the Islamic Resistance, including assisting with the smuggling of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad operatives from Syria into the West Bank via Jordan. By late 2003, Harb was head of the Syrian/Jordan/Israel/Egypt operations unit, which was subordinate to Hizballah’s Islamic Jihad council.

In March 2006, Harb served as Hizballah’s chief of military liaison with the Palestinian factions and Iran, dealing almost exclusively with Palestinians and Iranians inside and outside the territories. Prior to this posting, Harb had served as Hizballah’s chief of military special operations. During the summer of 2006, Harb was given command of a Hizballah special operations unit in southern Lebanon, which engaged the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) in July 2006, at the Lebanese-Israeli border where IDF Special Forces entered Lebanon. In early 2007, Khalil Harb was chief of Hizballah’s Unit 1800, also known as Hizballah’s Nun Unit, the Hizballah entity responsible for supporting Palestinian militants and conducting Hizballah operations in the countries surrounding Israel, and he travelled to Iran for meetings regarding coordination between Hizballah, Iran, and the Palestinians.

In February 2010, Harb, serving as the leader of the Palestinian activities for Hizballah, planned unspecified attacks against Israeli officials in Israel, in retaliation for the assassination of former Hizballah External Security Organization (ESO) chief Imad Mughniyah. By mid-May 2010, Hizballah created a new position for Harb as “advisor to the Secretary General,” which provided Harb oversight of Hizballah Unit 1800, which he previously commanded.

As of 2012, Harb was responsible for Hizballah’s Yemen activities and was involved in the political side of Hizballah’s Yemen portfolio. Harb also served as commander of a Lebanon-based Hizballah special unit that focused on Israel. Since the summer of 2012, Harb has been involved in the movement of large amounts of currency to Yemen, through Saudi Arabia and the U.A.E., and in late 2012, Harb advised the leader of a Yemeni political party that the party’s monthly Hizballah funding of $50,000 was ready for pick up.

Muhammad Kawtharani

As the individual in charge of Hizballah's Iraq activities, Kawtharani has worked on behalf of Hizballah's leadership to promote the group's interests in Iraq, including Hizballah efforts to provide training, funding, political, and logistical support to Iraqi Shi'a insurgent groups. A member of Hizballah's Political Council, Kawtharani also helped secure the release from Iraqi custody of Hizballah operative Ali Musa Daqduq, a senior Hizballah commander designated by the Treasury Department in November 2012 who was responsible for numerous attacks against Coalition Force in Iraq, including planning a January 20, 2007 attack on the Karbala Joint Provincial Coordination Center that resulted in the deaths of five U.S. soldiers.

Over the last year, Kawtharani has assisted in getting fighters to Syria to support the Assad regime.

Muhammad Yusuf Ahmad Mansur

Muhammad Yusuf Ahmad Mansur (Mansur), a member of Hizballah since at least 1986, once served in a Hizballah military unit operating in south Lebanon. Around 2004, Mansur was transferred to Hizballah’s Unit 1800. Mansur was subsequently dispatched to Egypt to work with Unit 1800 under Muhammad Qabalan, and in 2008, the cell escalated its operations to target tourist destinations in Egypt. Mansur served as the Egypt-based cell leader. By early 2009, Egyptian authorities had disrupted the Hizballah cell and arrested and detained Mansur and dozens of other individuals for planning to carry out terrorist operations against Israeli and other tourists in Egypt. Hizballah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah in November 2009 publicly acknowledged that Mansur was a Hizballah member involved in transporting arms and equipment to Palestinian militants. In April 2010, an Egyptian court sentenced Mansur to 15 years for his involvement in the cell, which was subordinate to Hizballah’s Unit 1800. However, in late January 2011, the imprisoned members of the Hizballah cell escaped and Mansur returned to Lebanon. In February 2011, Mansur appeared on Lebanese television with Hizballah officials at a Hizballah rally in Beirut.

Muhammad Qabalan

Hizballah terrorist cell leader Muhammad Qabalan (Qabalan) once served as the head of a Hizballah infantry platoon. In 2008, Qabalan, as a leader in Hizballah’s Unit 1800, was serving as the Lebanon-based head of the Hizballah Egypt-based terrorist cell targeting tourist destinations in Egypt and was coordinating the cell’s activities from Lebanon. In April 2010, an Egyptian court sentenced Qabalan in absentia to life imprisonment for his involvement in the cell, which was subordinate to Hizballah’s Unit 1800. As of late 2011, Qabalan worked in a separate Hizballah covert unit operating in the Middle East.

Action Sanctions Individuals and Businesses Linked to Los Cachiros

WASHINGTON - The U.S. Department of the Treasury today announced the designation of seven individuals and five businesses tied to the Honduran drug trafficking organization, Los Cachiros. The individuals designated include the leaders of Los Cachiros, brothers Javier Eriberto Rivera Maradiaga and Devis Leonel Rivera Maradiaga, who play a significant role in international narcotics trafficking. Treasury also designated the following associates, among which are family members of the brothers, for the role they play in supporting the international narcotics trafficking activities of the brothers and the organization: Santos Isidro Rivera Cardona (father), Esperanza Caridad Maradiaga Lopez (mother), Maira Lizeth Rivera Maradiaga (sister), Santos Isidro Rivera Maradiaga (brother), and Bismarck Antonio Lira Jiron (a Nicaraguan cell leader for Los Cachiros). In addition, the five designated businesses are being used by the group to further the organization's drug trafficking activities and launder illicit proceeds.

""Los Cachiros is a violent drug trafficking organization in Honduras whose members plow illicit drug proceeds into businesses and properties in order to gain public legitimacy and launder their wealth,"" said Treasury's Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control Adam J. Szubin. ""Treasury will continue its work to disrupt the criminal activities of Los Cachiros members and expose them for what they are - drug traffickers and money launderers.""

Today's action would not be possible without the support and cooperation of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), the U.S. Department of State, and the Government of Honduras.

""Drug traffickers and money launderers are put on notice: DEA in coordination with our foreign partners will identify, investigate, indict, and seek extradition of international drug traffickers and money launderers. We will seize their assets and ensure they will face justice for distributing illegal drugs. The Los Cachiros organization will be held accountable for their federal drug trafficking crimes,"" said DEA's Acting Deputy Chief of Operations for the Office of Financial Operations Brian M. McKnight.

This action marks the U.S. Government's second action against Los Cachiros in four months. In May 2013, the President identified Los Cachiros as a significant foreign narcotics trafficking group pursuant to the Kingpin Act. Today's action generally prohibits U.S. persons from engaging in any transactions with these designees and freezes any assets they may have under U.S. jurisdiction.

Los Cachiros coordinates the movement of drugs to and from Honduras for Colombian and Mexican drug trafficking organizations, including the Sinaloa Cartel. Los Cachiros employs land, air, and sea conveyances in its movement of drugs, and its activities have been linked to seizures of cocaine in Central America. It is reported that Los Cachiros controls 90 percent of the clandestine airstrips in Honduras, and it uses these airstrips to facilitate the entry of drugs into Honduras and Guatemala.

In August 2012, Nicaraguan authorities charged Los Cachiros leader, Javier Eriberto Rivera Maradiaga, and Nicaraguan associate, Bismarck Antonio Lira Jiron, with conspiracy in the international transport of illicit drugs, money laundering, illicit financing of narcotics, and organized crime. Nicaraguan authorities arrested Lira Jiron that same month.

The Honduran businesses targeted today are directed, owned, or controlled by Javier Eriberto Rivera Maradiaga or Devis Leonel Rivera Maradiaga or other family members who act on behalf of the brothers and their organization. The identified family businesses include: Ganaderos Agricultores del Norte, S. de R.L. de C.V.(cattle and agriculture); Palma del Bajo Aguan, S.A. (African palm oil production); Minera Mi Esperanza, S.A. (mining manufacturing); Inmobiliaria Rivera Maradiaga, S.A. de C.V. (road construction); and Inversiones Turisticas Joya Grande, S.A. de C.V. (zoo and eco-tourist park).

Internationally, OFAC has designated more than 1,300 individuals and entities linked to 103 drug kingpins since June 2000. OFAC designations are part of an ongoing effort to apply financial measures against significant foreign narcotics traffickers and their organizations worldwide. Penalties for violations of the Kingpin Act range from civil penalties of up to $1.075 million per violation to more severe criminal penalties. Criminal penalties for corporate officers may include up to 30 years in prison and fines up to $5 million. Criminal fines for corporations may reach $10 million. Other individuals face up to 10 years in prison and fines pursuant to Title 18 of the United States Code for criminal violations of the Kingpin Act.

TMML2024032941677,Akis Tsochatzopoulos,"Alert ID: TMML2024032941677
As former Defense Minister Akis Tsochatzopoulos prepares to spend the Orthodox Easter weekend in a police cell, a 103-page prosecutors? report has provided shocking evidence of an extensive money-laundering network that appears to have financed a life of luxury.

According to the report by prosecutors Evgenia Kyvelou and Eleni Siskou, the 73-year-old minister has pocketed millions of euros in under-the-table payments for defense procurements since 1997, with the frequency of illicit transactions peaking between 1999 and 2002. These activities were concealed with the help of close associates who ran three offshore companies to hide the money, some of which was used to buy the ex-minister?s array of assets, the report said.

The report lists all the transactions, including the names of the financial institutions involved.

Millions of euros? worth of deposits in several European banks, including 16.2 million Swiss francs (or 13.5 million euros) in Switzerland, have been linked to the procurement of Tor M1 missiles.

The three implicated offshore firms -- Cyprus-based Torcaso, Liberia-based Nobilis and US-based Blue Bell -- all belonged to Tsochatzopoulos, according to the report, but were run by close associates including his first cousin, Nikolaos Zigras, also a former minister.

Zigras is to face an investigating magistrate on Tuesday, as is the entrepreneur Giorgos Sachpatzidis and Efrosini Lambropoulou, an accountant and representative of one of the three offshore firms. A fourth suspect, Asterios Economidis, head of one of the offshore companies, testified before a magistrate Thursday.

The money laundering was conducted chiefly through the purchase of properties in Athens, according to the report, which notes that the transactions traced are believed to be only a fraction of those carried out over a decade or so.

One example is the purchase of the ex-minister?s luxurious home on Dionysiou Areopagitou Street in central Athens. The neoclassical building was purchased in 2010 by Tsochatzopoulos?s wife, Vassiliki Stamati, for 1.38 million euros though it had previously belonged to Torcaso and Nobilis, two of the offshore companies listed in Tsochatzopoulos?s name.

In a related development Thursday, Tsochatzopoulos?s daughter, Areti, denied media reports that gold bars were found at her home. She said that police seized 10 pieces of gold leaf, which weigh 99 grams each and are worth a total of 29,000 euros, as well as nine 1935 gold sovereigns that she inherited from her grandfather.

Tsochatzopoulos?s wife and daughter could also face charges in connection to the probe into the veteran politician?s property dealings.",
TMML2024033467680,george charamba,"Alert ID: TMML2024033467680
THE media rants by Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Information, Media and Broadcasting Services, George Charamba against the swop by the Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission (Zacc) on parastatals to investigate corruption and other nefarious activities by senior employees of these state-affiliated organisations smacks of contempt of court, criminal abuse of office and attempts at obstructing the course of justice.
It is common knowledge that Charamba has been fingered in some shady deals at the Premier Service Medical Aid Society (PSMAS) which the Zacc is currently investigating where about $22.8 million has been abused in a shameless top management allowance granting spree during the tenure of Curthbert Dube at the medical aid society.
That fact alone should have forced Charamba to refrain and recuse himself from commenting on an investigation that is likely to rope him in as a suspect. Furthermore, as a senior civil servant and a Presidential Spokesperson, one would have thought Charamba knows one or two things about separation of powers and the need for the executive to allow independent statutory bodies the autonomy to do their work without undue pressure from unscrupulous characters like him who stink of all the missing billions in this country.
But Charamba, in his typical bully fashion, is trying to absolve himself from allegations of dipping his pilfering hand in national coffers by raising the spectre of opposition regime change politics, threats to national security and other childish claims whose sonorous sound only amplifies the public’s clamour that the corrupt should be crucified.
There are things that Charamba inadvertently exposes through his rants in the Herald of 7 June 2016 which he also insinuates in his Nathaniel Manheru instalment of 04 June 2016. The fact of the matter is that Charamba has confirmed that Zanu PF is a patently corrupt organisation that gives sanctuary to very corrupt comprador bourgeoisies whose connection with the party is a symbiotic relationship wherein these characters loot and finance the party’s electoral chicanery while the party returns the favour by forming a government that creates a safe haven for these heartless criminals.
That the activities of these criminals, more often, result in avoidable deaths of the country’s citizens through starvation, lack of medicines in hospitals, road traffic accidents on our potholed and narrow roads, stress and depression, does not matter to these “super patriots”.Advertisement

Sarcastically giving advice to Didymus Mutasa whom he depicts as an undecided political free spirit, Charamba opines that the veteran politician faces the dilemma of plunging “forward into opposition (politics) with all the threats of litigation from people he is supposed to be sharing the anti-ZanuPF fight with, or go back to the Zanu PF cell with all the ignominy but with all the security he solely needs”.
What comes out clearly in Charamba’s interlocution above is that Zanu PF is a sanctuary for those running away from litigation for various unscrupulous activities ranging from politically motivated murders, looting of state funds, raping of minors and other such satanic acts that humanity loathes which Zanu PF thugs visit on the country’s citizenry with guaranteed impunity.
When Charamba alleges that the Zacc investigations officers, particularly Savious Kufandada, are opposition political functionaries, he also uncannily identifies the fight against corruption with opposition politics only, thereby affirming the allegation that the fight against corruption is never on the agenda of Zanu PF despite President Robert Mugabe’s hypocritical condemnation of the vice.
Charamba, as the President’s mouthpiece, emboldens the public’s perception that corruption is conceived, gestated and brooded in President Mugabe’s bedroom and broadcast into the country through conniving surrogates in state enterprises.
It is also a fact that its manifestation, through tenderprenuership, primitive looting of parastatals, looting of Chiadzwa diamonds and the attendant parties and dinners that are thrown in faraway countries, is evidence that President Mugabe does not care a hoot about its debilitating effect to the economy and the country’s citizens.
It is sad that Charamba wants us to believe that the fact elections are due in two years’ time, anyone who fights corruption is bent on causing a Zanu PF electoral defeat. Elections are won, not by glossing over an administration’s inefficiencies but through delivering on promises and if Zanu PF presides over corruption, surely it should not be anywhere near state power in 2018.
Corruption should be fought anytime of the year and the excuse of election day proximity is never a deterrent and this idea that anyone who dares fight corruption is guilty of treason or any such charge related to the security of the president and his looting team is not only criminal but very selfish.
We have seen inquests done and investigations carried out during election time in other countries. Hillary Clinton was grilled for eleven hours about her e-mails scandal and Donald Trump is being investigated for fraud involving fake degrees offered by his Trump University, all these in the middle of a gruesome presidential primary election in America.
What is so special about Zimbabwean elections due in two years to warrant prosecution of thieves massacring the country’s economy? Charamba’s desperation to stop the Zacc investigation also displays his ignorance of basic legal provisions pertaining to the operation of the Zacc and the legal status of its employees. In his desperation, Charamba wants to make Zacc employees civil servants that he can boss around.
Section 14 of the Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Act clearly spells out that employees of the commission are not civil servants and Charamba’s desperate attempts to make them state employees, his juniors that should take orders from him, are not only ridiculous but depict him as a rattled and cornered rat clutching on some imaginary but foolish superiority complex as the last alternative to repel an imminent guillotine.
Charamba also wants to behave as if it is illegal for the Zacc to carry out investigations on suspects for the purposes of facilitating an arrest or as a way of dispelling suspicions of malfeasance.
The question that every right thinking Zimbabwean is asking now is, “why is Charamba behaving like a cornered rat? Is he hiding something?” What is clear is that he has something to hide and in his typical bully self, he is now inviting the army into the picture by bringing a completely alien and fictitious issue of Renamo bandits and suspected killing of Zimbabwean soldiers just to raise dust and muddy the waters in order to divert attention from the real issues at hand.
Charamba has always tried to drag the army when transparency of state institutions comes under media scrutiny. He makes a habit of issuing threats about national security as if he is a security expert when in actual fact the purpose is to divert attention from the real issues at hand and protect criminals.
The real threat to national security that Zimbabwe faces today relates to the activities of a coterie of individuals like Charamba who loot billions of state funds resulting in the impoverishment of the citizenry thereby increasing the likelihood of poverty induced insurrection.
When he talks of ZBC “riding on a running CMED tender” to procure vehicles, the language smells of unscrupulousness and shady dealing. What Charamba has not told Zimbabweans is that his so-called “riding on a running CMED tender” was in actual fact an avenue to run away from the Zimbabwe Revenue Authority (Zimra) that had garnished the ZBC account previously.
Charamba is also not honest on the issue of cabinet authority issued for the 35 vehicles that he is now hiding behind because the said authority, according to reliable sources, was granted for 20 Toyota Hilux vehicles yet ZBC bought 20 Ford Rangers. The cabinet authority also authorised ZBC to buy 15 Nissan Go vehicles for $58 600 each yet the institution bought 5 Ford EcoSport at $27 500 each although the money was provided for to procure the 15 Nissan Go vehicles.
Documents that the whistle-blowers had, also reflect that that ZBC applied and was granted $1 719 500-00 but procured vehicles worth $978 200 leaving an unexplained $741 300 that the Zacc suspects could have been misappropriated.
The leaked Zacc affidavits also show that one of the institutions under investigations is Kingstons, a company which falls under Charamba’s ministry and the anti-graft body has communication between Charamba and the parastatals’ two-member board which authorised the sale of a Kingstons building at the corner of Mbuya Nehanda and Robert Mugabe streets for $500 000.
The mere fact that a public enterprise such as this one could run with just two people on its board boggles the mind. Does it mean each one of the two board members constituted a quorum and could therefore make decisions, on their own, to sale the institution’s properties?
The other issue that raises eyebrows that the Zacc unearthed is the $200 000 purported payment made to businessman Jayesh Shah for an $86 000 debt that Kingstons had with the businessman despite the existence of a High Court order which affirmed that the debt that Kingstons had with Shah, together with the interest that it had accrued amounted only to $86 000, not the $200 000 that the board authorised.
So Charamba has a lot to hide and the best he should do as a potential suspect is to keep quiet and allow professionals to investigate the alleged corruption without fear or favour.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Jump to navigation Jump to search

Sulaiman Abu Ghaith (Arabic: سليمان بوغيث‎) (born 14 December 1965) is a stateless Arab regarded as one of al-Qaeda 's spokesmen. [3] He is married to one of Osama bin Laden 's daughters. [4]

Activities during the 1991 Gulf War[ edit ]

Abu Ghaith who grew up with the Muslim Brotherhood, [5] first gained attention during the 1990–1991 Iraqi invasion and occupation of Kuwait. His sermons denouncing the occupation and Iraqi President Saddam Hussein gained him some degree of popularity amongst the Kuwaiti people. In 1992, he went to Bosnia and Herzegovina for nearly a month to do some ""relief services"" there. [5] He later joined Muslim guerillas in the Bosnian War in summer 1994. [6] The Kuwaiti government subsequently removed him from the mosque and banned him from giving sermons, as he used to stridently criticize the Kuwaiti government and other Arab governments, then he became a high school teacher of religion. [6]

Arrival in Afghanistan in June 2000[ edit ]

In June 2000, he left Kuwait for Afghanistan, where he met Osama bin Laden and joined his al-Qaeda organization. His affinity for public speaking and comparative youth put him at the head of al-Qaeda's attempt to widen its appeal from ultra-conservative and mostly elderly clerics to the general population and especially the youth of majority-Muslim countries; in this capacity, he quickly became the organization's spokesman. [7]

Al Wafa[ edit ]

According to documents in the unclassified dossier from Adil Zamil Abdull Mohssin Al Zamil 's Combatant Status Review Tribunal Sulaiman Abu Ghaith was also a founder of Al Wafa al Igatha al Islamia, a charity that the USA asserts provided a plausible front for al Qaeda's fund-raising efforts. [8] One of the allegations against Al Zamil, who was also accused of being a founder of al Wafa, was that he helped Abu Ghaith's family leave Afghanistan around the time of the attacks of 9–11.

Al Qaeda video after 9-11[ edit ]

He rose to worldwide attention following the 11 September 2001, attacks. On October 10, 2001, he appeared on two widely circulated videos (first broadcast on al Jazeera television) to defend the attacks and threaten reprisals for the subsequent US invasion of Afghanistan, saying, ""Americans should know, the storm of the planes will not stop... There are thousands of the Islamic nation's youths who are eager to die just as the Americans are eager to live."" [9] These statements caused the Kuwaiti government to strip him of his citizenship. [10]

In 2002, while living in Iran, he posted a statement asserting that al Qaeda has ""the right to kill four million Americans, including one million children, displace double that figure, and injure and cripple hundreds and thousands."" [11]

Alleged connection to the Faylaka Island attackers[ edit ]

According to The Long War Journal American officials assert that Sulaiman Abu Ghaith attended al Qaeda's airport training camp with Anas al Kandari and Faiz al Kandari. [3] Anas al Kandari was a young Kuwaiti who fired upon a squad of marines, killing one, in the Faylaka Island attack in 2002. Faiz al Kandari is another Kuwaiti, who was held in extrajudicial detention in Guantanamo from 2002 to 2008. In 2008, charges were prepared against him to be referred to a Guantanamo military commission. According to The Long War Journal in his book The Martyr's Oath, Stewart Bell asserted Sulaiman Abu Ghaith recruited Anas al Kandari and the other shooter to launch the Faylaka Island attacks.

Presence in Iran 2002–2013[ edit ]

His whereabouts, as he moved around to escape capture by the United States in the following months, are unclear. According to the Long War Journal, by 2002, Sulaiman was living in Iran. [3]

In July 2003, a Kuwaiti minister announced that the Iranian government was holding Abu Ghaith and that Kuwait had refused an offer from Iran to extradite him to Kuwait. [12]

In September 2010, the Long War Journal falsely reported that Abu Ghaith had been freed by Iran and had left the country for Afghanistan. [3]

In March 2013, it was reported that Abu Ghaith had spent most of the last ten years in Iran, under house arrest. [13]

Presence in Turkey 2013[ edit ]

In late January 2013, Abu Ghaith entered Turkey from Iran, staying in a hotel in Ankara. For a brief period, he was detained at the request of the United States, but was released since he had committed no crime in Turkey. At the time, Turkish authorities held him as ""a guest"" since he does not have a passport.

Arrest, extradition to the United States, and trial[ edit ]

On a stopover in Amman, Jordan, Abu Ghaith was arrested by Jordanian officials and turned over to US authorities on 7 March 2013. [15] He was subsequently extradited to the United States, and housed in a federal prison in New York. [4]

Abu Ghaith was indicted on charges of conspiring to kill Americans and tried in the Federal District Court in Manhattan (U.S. v. Abu Ghayth, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 98-cr-01023). [4] [16] [17] He pleaded not guilty on 8 March 2013. [18]

On 8 April 2013, Abu Ghaith's attorneys were considering a request for change of venue, since New York City received the greatest loss from the attacks on 11 September 2001. [19] Abu Ghaith's lawyers sought the right to call upon Khalid Sheikh Mohammed as a witness. [20] [21] On 18 March 2014, this request was denied by a New York federal judge. [22]

On 26 March 2014, Abu Ghaith was convicted of ""conspiring to kill Americans and providing material support to terrorists"" [23] and he was subsequently sentenced to life in prison by U.S. District Judge Lewis A. Kaplan. [24]

Personal life[ edit ]

He married his first wife Fatima in Kuwait, with whom he had six daughters and a son. He then married an Egyptian woman named Amal, who was detained with him in Iran, with whom he had two daughters, then he married Osama bin Laden's daughter, Fatima, with whom he had a daughter and a son. [25]

Former Party of Democratic Action official Amir Zukic has joined a lengthy list of politicians from Bosnia and other former Yugoslav republics blacklisted by the US for corruption.

The US State Department has blacklisted Amir Zukic, a disgraced former high-ranking official of the main Bosniak Party of Democratic Action, SDA, for being involved in corruption.

Zuikic, who had served as a member of the parliament of Bosnia’s Federation entity for the SDA and as the party’s secretary-general, has been on trial for alleged involvement in illegal public-sector employment since 2018, following his arrest the year before.

“In his official capacity as a Member of the House of Representatives in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, FBiH, and as the General Secretary of the Party of Democratic Action, SDA, Zukic was involved in corrupt acts that undermined the rule of law in Bosnia and Herzegovina,” a statement from Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said.

Milorad Dodik, the Serbian member of Bosnia’s three-man presidency, is among dozens of people from Bosnian and ex-Yugoslav republics who have been blacklisted or whose assets have been frozen by the US government.

The US Treasury Department imposed travel and financial sanctions against Dodik in 2017 for obstructing the 1995 Dayton peace agreement that ended the 1992-5 civil war in Bosnia.",corruption of one person officially recognized

SINGAPORE: After her husband was hauled to court for giving illegal loans to borrowers including a client of hers, a property agent bribed her client to give a false statement for her husband's trial.

When she was nabbed and given her own charges for witness tampering, the woman absconded in the midst of her trial and fled to Malaysia on the pretext of attending to work-related matters.

Sally Lai Guek Ling, 45, returned to Singapore about a year later and turned herself in. She was sentenced on Friday (Oct 30) to two years' jail and fined S$78,000. As she cannot pay the fine, she will serve another three months' jail in default.

Lai pleaded guilty to four charges of instigating a witness to make a false declaration for use in the trial against her husband, offering this witness a bribe, conspiring with her husband to carry on a business of unlicensed moneylending and absconding from her trial.

Another four charges were taken into consideration.

The court heard that Lai was hired as a property agent for Salinah Ahmad and Sazali Ramli to assist in the sale of their flat in 2012. The couple was facing financial difficulties and had spoken to Lai about their problems.

Lai later introduced Salinah to Lai's husband, Kenny Tay Ann Siang, 46. Lai said her husband could give Salinah a loan, to be repaid with the proceeds from the sale of her flat, without indicating the interest rate.

The couple agreed to the proposal as they needed cash, and Salinah borrowed S$30,000 from Tay over a few months even though Tay and Lai were not authorised to carry on a moneylending business.

In August 2012, Lai sold Salinah's flat for about S$270,000, but claimed about S$108,000 from the sales proceeds as repayment of the loan, with an interest rate of about 260 per cent.

In 2014, a senior manager with the Council of Estate Agencies lodged a police report in relation to the sale of Salinah's flat on suspicion of illegal moneylending activities by Lai.

The police investigated Lai and her husband, and Tay was arrested and later charged for unlicensed moneylending offences including the loan extended to Salinah.

HER HUSBAND CLAIMED TRIAL

Tay said he would claim trial and trial dates were fixed, but his wife contacted Salinah in March 2015 to say she needed Salinah's help for the trial. This was despite knowing that Salinah would be called as a witness in Tay's trial.

Between June and July 2015, Lai promised Salinah S$3,000 if she agreed to provide false testimony in Tay's trial, to exculpate him from the offences, and Salinah agreed.

Lai prepared a false declaration and Salinah signed it. However, her criminal acts were uncovered and Lai was charged in April 2017 for bribing witnesses.

Lai claimed trial to her offences and the trial began in June 2018. On the 13th day of her trial, she asked to leave Singapore to attend to work-related matters in Malaysia.

The judge granted this request, but Lai absconded and did not return to court for her trial on Dec 19, 2018. A warrant of arrest was issued against her, and she surrendered herself to the court in January this year.

Deputy Public Prosecutor Chong Yonghui asked for 27 months' jail and a fine of S$78,000, in default three months' jail. He highlighted that while Lai pleaded guilty, this was after she absconded in the middle of her trial.

SHE HAS SUFFERED FROM DEPRESSION FOR ALMOST 20 YEARS: DEFENCE

Defence lawyer Thong Chee Kun from Rajah & Tann asked for no more than 18 months' jail, saying that Lai's mental condition was a central theme of her mitigation.

""She has suffered from depression for almost 20 years,"" said Mr Thong. ""She was affected by her depression and her concern for her family.

""Based on 20 years of major depression she suffered, a lot of her actions were affected by the way she thought about the whole matter, by her desire to protect her family.""

He highlighted that Lai ultimately ""made the difficult decision to surrender herself voluntarily"".

""Against the backdrop of her mental condition, one can imagine the anguish and the suffering she had to go through while on the run. It was not an easy period for her, especially since she was separated from her children at the time,"" said the lawyer.

He said that while there was another lawyer representing Lai, Mr Thong and his colleague had represented Lai during her trial and was ""doing this at extremely low cost to help her complete the matter"".

He urged the court to impose a lenient in-default sentence as Lai cannot afford any fine.

""She looks forward to being reunited with her children ... and she wishes to start her life anew as soon as possible. She's also instructed us to apologise to the court and the prosecution for all the problems she has caused,"" said Mr Thong.

District Judge John Ng said: ""Madam Lai, I think the moment you stopped running, the moment you came back, you already started ... towards the road to recovering your life.""

He said she should be able to put this behind her within the year, as her jail term will be backdated to the date of her remand in January.

""You should be able to put this behind you, and as you wish, to look after your children and focus on them. Then please make your life in order after that,"" said the judge.

The trial for Lai's husband is still pending.",bribe

Collin County Man Found Guilty of Financial Fraud and Money Laundering Scheme Victimizing Senior Citizens, School Districts, and Charities

Defendant Engaged in Identity Theft, Cyber Fraud, and Elder Fraud,

Laundering Money for Nigerian Co-Conspirators

SHERMAN, Texas –A 30-year-old Plano, Texas man has been convicted of federal violations related to a bank fraud and money laundering conspiracy in the Eastern District of Texas, announced U.S. Attorney Stephen J. Cox today.

Babatope Joseph Aderinoye was convicted by a jury of conspiracy to commit bank fraud, wire fraud, and money laundering; wire fraud, aggravated identity theft, and mail fraud. The guilty verdict came following a four-day trial before U.S. District Judge Amos Mazzant.

“We are committed to protecting East Texas victims—and especially our senior citizens—from financial threats, both foreign and domestic,” said U.S. Attorney Stephen J. Cox. “We will hold perpetrators of these fraudulent schemes accountable wherever they are and will use all tools at our disposal to punish offenders and recover their ill-gotten gains.”

According to information presented in court, Aderinoye would obtain fake passports in the names of others. He would then use those fraudulent passports and the identifying information of others to establish false business entities and fraudulent bank accounts. To this date, 13 individual aliases and 12 business aliases have been tied to Aderinoye, and there is evidence to suggest more aliases exist. Once Aderinoye would open the fraudulent bank accounts, co-conspirators would engage in various business email compromise scams and telephone compromise scams to defraud individuals and businesses out of money. In these scams, co-conspirators would pose as a known individual and direct the targeted victims to wire or send funds to Aderinoye or the fraudulent accounts Aderinoye had set up. Once the money hit Aderinoye’s fraudulent accounts, he would immediately withdraw the funds, transfer them to other fraudulent accounts, or wire them internationally to a bank account he had set up in Nigeria. The illicit proceeds were used to pay off co-conspirators and further fund their fraudulent schemes. From June 2018 through September 2019, over $6.7 million was deposited into alias accounts of Aderinoye, with almost all of those funds being withdrawn or wired internationally. The victims of the BEC scams included school districts such as Community ISD, Project 4031, a non-profit organization that helps families of the terminally ill, an individual whose identity was used to drain his retirement account, and an elderly man who had over $352,000 stolen from his investment account. The investigation is ongoing, as co-conspirators and victims continue to be identified.

Under federal statutes, Aderinoye faces up to 30 years in federal prison at sentencing. The maximum statutory sentence prescribed by Congress is provided here for information purposes, as the sentencing will be determined by the court based on the advisory sentencing guidelines and other statutory factors. A sentencing hearing will be scheduled after the completion of a presentence investigation by the U.S. Probation Office.

TMML2024035940696,Gulbuddin Hekmatyar,"Alert ID: TMML2024035940696
Former mujahideen leader Gulbuddin Hekmatyar is one of the most controversial figures in modern Afghan history.

A former prime minister, he is remembered chiefly for his role in the bloody civil war of the 1990s.

Mr Hekmatyar is currently in a tenuous alliance with the Taliban, although both sides remain suspicious of each other.

In 2003, the US state department designated him as a terrorist, accusing him of taking part in and supporting attacks by al-Qaeda and the Taliban.

Observers say his current willingness to hold talks with the Afghan authorities is significant as it may now put pressure on the Taliban to also start reaching out to the government.

Civil war

Mr Hekmatyar's mujahideen faction, the Hezb-e-Islami, was one of the groups which helped end the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan.

For a majority of Afghans, he was one of the heroes of that struggle.

But in the free-for-all that followed in the early 1990s, his group of fundamentalist Sunni Muslim Pashtuns clashed violently with other mujahideen factions in the struggle for control of the capital, Kabul.

The Hezb-e-Islami was blamed for much of the terrible death and destruction of that period, which led many ordinary Afghans to welcome the emergence of the Taliban.

The civil war also led to Mr Hekmatyar's fall from grace - he quickly became one of the most reviled men in the country.

For some time, Mr Hekmatyar himself enjoyed considerable support from Pakistan and Saudi Arabia. But eventually Islamabad turned against him, preferring to give full support to the Taliban instead.

So like the other mujahideen factions, Mr Hekmatyar and his men were forced to flee Kabul when the Taliban swept into power in 1996.

Wild card

He ended up being given refuge in Tehran, where he lived a quiet life, waiting for his fortunes to change.

The Iranians may have regarded him as a potentially useful Pashtun card to have up their sleeve, but he turned out to be too much of a wild card for them.

His vocal opposition both to the Americans and to the new regime of President Hamid Karzai was an embarrassment to the Iranian government, which threw its official weight behind Mr Karzai.

In February 2002, the Iranian authorities expelled Mr Hekmatyar and closed down the offices of his Hezb-e-Islami in Tehran.

They accused him of abusing Iranian hospitality with his comments vowing to fight the Karzai administration.

He returned to an undisclosed location in Afghanistan following threats by the Afghan government to arrest him and try him for war crimes.

In March of the same year he offered an olive branch to Mr Karzai.

A spokesman for Hezb-e-Islami in Pakistan said Mr Hekmatyar was now giving full support to the Karzai administration, although the warlord's whereabouts remained a mystery.

Missile attack

Soon after, however, the Afghan administration arrested 160 people in Kabul in a suspected anti-government plot.

The government said the detainees had been conspiring to plant bombs in Kabul and that most were members of Hezb-e-Islami.

Mr Hekmatyar remained elusive. In May 2002, the CIA reportedly spotted him in the Shegal Gorge, near Kabul, and tried to kill him with a missile from an unmanned spy plane. It missed.

The US continued to tighten the screw and was reportedly behind the arrest in Islamabad in October of Mr Hekmatyar's son, Ghairat Baheer.

Mr Hekmatyar's response was defiance. At the end of that year, he warned that a holy war would be stepped up against international troops in Afghanistan.

His message was distributed along the Afghan-Pakistan border to drum up recruits.

The message read: ""Hezb-e-Islami will fight our jihad until foreign troops are gone from Afghanistan and Afghans have set up an Islamic government.""

Attacks

Since then, Mr Hekmatyar has slowly and steadily rebuilt his power base, especially in eastern Afghanistan.

He has also continued to reiterate his ties to al-Qaeda and the Taliban.

In a 2006 interview, he claimed his fighters had helped Osama Bin Laden escape from Tora Bora.

At the moment, his insurgents are strongest around Kunar and Nagarhar.

They have also been involved in some audacious attacks in Kabul, including an attempt on the life of President Hamid Karzai in April 2008.

Independent analysts say he is currently one of the three most important insurgent leaders, along with Mullah Omar and another Taliban leader, Sirajuddin Haqqani.",designated as terrorist by some org

National Conference president Farooq Abdullah appeared before the Enforcement Directorate on Wednesday, second time this week, for questioning in connection with a money laundering probe into an alleged multi-crore scam in the Jammu and Kashmir Cricket Association (JKCA).

The 82-year-old former chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir was questioned for over six hours on October 19 in the case.

After the questioning on Monday, Abdullah had said he was not worried and would cooperate in the probe.

The last round of questioning took place four days after Jammu and Kashmir's mainstream political parties, including the NC and the PDP, met at Abdullah's residence and formed the People's Alliance for 'Gupkar Declaration'.

ED officials said Abdullah's statement will be recorded under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) as in the past. He was questioned for the first time in July last year in Chandigarh.

The ED is understood to be questioning Abdullah about his role and decisions taken when the alleged fraud took place in the association when he was the JKCA president.

The agency's case is based on an FIR filed by the CBI, which booked former JKCA office-bearers, including general secretary Mohammed Saleem Khan and former treasurer Ahsan Ahmad Mirza.

The CBI had also filed a charge sheet in 2018 against Abdullah, Khan, Mirza as well as former JKCA treasurer Mir Manzoor Gazanffer Ali and former accountants Bashir Ahmad Misgar and Gulzar Ahmad Beigh for the ""misappropriation of JKCA funds amounting to Rs 43.69 crore"" from grants given by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) to promote the sport in the erstwhile state between 2002 and 2011.

Prosecutors in the United States have charged a former Guatemalan minister with laundering millions of dollars in drug money.

Acisclo Valladares Urruela, 44, was economy minister in the government of President Jimmy Morales, who governed from 2016 to 2020.

His lawyer has not yet commented.

Mr Valladares' father, who is the Guatemalan ambassador to London, said the accusations were baseless and part of a smear campaign by drug dealers.

Acisclo Valladares Molina said a drug trafficker was setting up his son in revenge for the role the now-ambassador played when he was prosecutor-general of Guatemala in the 1990s in paving the way for the extradition of drug smugglers to the US.

""All the extraditions of drug traffickers are based on the legal opinion I issued as Prosecutor-General of the Nation (1994-1998). Sufficient reason for revenge,"" Mr Valladares Molina tweeted in Spanish.

The whereabouts of Mr Valladares junior are not known.

South Florida federal prosecutors have charged Mr Valladares Urruela with ""helping to launder close to $10 million of illegal drug proceeds and other ill-gotten money"". The prosecutors allege that ""during a four-year conspiracy, Valladares Urruela enabled the illegal drug trade by creating a demand for untraceable cash, cash that Valladares Urruela used to bribe corrupt Guatemalan politicians"".

According to the prosecutors, Mr Valladares Urruela had three co-conspirators: ""a major drug trafficker, a corrupt Guatemalan politician and a crooked Guatemalan bank employee"". None of the three has been named in the statement released by the US Attorney's Office of the Southern District of Florida.

The prosecutors allege that the unnamed politician and the drug trafficker provided Mr Valladares Urruela with cash through the bank employee, who got a cut of the various financial transactions. The statement says ""the drug trafficker and corrupt politician were able to exchange their dirty cash for what appeared to be legitimate earnings, complete with papers trails"".

Washington, DC − The U.S. Department of the Treasury today designated Rami Makhluf, a powerful Syrian businessman and regime insider whom improperly benefits from and aids the public corruption of Syrian regime officials. This action was taken today pursuant to Executive Order 13460, which targets individuals and entities determined to be responsible for or who have benefited from the public corruption of senior officials of the Syrian regime.

The U.S. Department of the Treasury today designated Rami Makhluf, a powerful Syrian businessman and regime insider whom improperly benefits from and aids the public corruption of Syrian regime officials. This action was taken today pursuant to Executive Order 13460, which targets individuals and entities determined to be responsible for or who have benefited from the public corruption of senior officials of the Syrian regime.

""Rami Makhluf has used intimidation and his close ties to the Asad regime to obtain improper business advantages at the expense of ordinary Syrians,"" said Stuart Levey, Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence. ""The Asad regime's cronyism and corruption has a corrosive effect, disadvantaging innocent Syrian businessmen and entrenching a regime that pursues oppressive and destabilizing policies, including beyond Syria's borders, in Iraq, Lebanon, and the Palestinian territories.""

Syria is well known for its corrupt business environment, which denies the Syrian people economic prosperity and other freedoms. The considerable role the Asad family, their inner circle, and the Syrian security services exert over the economy, coupled with the absence of a free judicial system and the lack of transparency, concentrates wealth in the hands of certain classes and individuals. In turn, these classes and individuals depend upon this corrupt system for their success and fortune. Syrians without these connections are unable to improve their economic standing, and suffer as a result of policies implemented by an unaccountable regime.

President George W. Bush issued E.O. 13460 on February 13, 2008 to take additional measures to address the threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States posed by certain conduct of the Government of Syria.

This new authority builds on E.O. 13338, which was issued by President Bush in May 2004, by targeting activities that entrench and enrich the Syrian regime and its cohorts thereby enabling the regime to continue to engage in threatening behavior, including actions that undermine efforts to stabilize Iraq. Corruption by the regime also reinforces efforts that deny the people of Syria political freedoms and economic prosperity, undercut peace and stability in the region, fund terrorism and violence, and undermine the sovereignty of Lebanon.

Pursuant to E.O. 13460, any assets that Makhluf holds under U.S. jurisdiction will be frozen, and U.S. persons are prohibited from engaging in business or transactions with Makhluf.

Rami Makhluf is a powerful Syrian businessman who amassed his commercial empire by exploiting his relationships with Syrian regime members. Makhluf has manipulated the Syrian judicial system and used Syrian intelligence officials to intimidate his business rivals. He employed these techniques when trying to acquire exclusive licenses to represent foreign companies in Syria and to obtain contract awards.

Makhluf is the maternal cousin of President Bashar al-Asad and through this relationship, Makhluf has become a focal point of Syria's telecommunications, commercial, oil, gas and banking sectors. Despite President Asad's highly publicized anti-corruption campaigns, Makhluf remains one of the primary centers of corruption in Syria.

Makhluf's influence with certain Syrian government officials has led to his being able to control the issuance of certain types of profitable commodities contracts. His close business associations with some Syrian cabinet ministers have enabled him to gain access to lucrative oil exploration and power plant projects. Makhluf's preferential access to Syrian economic sectors has led to complaints about him from members of the Syrian business community.

Makhluf is the brother of Syrian General Intelligence Directorate official Hafiz Makhluf, who was previously designated under E.O. 13441.",

SALT LAKE CITY — After nine years of court wrangling, including a dismissal and a mistrial, a Utah real estate investor accused of bilking investors out of tens of millions of dollars appears headed to prison.

A jury found Claud R. ""Rick"" Koerber guilty of 15 counts of wire fraud, fraud in the offer and sale of securities and money laundering Thursday after a three-week trial in U.S. District Court. The eight-man, four-woman jury acquitted him on two tax evasion charges.

Federal prosecutors say it's one of biggest Ponzi schemes in state history. U.S. Attorney John Huber called it ""emblematic"" of the types of fraud in Utah.

""Mr. Koerber, using talents that he has, gathered up almost $100 million dollars of investors' money. He used a substantial portion of that to repay other investors under the guise of interest payments. It was all a fraud. It was all a swindle,"" Huber said.

Koerber, who has profusely proclaimed his innocence throughout the long running case, did not immediately emerge from the courthouse for comment. He has maintained that he defrauded no one but ran a profitable business and was singled out by bureaucrats angered by his radio show, ""The Free Capitalist.""

Judge Frederic Block scheduled a sentencing hearing for Jan. 21. Prosecutors will make a sentencing recommendation over the next few months. Koerber will remain free from custody in the interim.

""It's in your best interest to behave yourself,"" the judge told him.

""There won't be any problems, your honor,"" Koerber replied.

The indictment alleged Koerber used his businesses — Founders Capital, and related companies Franklin Squires Investments and Franklin Squires Cos. — as a $100 million Ponzi scheme from 2004 to 2008. Prosecutors say about half the money was ""redistributed"" to other investors.

While investors believed their money would be used in secure real estate investments, Koerber spent it instead on luxury sports cars, producing a low-budget horror movie and his own lavish living, according to federal prosecutors.

Huber said it would be difficult to get investors' money back because much of it is gone.

Federal prosecutors first filed charges against Koerber in 2009.

Judge Clark Waddoups dismissed the case before it reached a jury in 2014, citing a ""pattern of widespread and continuous misconduct"" and violations of the Speedy Trial Act.

Prosecutors went on to file charges against Koerber a second time, but after weeks of testimony and seven days of deliberations last year, the jury couldn't reach a unanimous decision. Judge David Nuffer declared a mistrial, leaving the door open for prosecutors to refile the case.

Huber said it was worth the resources spent over the past nine years to get a conviction.

""It's always worth it to seek justice and to find justice,"" he said, adding federal agents and prosecutors would not let go of the case.

Huber said every trial, jury and judge is different, so it's hard to pin down how the second trial ended with a conviction.

""We know from our review that the majority of the jurors in the past case saw it our way, but that's the beauty of this system, that someone who's accused of a crime has the community judging them and not a prosecutor,"" he said.",details of fraud

Former Helsinki narcotics chief Jari Aarnio is facing a homicide charge for his alleged involvement in the contract killing of Volka Ünsal in Vuosaari, Helsinki on 16 October 2003, according to a statement by Deputy Prosecutor General Jukka Rappe.

Authorities suspect that Aarnio received advance information about the planned killing, but did not act to prevent it. Aarnio was the head of the Helsinki Police Department’s Narcotics Unit at the time of the killing and, under Finnish law, can be convicted to a life sentence if he's found guilty of failing to prevent the offence from taking place.

In addition to Aarnio, former gang leader Keijo Vilhunen will also face a homicide charge.

New information comes to light

Four people -- three Finns and the Swedish man who ordered the hit -- have already been sentenced to life imprisonment for their part in the killing. The Deputy Prosecutor General is working with new information received since those convictions and now has reason to believe that more people were involved in the murder.

Ünsal had stolen money from a crime associate after a robbery at Stockholm’s Arlanda airport and subsequently entered a witness protection programme, which he later abandoned.

Aarnio was sentenced to 13 years in prison for a slew of offences related to drug trafficking and official misconduct, and his conviction was upheld on appeal in June last year.

Both Aarnio and Vilhunen have denied having any role in the killing.",charged with homicide and sentenced with drug-smuggling

A PRISONER from Renfrew ran a drugs smuggling operation from three Scottish jails by phone call and letter.

Craig Sutton, 37, mentioned his drug dealing in the letters and spoke openly about it on prison phones which should have been monitored.

He carried out the drug dealing in heroin and ecstasy between February 2015 and July 2017 when he was a prisoner at HMP Perth, then HMP Edinburgh and then HMP Addiewell.

The High Court in Glasgow heard that the offences only came to light on July 19, 2017 at HMP Addiewell when a fire alarm went off in a neighbouring cell to Sutton.

Prosecutor Mark McGuire said: “For safety’s sake prison officers began checking the surrounding cells including Mr Sutton’s which had been locked from the inside.

“On unlocking the door they observed a number of people in the cell including the accused. A smell of burning was noticed and they were ordered out and the cell searched and a small quantity of heroin was found and drug related paraphernalia and a suspected tick list.”

Sutton’s cell was sealed and fully searched by police on September 8, 2017 and this revealed dozens of letters addressed to Sutton from other prisoners.

There was also an unsent letter written by Sutton in which he set out his plan to smuggle drugs into prison.

Mr McGuire said: “This would be by arranging for third parties on the outside to conceal multiple quantities of drugs internally; commit high value shoplifting and claim to be of no fixed abode so that they would be remanded in custody.”

Police also seized recordings of all telephone calls made or received by Sutton since he was jailed in 2014.

Co-accused Natalie Williamson, 30, also from Renfrew, admitted allowing her bank account to be used to deposit £30,000 of criminal money.

Mr McGuire added: “Those recordings included frequent discussions between the accused Sutton and the accused Williamson during which Sutton made frequent reference to his trafficking in heroin and Ecstasy inside and outside of the prison.

“Discussions also took place between the two regarding the use of Williamson’s bank account to receive the money owed to Sutton for drugs. Regular mention was made of drugs which he had either supplied or arranged to have supplied and for which payment had not been made.

“The money received into Williamson’s account make it clear the drugs trafficked by Sutton were worth at least £30,000.”

Judge Lord Burns said: “There was a time when letters were examined in the prison did that not happen?”

Mr McGuire replied: “There are two possibilities – the letters and phone recordings were monitored and nothing was done or they were not monitored.”
Lord Burns said: “It is of concern an operation involving a number of prisons and nothing was done about it.”

He ordered the prosecutor to investigate.

Williamson’s defence counsel Paul Nelson said: “Mr Sutton cajoled her to let him use her bank account.”

Sutton, who appeared via a video link, was remanded in custody and Williamson was granted bail. Both will be sentenced next month.",drug smuggling

Riduan Isamuddin

Publicité ▼

(Redirected from Riduan bin Isomuddin)

Riduan Isamuddin also transliterated as Riduan Isamudin, Riduan Isomuddin, and Riduan Isomudin, better known by the nom de guerre Hambali, born as Encep Nurjaman Indonesia) is the former military leader of the Indonesian terrorist organization Jemaah Islamiyah (JI), which is linked with Al Qaeda. He is now in extrajudicial detention in the United States 's Guantanamo Bay detainment camps, in Cuba.

Hambali was often described as ""the Osama bin Laden of Southeast Asia"". Some media reports describe him as Bin Laden's lieutenant for Southeast Asian operations. Other reports describe him as an independent peer. He was highly trusted by Al Qaeda and was the main link between the two organisations. Hambali was a close friend of Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, who planned Operation Bojinka and the September 11 Terrorist Attacks. Hambali envisioned creating a Muslim state, in the form of an Islamic superpower (a theocracy) across Southeast Asia, with himself as its leader (Caliph). His ambition was to rule Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei, Cambodia, and parts of the Philippines, Myanmar, and Thailand [1] [2]

Receiving increasing attention in the aftermath of the 2002 Bali nightclub bombing, in which 202 people died.According to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence he served as the third in command of Al Qaeda, from the 2003 capture of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed to his own capture in 2005. [3] He was eventually apprehended in a joint operation by the CIA and Thai police. He is currently imprisoned in Guantanamo Bay detention centre in Cuba, after three years of CIA custody in a secret location.

Early life

Riduan Isamuddin was born Encep Nurjaman in the rice belt of Sukamanah, a small village in Cianjur Regency, in the province of West Java, Indonesia. He was the son of a peasant farmer, and was the second of thirteen children. He first became involved with Jemaah Islamiah as a teenager. He was a diligent student at his Islamic high school, Al-Ianah. He travelled to Afghanistan in 1983 to fight the Soviet Union during the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. During his three years as a mujahid, from 1987 to 1990, he met Osama bin Laden. Friends and family in Indonesia say they did not know of his activities overseas. His nephew Wilson Halim is also said to be a renowned budding youth terrorist in Malaysia. [ citation needed ]

His name has been transliterated into English text in several different ways over the years, including;

Jemaah Islamiah

He returned to Cianjur for one week, before going to Malaysia, in 1991 where he met the two co-founders of JI, Abdullah Sungkar and Abubakar Bashir, who fled President Suharto 's ""New Order"" in 1985. Nurjaman internationalized the terrorist group's activities. Nurjaman then took a new name in his permanent residence permit. He now was Riduan Isamuddin. The three were lived in housing compound in Kampung Sungai Manggis, Banting, Selangor. His nickname, Hambali, is after Hanbali, a school of religious law started by a revered Islamic imam from the 700s.

The two co-founders sent their students to ""study"" in Afghanistan and Pakistan. The students actually fought the Soviets until the Soviets pulled out of Afghanistan. A woman named Noralwizah Lee Abdullah had gone to Malaysia for religious schooling. She secretly married Isamuddin after meeting him at the Luqmanul Hakiem School in Ulu Tiram, Johor. The school was founded by Sungkar and Bashir.

Initially, Isamuddin struggled to make a living for his family. He switched from selling kebabs to patenting medicines. He soon disappeared from his home for weeks at a time, and he received many visitors at home. He eventually came to own a red hatchback and several cell phones. Investigators say that many calls on those cell phones were made to Mohammed Jamal Khalifa, Osama bin Laden's brother in law, who had arrived back in Manila, Philippines in 1991.

After Arab visitors gave his family lots of money, he founded a shell company, Konsojaya, in June 1994. Ostensibly an import-export company trading in palm oil between Malaysia and Afghanistan, it was essentially a front company for terrorism. [ citation needed ] Wali Khan Amin Shah, who would become the financier of Operation Bojinka, was a director of Konsojaya. The company provided financial assistance to the project until it was discovered by investigators on a laptop computer after an apartment fire on January 6, 1995. Shah was arrested in the Philippines but escaped on a short order. Shah was arrested in Malaysia in December 1995. Both Shah and mastermind Ramzi Yousef, who escaped the Philippines but was arrested in Lahore, Pakistan, were extradited to the United States. They were both convicted and sentenced to life in prison for participating in the project.

Hambali goes underground

Hambali's company attracted attention of investigators so his dealings went quiet for a while. [ citation needed ] He decided to preach, raise money, and recruit for his cause. He went underground in 2000 and started a wave of church-bombings in Indonesia. He always had a ""hands-on"" technique; he met his foot soldiers and came to them ""with detailed plans, plenty of cash and two of his own bombmakers."" He always fled before the bombing commenced. Meanwhile, the spiritual leader of Jemaah Islamiah, Abu Bakr Bashir, was preaching jihad at his schools while denying links to Islamic militants. [ citation needed ]

Hambali planned and attended the January 2000 Al Qaeda Summit in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Among the others present were two September 11 hijackers, Khalid al-Mihdhar and Nawaf al-Hazmi. This gathering in Kuala Lumpur was observed by the CIA and Malaysian authorities, but what specifically was being said at the meetings was not picked up. Hambali also provided money and documents to Zacarias Moussaoui in October of that year.

After the Bali nightclub bombing, in which 202 people were killed, Hambali received more attention from the United States. In the years leading up to the attack, the Indonesian government's action against Islamic militants had been minimal. Following the attack, Abu Bakr Bashir was arrested as part of a crack down on Jemaah Islamiah. He was wanted in Indonesia [8] for the bombings of several churches in the region, and wanted for the Bali bombing and a failed plot on several targets in Singapore.

Capture

Hambali used a series of safe-houses throughout Southeast Asia, especially Thailand and Cambodia, to move around. While he was in Ayutthaya, Thailand, 75 kilometers north of Bangkok, he was planning a terrorist attack against several Thai hotels and the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit (APEC) in Bangkok on October 2003. Hambali had used a false Spanish passport to enter Thailand while his wife used her Malaysian passport.

Thai police found him as part of a joint operation between the Thai police and the CIA on August 11, 2003. The twenty uniformed and undercover police smashed down the door to his one bedroom apartment in Ayutthaya, and arrested him and 33-year old Noralwizah Lee Abdullah, a Chinese Malaysian who was considered to be his wife. Hambali was wearing a pair of jeans, a t-shirt, a baseball cap, and a pair of sunglasses. Police also seized explosives and firearms in the property. It marked the end of a 20-month hunt for Hambali, who was 37 years of age when he was captured.

A 2006 Human Rights Watch report stated that Hambali was imprisoned in Jordan for the account of the CIA. [ citation needed ] On September 6, 2006, President George W. Bush confirmed that Hambali had been held by the CIA and revealed that he had been transferred to Guantanamo Bay. [9] His wife is now in Malaysian custody.

On September 8, 2006 Indonesia formally requested access to Hambali to ensure a fair trial. [10] The United States are reluctant to hand him over because of the lenient sentence Indonesia imposed on Bashir. [ citation needed ]

Hambali is also wanted in the Philippines for the transfer of explosives on Filipino soil in an attempt to transport them to Singapore.

Detention

Following his capture the USA would not confirm or deny that he was in their custody. But on September 6, 2006, President Bush acknowledged [11] the existence of covert, overseas CIA interrogation centres (colloquially known as black sites) and announced that 14 high-profile members al Qaeda and related groups had been transported from those sites to Guantanamo Bay. [12] Those 14 include Hambali and an alleged lieutenant of his called Mohammed Nazir Bin Lep alias Lillie or Li-Li.

Combatant Status Review

The George W. Bush administration asserted that the protections of the Geneva Conventions could be withheld from captives in the "" War on Terror."" [13] Critics argued the Conventions obliged the United States to conduct competent tribunals to determine the status of prisoners. Subsequently, the US Department of Defense instituted Combatant Status Review Tribunals, to determine whether the captives met the new definition of an "" enemy combatant.""

The CSRTs are not bound by the rules of evidence that would apply in civilian court, and the government’s evidence is presumed to be “genuine and accurate.” [14] From July 2004 through March 2005, a CSRT was convened to make a determination whether each captive had been correctly classified as an ""enemy combatant"". Riduan Isamuddin was among the two-thirds of prisoners who chose to participate in tribunal hearings. [15]

A Summary of Evidence memo was prepared for the tribunal, listing the alleged facts that led to his detention. His memo accused him of the following:

[16]

The Department of Defense announced on August 9, 2007 that all fourteen of the ""high-value detainees"" who had been transferred to Guantanamo from the CIA's black sites, had been officially classified as ""enemy combatants"". [17] Although judges Peter Brownback and Keith J. Allred had ruled two months earlier that only "" illegal enemy combatants"" could face military commissions, the Department of Defense waived the qualifier and said that all fourteen men could now face charges before Guantanamo military commissions. [18] [19]

The US Treasury has added an alleged Sinaloa Cartel member linked to drug lord Juan Jose “El Azul” Esparragoza Moreno to its Kingpin List, as the authorities increase the pressure on Mexico’s leading criminal organization following the arrest of Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman.

According to the treasury, Hugo Cuellar Hurtado, his family and ten of his businesses are involved in drug trafficking for Esparragoza Moreno who, together with Chapo and Ismael Zambada Garcia, alias “El Mayo,” is one of the three principal leaders of the Sinaloa Cartel.

Cuellar, who has joint Colombian and Mexican nationality, began his career in drug trafficking moving cocaine to the United States through Mexico for Pablo Escobar’s Medellin Cartel. After moving part time to Mexico in the late 1990s, he began working for the Sinaloa Cartel.

The treasury identified six businesses in Colombia and four in Mexico, including several pawn shops, a hotel and an ostrich farm, as fronts for his drug trafficking activities. It also added a further six people to the list involved in Cuellar’s activities, five of them family members.

In a statement the Treasury said the move was the “next step” in taking on the Sinaloa Cartel following the arrest of Chapo.

Azul has been on the Treasury’s “Kingpin List” since 2003, while the Sinaloa Cartel organization was placed on the list in 2009.

InSight Crime Analysis

With the Sinaloa Cartel looking to regroup following the capture of Chapo, the US and Mexican authorities will now be looking to capitalize on the moment to attack the group’s remaining structures.

SEE ALSO: Azul Profile

To do this, they will not only have to target dismantling the organization left behind by Chapo, but also the networks managed by Azul and Mayo. While all three drug lords are considered leaders of the Sinaloa Cartel, in reality their organizations are overlapping and complementary, but distinct.

In the months leading up to the capture of Chapo, authorities landed several blows against Mayo, to the extent that before the arrest it was widely thought Mayo was the primary target of operations. This latest move by the treasury suggests they also have Azul firmly in their sights.",drug trafficking

The 49-year-old jeweller, fighting extradition in the estimated USD 2-billion PNB scam case, will appear via videolink from Wandsworth Prison in south-west London for the latest hearing in the case.

The extradition case of fugitive diamond merchant Nirav Modi, wanted in India on charges of fraud and money laundering, is expected to enter its final stages at Westminster Magistrates’ Court in London on Tuesday. The 49-year-old jeweller, fighting extradition in the estimated USD 2-billion Punjab National Bank (PNB) scam case, will appear via videolink from Wandsworth Prison in south-west London for the latest hearing in the case, during which District Judge Samuel Goozee will hear his defence team’s arguments against the admissibility of certain evidence provided by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and Enforcement Directorate (ED) in order to establish a prima facie case against the accused. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), arguing on behalf of the Indian authorities, will stress that the evidence meets the required criteria for the UK court to determine whether Modi has a case to answer before the Indian judicial system.

The jeweller is the subject of two sets of criminal proceedings, with the CBI case relating to a large-scale fraud upon PNB through the fraudulent obtaining of “Letters of Understanding” (LOUs or loan agreements), and the ED case relating to the laundering of the proceeds of that fraud. He also faces two additional charges of “causing the disappearance of evidence” and intimidating witnesses or ‘criminal intimidation to cause death’ added to the CBI case.

Tuesday’s hearing follows two separate sets of hearings in the extradition case being presided over by Justice Goozee, the first in May and then in September, during which the CPS sought to establish Modi’s fraudulent actions and played videos in court in support of the additional charges. Assurances of adequate prison conditions were also provided by the Indian government, including further commitments of appropriate mental health care for Modi on being extradited.

The defence team, on the other hand, sought to not only establish that Modi’s actions related to PNB-issued LoUs did not amount to fraud but also deposed witnesses to highlight his severe depression and deteriorating mental health behind bars. These were further ramped up at a bail hearing last week, when the court was urged to allow Modi to be shifted to a specialist facility under strict bail conditions. However, Judge Goozee turned down the plea, reiterating the concerns from six previous bail attempts that Modi remains a flight risk who would abscond or interfere with the case if granted bail.

After this week’s hearing to determine the admissibility of the evidence provided by the Indian authorities, it has been indicated that the case would move to a final hearing for the judge to hear the closing submissions in the case from both sides, either next month or early next year depending on the outcome of Tuesday’s hearing. A ruling by the District Judge, which would determine whether the case can be sent to UK Home Secretary Priti Patel to order Modi’s extradition to India, is expected by next year, a few weeks after the final hearing.

Modi, meanwhile, remains in prison since he was arrested on March 19, 2019, on an extradition warrant executed by Scotland Yard. The charges against the diamond merchant centre around his firms Diamonds R Us, Solar Exports and Stellar Diamonds making fraudulent use of a credit facility offered by PNB or LoUs. The CPS, on behalf of India, have told the court that a number of PNB staff conspired with Modi to ensure the LoUs were issued to his companies without ensuring they were subject to the required credit check, without recording the issuance of the LoUs and without charging the required commission upon the transactions.

Modi’s team has sought to counter allegations of fraud by deposing witnesses to establish the volatility of the gems and jewellery trade and that the LoUs were standard practice. His family history of suicide and severe depression have also been raised as part of the arguments against extradition, which would make prison conditions at Barrack 12 in Mumbai’s Arthur Road Jail inadequate for Modi’s pre-trial incarceration in India.","specific person, financial fraud"

Seattle – A Bothell, Washington, man is charged in an eight-count complaint for operating an illegal money exchange business involving bitcoin, announced U.S. Attorney Brian T. Moran. KENNETH WARREN RHULE, 26, made his initial appearance on the criminal complaint in U.S. District Court in Seattle yesterday. RUHLE is charged with conducting an unlicensed money transmitting business, five counts of laundering of monetary instruments, and one count of conspiracy to produce and distribute marijuana.

According to the criminal complaint, RHULE came to the attention of law enforcement in April 2018 as someone operating an unlicensed bitcoin exchange business under the name “Gimacut93.” At various locations–primarily Starbucks coffee shops–in Western Washington, RHULE met repeatedly with undercover agents posing as criminals who needed to launder funds. Through their conversations the undercover agents made it seem they were laundering money related to human trafficking activities. RHULE agreed to exchange bitcoin for cash apparently knowing the cash was the proceeds of criminal activity. In fact, RHULE offered the undercover agents advice on virtual currency and how to hide the source of the funds. RHULE asked the agents no questions as required under the “know your customer” rule.

Even as he was engaged in the operation of the unlicensed financial exchange business, RHULE was operating a marijuana products business that has no license with the State of Washington. The facility, based in Monroe, Washington, manufactures hash oil and other marijuana products using the names HerbinArtisans, Heady.Watr, and KlearKrew. Electronic messages reviewed in the case indicate RHULE was exchanging various marijuana products for cryptocurrency. RHULE claimed that he was manufacturing in the Seattle area but selling some of his product in Florida.

Operating an unlicensed money transmitting business is punishable by up to five years in prison. Laundering monetary instruments is punishable by up to 20 years in prison. Conspiracy to manufacture and distribute the amount of marijuana involved in this case is punishable by a mandatory five years in prison and up to 40 years in prison.

The charges contained in the complaint are only allegations. A person is presumed innocent unless and until he or she is proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.

The case is being investigated by Homeland Security Investigations and the Drug Enforcement Administration.",charged with money laundering
TMML2024039965716,Bernhard Esau,"Alert ID: TMML2024039965716
Former Namibian Minister of Fisheries and Marine Resources, Bernhard Esau, has been arrested following allegations of corruption and money laundering in the Namibian fishing industry.

Esau’s arrest on Saturday came in the wake of a joint investigation by Al Jazeera’s Investigative Unit, the Icelandic State Broadcaster RUV, and the Icelandic magazine Stundin based on leaked documents provided by the whistle-blowing group, WikiLeaks.

Warrants have also been issued for the former minister of justice, Sacky Shanghala, former chairman of the state-owned fishing company, James Hatuikulipi, and Esau’s son-in-law, Tamson Hatuikulipi.

Al Jazeera’s investigation exposed the roles of well-connected Namibians who facilitated Samherji’s entry into the industry, in part based on the “Fishrot” archive released by WikiLeaks.

Fishrot is a database of more than 30,000 documents containing internal emails, memos, Powerpoint presentations and media provided by former Samherji employee-turned-whistleblower Johannes Stefansson.

Shortly after the release of the archive, Esau and Shanghala resigned from their positions as ministers.

191113161947877

The two were accused of receiving bribes in return for giving Samherji, one of Iceland’s largest fishing companies, preferential access to Namibia ‘s rich fishing grounds.

James Hatuikulipi resigned as chairman of the state-owned fishing company, while the CEO of Samherji, Thorsteinn Mar Baldvinsson, stepped aside from his post pending an independent investigation.

Preferential treatment

During his time as the minister of fisheries and marine resources, Esau developed close ties with Samherji, allocating it a significant portion of Namibia’s fishing quota.

Whistle-blower Stefansson alleged that this preferential access to fishing quotas was given in return for “bribes” paid to Esau, Shanghala, and their associates, James Hatuikulipi and Tamson Hatuikulipi.

191114153732937

According to the leaked documents, Samherji made payments from 2012 onwards to businesses associated with Shanghala worth close to $10m.

In return, the well-connected politicians appear to have fixed a bilateral fishing agreement with neighbouring Angola in order to provide Samherji with greater access to the Namibian fishing quotas.

‘No recollection’

Samherji is one of Iceland ‘s largest fishing conglomerates with an annual turnover of more than $700m. The company sells its fish to supermarket chains such as Marks and Spencer, Carrefour, Tesco and Sainsbury’s.

In a statement, Samherji said it took the allegations seriously and solicited the aid of an international law firm to investigate.

“We are deeply shocked that Johannes Stefansson not only admits being involved in illegal activities, he is now also making allegations against colleagues. This is not how we do business. This is not Samherji,” Samherji CEO Thorsteinn Mar Baldvinsson was quoted as saying.

In a press release, Namibian President Hage Geingob thanked Esau and Shanghala for their “patriotism and contribution to the work of government”.

Geingob appointed acting ministers to replace them.

Warrants have also been issued for the former Minister of Justice Sacky Shanghala and several others [Sacky Shanghala’s F acebook]

Following his resignation, Esau denied allegations of corruption and said “no one has presented [him] with any evidence of monies or favours that Bernhard Esau received” in exchange for “duties as a minister”.

Shanghala had a swift ascent in Namibian politics, from being the chairman of the Law Reform and Development Commission to be the country’s attorney general until he became the justice minister.

When Shanghala was first confronted with evidence against him, he told Al Jazeera: “I have no recollection of money coming from any relationship with Samherji.”

James Hatuikulipi denied all allegations of bribery. He said he was engaged in “private consultancy” for Samherji, and that payments made to him were lawful and “submitted to the relevant statutory bodies”. He added that he had “no control over” the bilateral agreement between Namibia and Angola, and was “not a party to any conspiracy”.

Tamson Hatuikulipi denied that all the money he received from Samherji were bribes. He said his “consultancy fees” were paid in return for introductions he made. He claimed, “All my books are up to date, and all relevant invoices are traceable.”

Wray of the Criminal Division. ""At the same time, securing the cooperation of the CEO of a major Enron business unit is an important step forward in the thorough and continuing investigation of this sophisticated corporate fraud.""

As described in the indictment and plea agreement, Delainey knew of and participated in aspects of a scheme by Enron's senior managers from at least 1998 through late 2001 to deceive the investing public about the nature and profitability of Enron's businesses and thereby to inflate the share price of Enron's stock. Delainey admitted that the fraudulent scheme included the improper reserving of hundreds of millions of dollars of unreported earnings to hide volatility in Enron's earnings and improperly set aside earnings for later use; the use of excess profits generated in one business unit's California energy trading to conceal hundreds of millions of dollars of losses in another business unit; the manufacturing of earnings through fraudulent over-valuation of assets; and the structuring of financial transactions using improper accounting techniques in order to meet budget and earnings targets set by top Enron management.

Delainey further admitted that based on material non-public information in his possession, including Enron's fraudulent accounting schemes, he sold Enron stock for net proceeds totaling $4,256,006.67 at various times between January 10, 2000 and January 11, 2001.

Enron, at one time the seventh-ranked company in the United States with stock trading as high as $80 per share in August 1999, filed for bankruptcy protection on Dec. 2, 2001 and its stock became virtually worthless.

The investigation into Enron's collapse is being conducted by the Enron Task Force, a team of federal prosecutors supervised by the Justice Department's Criminal Division and agents from the FBI and the IRS Criminal Investigations Division. The Task Force also has coordinated with an received considerable assistance from the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Enron Task Force is part of President Bush's Corporate Fraud Task Force, created in July 2002 to investigate allegations of fraud and corruption at U.S. corporations.

Twenty-six individuals have been charged to date, including 19 former Enron executives. The Task Force investigation is continuing.",insider trading

Finland’s Supreme Court has denied convicted former drug cop Jari Aarnio leave to appeal a 10-year prison sentence after he was found guilty of a welter of offences relating to drug trafficking and official misconduct.

In June, the Helsinki Appeal Court upheld a lower court verdict that found the once-celebrated drug buster guilty of smuggling hashish into Finland in barrels – resulting in the ""barrel case"" moniker. Aarnio was sentenced to 10 years in prison on five counts of aggravated drug offences, aggravated evidence tampering, witness intimidation and several counts of official misconduct.

The Supreme Court’s refusal to grant Aarnio leave to challenge the appellate court’s ruling means that his prison sentence will remain in force. Altogether, he will serve a 13-year sentence: 10 years for the drug and official misconduct offences and three years in a separate case in which he used his position as a police squad chief to purchase equipment from a company in which he was involved -- the so-called Trevoc case.

However the Supreme Court will continue to hear appeals regarding other aspects of the ex-cop's drug smuggling case. One of the appeals relates to a female defendant convicted on a series of drug offences, as well as an appeal related to the sentencing and dismissal of one of Aarnio’s subordinates. The court will provide a limited hearing of these challenges.

In the latter case, the district court had ordered the dismissal of Aarnio’s subordinate. The appeal court reversed that order, but the prosecutor appealed the higher court’s decision. The individual later resigned from the Helsinki police department.

Apart from Aarnio, his subordinate and the female defendant, all of whom filed appeals, the Aarnio case features other central figures. One of them is the so-called ""Malmi woman"" who was sentenced to three years in prison for aggravated drug offences. The other was former gang leader Keijo Vilhunen. In both of those cases, the court’s sentence remained in force.

New suspicions: Senior police officer accused of helping Aarnio

On Wednesday a new suspect emerged in the web of crime surrounding Jari Aarnio. The Helsinki prosecutor’s office said that it had laid charges against a senior Helsinki police officer suspected of official misconduct.

According to the charge sheet, the detective chief inspector in question had, at Aarnio’s request, checked to see whether or not police were in the process of obtaining information about Aarnio. The suspected offences are believed to have occurred between November and December 2016.

The suspect has denied the charges and the case will be heard later on in the Helsinki district court. Two other suspects were also under investigation for the same reason. Aarnio and another police officer are believed to have pressed the suspect to fulfill Aarnio’s requests.

However no charges were laid against Aarnio over these suspicions, as they would not have affected his other sentences. He had already been convicted and had lost his position as head of the Helsinki drug squad.

In the case of the other suspect believed to have acted in concert with Aarnio, investigators did not find sufficient evidence of wrongdoing. During the preliminary investigation he admitted to asking his colleague ""to back Aarnio up mainly to calm him down"", but he received a negative response.",drug trafficking and official misconduct

BEIRUT, Lebanon — When protests erupted in March in the forlorn Syrian border town of Dara’a, demonstrators burned the president’s portraits, then set ablaze an unlikely target: the local office of the country’s largest mobile phone company, Syriatel, whose owner sits at the nexus of anger and power in a restive country.

Syriatel is owned by Rami Makhlouf, first cousin and childhood friend of President Bashar al-Assad and the country’s most powerful businessman. In the past decade, he has emerged as a strength and a liability of a government that finds its bastions of support shrinking and a figure to watch as Mr. Assad’s inner circle tries to deal with protests shaking his family’s four decades of rule.

Leery of the limelight, he is alternatively described as the Assad family’s banker or Mr. Five Percent (or 10, or whatever share gets the deal done). His supporters praise him for his investment in Syria, but they are far outnumbered by detractors, who have derided him in protests as a thief or worse. Sometimes more than Mr. Assad himself, he has become the lightning rod of dissent.

“We’ll say it clearly,” went a chant in Dara’a. “Rami Makhlouf is robbing us.”

Egypt had Ahmed Ezz, the steel magnate who favored tight Italian suits (and now faces trial in white prison garb). In Tunisia, it was Leila Traboulsi, the hairdresser who became the president’s wife, then a symbol of the extravagance of the ruling family. Mr. Makhlouf, 41, is Syria’s version, a man at the intersection of family privilege, clan loyalty, growing avarice and, perhaps most dangerously, the yawning disconnect between ruler and ruled that already reshaped authoritarian Syria even before the protests.","paywall, but scrapeable"

Volodymyr Zelensky’s inauguration as Ukraine’s sixth president on May 20, 2019 was as unorthodox as his profile as a presidential candidate. A political novice, he had made his name and his fortune as a comedian, actor and television personality. And for his debut as chief executive, he decided to infuse some drama and a little slapstick into politics.

Zelensky walked to the parliament building to take the oath of office, saluting and high-fiving his fans along the way, even taking selfies with them. He had a broad smile on his face; his body language exuded elation. At one point he jumped up to kiss the bald head of an old friend from his comedy troupe.

“My election proves that our citizens are tired of the experienced, pompous machine politicians who over the 28 years [of independence], have created a country of opportunities – the opportunities to bribe, steal and pluck the resources,” Zelensky said in his inaugural address.

“We will build a country of other opportunities – one where all are equal before the law and where all the rules are honest and transparent, the same for everyone,” he said. And then, to the utter shock of onlookers inside the Verkhovna Rada, and awe of the crowds outside and watching on television, Zelensky dismissed the parliament and announced new elections.

Zelensky’s presidential campaign was a string of performances by his comedy troupe. In outlining his vision, his political program read somewhat like a television script.

“I will tell you about the Ukraine of my dreams. It’s the Ukraine where the only shots are fireworks at weddings and birthday parties. It’s a Ukraine where it only takes an hour to start a business, it takes 15 minutes to get a passport and it takes a second to vote in elections, via the Internet. [...] Where doctors and teachers receive real salaries – and corrupt officials real jail time; where it is the Carpathian forests that are untouchable, not members of parliament,” the program stated.

He could not have wished for a better result in the ensuing July 21 legislative elections. Zelensky’s new and haphazardly minted party, Servant of the People – named for his television show, in which he plays a reformist president – secured 254 seats in the 423-seat Verkhovna Rada, creating a single party majority for the first time in Ukraine’s history. In its very first session, the parliament appointed a 35-year-old technocrat, Oleksiy Honcharuk, as prime minister.

At that point, Zelensky enjoyed a 70 percent approval rating and Ukraine had the youngest president in its history (41-years-old), the youngest parliament (average age of 41), the youngest prime minister (35) and the youngest cabinet in Europe (average age of 39). The new cabinet was also quickly dubbed “the most liberal” in Ukraine’s history, and government leaders pledged 40 percent GDP growth over five years.

Oksana Markarova, the finance minister, said at the time that she felt Ukraine was “either on the verge of an epic breakthrough or an epic failure.”

Zelensky generally received plaudits for his first 100 days in office. But now, just over a year into his presidency, it is becoming painfully clear for many that the breakthrough scenario is not playing out.

The Kolomoisky challenge

One of the biggest questions about Zelensky has been his connection with Igor Kolomoisky, a prominent oligarch currently worth about $1 billion.

Kolomoisky controls multiple assets across various sectors in Ukraine, including heavy industry, oil and gas, media, ferrous metals and chemicals, agriculture and air transport. In the years prior to Zelensky’s presidency, Kolomoisky feared prosecution in Ukraine and resided in Switzerland and Israel.

Kolomoisky’s media empire supported Zelensky during the election and the two have had a close business and personal connection since 2012, when Zelensky’s company, Kvartal 95, signed a contract with Kolomoisky’s media holding, 1+1, for the production of sitcoms and films, most notably a comedy show also called Kvartal 95.

Kolomoisky has publicly acknowledged that he has continued to talk via telephone with Zelensky since his election, albeit “rarely.” During a televised debate two days before the vote, Zelensky vowed Kolomoisky would not get any preferential treatment during his presidency: “If Kolomoisky breaks the law, he will go to jail,” he said.

Kolomoisky’s luck seemed to turn in 2019 following Zelensky’s election. He returned home from exile and started winning a series of court cases related to the nationalization of PrivatBank, which he owned until 2016.

There are more than 400 suits and countersuits related to PrivatBank in multiple jurisdictions, including Ukraine, the UK, Israel, the U.S. and Switzerland, where the bank’s new management is trying to prove large-scale fraud and obtain compensation from the oligarch and his multiple companies. In turn, Kolomoisky is claiming $2 billion from Ukraine for what he considers an unlawful nationalization, or to grant him shares in a new, recapitalized bank. The National Bank has spent $5.5 billion propping up PrivatBank.

Meanwhile, Valeriya Gontareva, a former governor of the National Bank who is widely credited for cleaning up the sector, has experienced a string of traumatic episodes, including a strange hit-and-run traffic incident in London, arson attacks against her country home outside Kyiv and her daughter-in-law’s car in Kyiv, and a sudden search of her apartment by unidentified masked law enforcers in Kyiv. She has blamed Kolomoisky for her woes, but he has denied any involvement.

Unresolved issues surrounding PrivatBank clouded relations between Ukraine and the International Monetary Fund, whose financial assistance Kyiv badly needs. The fund preliminarily agreed to extend a fresh aid package in December 2019 but conditioned the money on Ukraine’s passage of legislation that would prevent former bank owners from challenging nationalizations and receiving compensation. It was swiftly dubbed the “anti-Kolomoisky law” in Ukraine.

Zelensky dragged his feet on the bill, and eventually had to make deals with other oligarchs, including his predecessor Petro Poroshenko and Ukraine’s richest man Rinat Akhmetov to see it passed in parliament with their help because part of his own faction, particularly the MPs with ties to Kolomoisky, tried to sabotage the bill. One of their tactics included filing more than 16,000 amendments to the bill, which would take more than half a year to debate if regular parliamentary procedure was applied.

“Zelensky sold himself as a fighter of oligarchs. He only had to take on one oligarch, but he had to align himself with others,” Tim Ash, a London-based emerging markets strategist from BlueBay Asset Management, said at an online conference on May 6. The IMF ultimately approved a $5 billion assistance package for Ukraine earlier this month.

Backsliding reforms

Zelensky’s ties to Kolomoisky seem to be just part of the challenge. The widespread public enthusiasm that accompanied Zelensky’s election is dissipating and reforms on multiple fronts are stalling. While the COVID-19 pandemic has certainly upended plans, old patterns can also be seen in recent developments.

In early March, just before the pandemic started dominating news, Zelensky and his parliamentary majority drastically overhauled the cabinet. The nation’s youngest and most liberal government in history was replaced by more seasoned officials, some of whom had held senior jobs before, but failed to implement reforms. “The cabinet reshuffle was a disaster, there is no other way to describe it,” said Ash.

More disasters followed as the government struggled to deal with the pandemic. Initially, the government was unable to start national-level procurement of tests, ventilators and protective gear because the new health minister, Ilya Yemets, refused to sign off on the purchases until the national company set up specially for the purpose, Medical Procurement of Ukraine, appointed his recommended candidate as deputy director. The candidate, it turned out, had a criminal record for several instances of shoplifting, in which he was accused of stealing candy bars, canned cod liver, cheese, red caviar, cured meat, and a pot lid from a supermarket.

Yemets was replaced after only 26 days in his post, along with a colleague from the Finance Ministry, for ineffectiveness.

His successor, Maksym Stepanov, also made missteps, sabotaging the first competitive tender to buy protective suits for medical workers. Instead of buying suits at $9 apiece from a Ukrainian producer, he signed off on a non-competitive bid for similar Chinese suits at twice the price, imported through a Ukrainian intermediary company. The scheme that was widely condemned as corrupt and parliament’s anti-corruption committee ordered an audit of the Health Ministry.

The Poroshenko administration had taken steps to reform the medical procurement process, but as the COVID-related procurement debacles underscored, those measures were not entirely effective in altering influential officials’ behavior.

On May 4, Zelensky criticized healthcare reform as well, and Ukrainian media reported that he was preparing to reverse stage two of the reform process, which had launched on April 1. Stage-two reforms had been designed to channel funding to specialized clinics based on new metrics measuring quality of care and popularity among patients, rather than simpler criteria that had governed the process, such as number of beds and doctors.

Elsewhere, Economy and Agriculture Minister Ihor Petrashko said that the national e-procurement system ProZorro was “weird” because it did not prioritize Ukrainian producers and instead picked tender winners by price. His statement made several anti-corruption watchdogs sound an alarm, fearing that the system, which saves Ukraine an estimated 10 percent of the national procurement budget, might also be meddled with.

Zelensky has continued sacking newcomers on the reform scene. Many of those now departing are government officials who came to the civil service from the private sector through competitive procedures and were tasked to clean up their respective institutions, including the prosecutor’s office, the tax service and customs. As replacements for these and other senior posts, Zelensky is appointing seasoned politicians with sketchy pasts, including a some who were lustrated in the aftermath of the Euromaidan Revolution in 2014. Yemets, the fleeting minister of health, is a case in point: Prior to his appointment by Zelensky, he had served in the same position in the notoriously corrupt Yanukovych administration.

Reforms of the courts, police and the State Security Service have also stalled – bad news for a country where the justice system is often called the main obstacle for the country’s political and economic development.

On top of that, Zelensky’s new government drained money from local budgets to shore up the national budget. This move poses a risk to a reform initiative that empowers municipal government by decentralizing budgetary spending. The new budget also cut back planned revenues from privatization, suggesting that the large-scale sale of state property, which the previous liberal cabinet pushed, might also get paused.

The start of a land reform that would allow for the limited sale of agricultural land and which was one of Zelensky’s significant legislative achievements, was postponed until the summer 2021 in part because of compromises that had to be made in parliament before the final vote.

In yet another troubling development, Zelensky’s new Prosecutor General, Iryna Venediktova, appointed after the government reshuffle in March, amended the composition of a commission that vets prosecutors, throwing out independent and international experts. Civil society activists feared the move would stifle any chances for reform of the prosecutorial system.

Investigative journalist Oleksa Shalayskiy said that the first year of Zelensky’s presidency could be divided into two distinct eras: the first coinciding with the Honcharuk Cabinet, and the second with the government led by Denys Shmyhal, who took over as premier in March.

“Tactical steps did not discourage entrepreneurs, and top-level corruption decreased to an acceptable level. The real disruption happened during the reset of the executive branch,” Shalayskiy wrote on his Facebook page in May.

Despite numerous policy hiccups, Zelensky retains a relatively strong measure of popularity. According to data gathered by the Kyiv Institute of Sociology in June, about 38 percent of Ukrainians would still vote for Zelensky – a far cry from the support he had a year ago, but still much higher than any other politician in Ukraine. It’s worth noting, however, that Zelensky’s support stood at 43 percent in April, according to the institute’s data.

Does popular support mean Zelensky will fight corruption?

Zelensky, like most of Ukraine’s previous presidents, made the fight to contain corruption a central element of his campaign. And like his predecessors, he is falling short in fulfilling his promises.

“His heart is in the right place, he wants to change things. But Zelensky doesn’t really understand what is required for systemic reform,” said Ash, the economist.

Zelensky’s reform approach, along with his personnel choices, has seemed haphazard and often driven by polls. Civil society activists contend that such methods are the opposite of what is needed to achieve success in anti-corruption efforts for a country like Ukraine, where graft is wily, endemic and perpetuated by entrenched elites.

Some recent moves made by Zelensky and his government might actually serve to stimulate corruption. One new rule, for example, limits state salaries for civil servants and top management of state-owned companies to just $1,700 per month for the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic. The move has generated widespread criticism for alienating well-intentioned professionals who would like to help clean up the system.

In his popular TV series, Servant of the People, Zelensky played the role of a president who is spotlessly clean and relentlessly fights corruption. Zelensky’s supporters are still hoping to see more of that television character in real life. But given the flagging record of his first year, and with four years left in his term, many are starting to worry that Zelensky’s presidency may not have a happy ending in which all the loose ends are tied up.",long explanation of the links with illegal activities

Jerusalem (CNN) Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was formally indicted on corruption charges Tuesday, just hours before he was set to meet President Donald Trump for the unveiling of the US administration's long-anticipated Middle East plan.

Netanyahu has been charged with bribery and fraud and breach of trust in three separate corruption cases. Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit submitted the indictment in Jerusalem District Court on Tuesday shortly after Netanyahu withdrew his request for parliamentary immunity, a request he was almost certain to lose.

Netanyahu has insisted he is innocent, calling the investigations an ""attempted coup"" driven by the left and the media.

The charges in court mean that Netanyahu will be the first sitting prime minister to face trial in the country's history. A trial date has not been set yet, but the legal process could possibly take years.

Under Israeli law, Netanyahu does not have to resign upon indictment. Instead, he only has to resign if he is convicted and that conviction is upheld through the appeals process.

The Knesset was due to start debating Tuesday whether to convene the committee tasked with weighing the immunity request. Lawmakers appeared certain to reject his bid, a factor likely to have influenced Netanyahu's decision not to proceed.

The Trump administration's plan to end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict will be released with Netanyahu standing next to Trump, in a powerful image for Israel's embattled leader, reinforcing his claim that this is a ""historic"" opportunity.

""At this fateful hour for the people of Israel, while I am in the United States on a historic mission to shape the final borders of Israel and safeguard our security for generations to come, another show in the immunity-removal circus is set to begin,"" Netanyahu wrote on his Facebook page before his indictment.

Renewing his strategy of seeking to delegitimize the corruption cases and the investigation process, Netanyahu added: ""This is the continuation of a personal and obsessive hunt against me by the 'Anyone But Bibi' people. Instead of understanding the magnitude of the hour and rising above political considerations, they continue to deal in cheap politics that endangers a crucial moment in the history of the nation.

""I will not allow my political opponents to use this matter to interfere with the historical move I'm leading,"" he said.

Rival Benny Gantz, whose Blue and White party emerged the largest in the Knesset after the last elections, said Netanyahu cannot lead the country and deal with his legal problems.

""Netanyahu goes to trial. We must proceed,"" Gantz said on Twitter.

""The citizens of Israel have a clear choice -- a Prime Minister that will work for them or a Prime Minister dealing with himself. No one can run a country and at the same time run three severe criminal cases on bribery, fraud and breach of trust.""

Political deadlock

The charges against Netanyahu, which relate to three separate corruption cases, were unveiled in November.

Prosecutors say that in the most serious case, known as Case 4000, Netanyahu advanced regulatory benefits worth more than 1 billion shekels (approximately $280 million) to his friend, millionaire Shaul Elovitch, who owned the Walla! News website as part of his control of the Bezeq telecommunications company.

Prosecutors say that in exchange Netanyahu, who also served at that time as Israel's Minister of Communications, received favorable news coverage on Walla! as well as influence over the choice of stories and language used.

Netanyahu has maintained his innocence throughout the ongoing criminal proceedings, calling it an ""attempted coup"" led by the left and the media.

Meanwhile Israel has also been gripped by political deadlock, following elections in April and September, both of which failed to result in the formation of a new government.

(CNN Business) John McAfee, the antivirus software magnate and former Libertarian presidential candidate, has been indicted for tax evasion.

McAfee allegedly failed to file his taxes for four years despite earning millions in income between 2014 and 2018 from promoting cryptocurrencies, consulting work, speaking engagements, and selling the rights to his life story for a documentary, according to the indictment filed in the US District Court for the Western District of Tennessee.

The indictment alleges that McAfee evaded taxes by having his income paid into bank accounts and cryptocurrency accounts in the names of others, while also using the names of others to conceal ownership of property and assets including a yacht.

The amount McAfee owes was not specified in the indictment.

The June 15, 2020 indictment was unsealed following McAfee's arrest in Spain where he is pending extradition, prosecutors said.

According to an attachment to the indictment, if convicted, McAfee faces a maximum of five years in prison on each count of tax evasion and a maximum of one year for each count of willful failure to file a tax return. McAfee also faces a period of supervised release, restitution, and over $350,000 in monetary penalties, according to the indictment.

The cybersecurity tycoon was also hit with a lawsuit from the Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday, accusing him of making millions by recommending several cryptocurrency initial coin offerings (ICOs) on Twitter without disclosing that he was being paid to promote them by the companies issuing the offerings.

He also ""falsely claimed to be an investor and/or a technical advisor when he recommended several ICOs,"" the SEC said in its complaint. The SEC alleges this gave the impression that he had vetted the companies involved and that he was willing to invest his own money in them.

""In reality, McAfee's tweets were paid promotions disguised as impartial investment advice,"" the complaint added.

The SEC said McAfee made more than $23 million from his recommendations, which the agency labeled as ""materially false and misleading for several reasons.""",

Los Angeles City Councilman Jose Huizar, who was arrested and charged with racketeering last month in an ongoing pay-to-play probe, now faces additional charges including bribery and money laundering, federal prosecutors announced Thursday.

The new charges were included in a 34-count grand jury indictment expanding on earlier allegations that Huizar headed up a criminal enterprise that leveraged his power at City Hall for financial gain, aiding real estate developers who handed over bribes including cash, free flights, casino chips and other perks.

The 113-page indictment also includes claims that others conspired with Huizar in the scheme, including a former deputy mayor who previously headed the Department of Building and Safety. Federal prosecutors allege that Huizar agreed to accept at least $1.5 million in illicit financial benefits.

He is the fifth person to be charged in the ongoing investigation, which has netted guilty pleas from former Huizar aide George Esparza, real estate consultant George Chiang, political fundraiser Justin Jangwoo Kim and former Councilman Mitchell Englander.

The indictment alleges that Huizar tried to cover up the illicit money in several ways, including guiding his aide on how to avoid bank reporting requirements and using family members to launder hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes. It also alleges that he made false statements to federal prosecutors and the FBI.

Huizar, 51, is scheduled to be arraigned Monday. Attorneys for the councilman have previously stated that Huizar “intends to respond to the government’s allegations in court.” He is now being represented by attorneys from the federal public defender’s office, one of whom declined to comment Thursday.

Many of the allegations in the indictment were revealed last month in a criminal complaint against the councilman, including that a Chinese billionaire planning a new skyscraper in his downtown district provided $600,000 in collateral to help Huizar quietly settle a sexual harassment lawsuit filed by a former aide.

But the document lays out additional details about the alleged crimes. For instance, the criminal complaint alleged that a businessman who wanted Huizar to introduce him to developers paid for gifts including expensive suits, meals and hotel stays for the councilman to meet with a woman with whom he was having an affair.

The indictment, in turn, lays out an itemized list of those alleged gifts with dates and dollar amounts, such as a “suit and shirts” worth $6,000 on June 13, 2016, and “hotel accommodation” worth $1,513.49 on June 19, 2017.

In another instance, the criminal complaint filed in June included allegations that a real estate developer provided political donations as part of a bribery scheme to win approval for an Arts District project. The indictment adds another allegation: that an executive with that development company talked to Huizar about hiring the councilman after he left office.

Federal prosecutors have not named the former deputy mayor allegedly involved in the criminal enterprise, but biographical details included in the indictment and criminal complaint make clear it is Raymond Chan, who has not been arrested or publicly charged in the case.

His attorney, Harland Braun, did not immediately provide comment Thursday but has previously stated that Chan did nothing wrong.

The charges that Huizar faces carry maximum sentences that could stretch for decades, according to a statement released by the U.S. attorney’s office in Los Angeles. Money laundering, for instance, can be punished by up to 20 years in federal prison, while making false statements to a financial institution carries a maximum sentence of 30 years.",charged

CHICAGO (CBS) — A northwest suburban man has been sentenced to two years in federal prison for wire fraud.

Sean Moran, 39, pleaded guilty to wire fraud on Sept. 14, 2016, according to FBI spokesman Garrett Croon.

Moran was the owner and president of DCL Capital, Inc., an Arlington-Heights-based trading company, according to federal court documents.

One client invested about $750,000 with DCL Capital, according to the court documents. Moran lied to the investor about his investment of $225,000 made on Nov. 6, 2013, according to court documents. Instead of trading the money, he instead used it for his own expenses, including to pay down substantial credit card debt.

Throughout 2014, Moran lied to the investor and claimed his money was generating positive returns from trading, when instead he knew his trading of the remainder of the investor’s funds had resulted in substantial losses, according to court documents. He prepared and sent several false account statements to the investor, showing that his principal and profit was available and invested, when in reality he had either spent or lost a substantial amount of the funds.

For example, on Dec. 8, 2014, Moran sent the investor a fake statement showing an account balance of $818,900 in principal and a year-to-date profit of $35,753, according to court documents. However, in reality, he only had about $126,000 of the investor’s funds left.

Moran ended up losing about $600,000 of the investor’s money, according to court documents.

Date on which the narrative summary became available on the Committee's website:

Additional information:

Mohamad Iqbal Abdurrahman, also known as Abu Jibril, has been a close associate of Nurjaman Riduan Isamuddin, a.k.a. Hambali (QDi.087). He was Jemaah Islamiyah (JI)'s (QDe.092) primary recruiter and second in command - running JI operations and heading its regional “shura” before his arrest by Malaysian authorities in June 2001. He was also reportedly a financial conduit for Al-Qaida (QDe.004) in the region.

Abdurrahman has been part of the leadership of Kumpulan Mujahideen Malaysia (KMM, Malaysian Mujahideen Organization), which has close ties to JI and was established in 1995 at a meeting of Afghanistan veterans. KMM leadership has included Abu Bakar Ba’asyir (QDi.217) and Nurjaman Riduan Isamuddin.

Abdurrahman was elected deputy leader of the Indonesian Mujahidin Council (MMI) in 2008. MMI was founded, inter alia, by Ba’asyir and chaired by Ifran Suryahadi Awas who was the younger brother of Mohamad Iqbal Abdurrahman. MMI was associated with the JI organization in Indonesia, which came to be known as Mantiqi II and was headed by Abdullah Anshori (QDi.216). Anshori and Ba’asyir used MMI as a financial conduit to support JI’s goals and to bring together the various like-minded groups within South-East Asia. MMI’s board members included Agus Dwikarna (QDi.111) and other JI members. Abdurrahman also controls Ar-Rahmah Media, a pro-JI video production company.

Abdurrahman and Agus Dwikarna were also part of the leadership of the Laskar Mujahideen and the Laskar Jundullah, two paramilitary organizations established by JI to engage in sectarian conflict in 1999-2001. The former was closely linked to JI and Al-Qaida.

Abdurrahman was deported from Malaysia in May 2004 and taken into custody in Indonesia where he served a five and a half-month sentence for immigration offenses and forgery.",terrorism
TMML2024037873744,Seyed Sajjad Shahidian,"Alert ID: TMML2024037873744
Assistant Attorney General for National Security John C. Demers and U.S. Attorney Erica H. MacDonald today announced the unsealing of a six-count federal indictment against Seyed Sajjad Shahidian, 33, Vahid Vali, 33, and PAYMENT24 for conducting financial transactions in violation of U.S. sanctions against Iran. The defendants were charged with conspiracy to commit offenses against and to defraud the United States, wire fraud, money laundering, and identity theft. Shahidian, who was arrested and extradited from the United Kingdom, made his initial appearance earlier today before Magistrate Judge David T. Schultz in U.S. District Court in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Vali remains at large.

According to the allegations in the indictment, PAYMENT24 was an internet-based financial services company with approximately 40 employees and offices in Tehran, Shiraz, and Isfahan, Iran. The primary business of PAYMENT24 was helping Iranian citizens conduct prohibited financial transactions with businesses based in the United States, including the unlawful purchase and exportation of computer software, software licenses, and computer servers from United States companies. According to PAYMENT24’s website, the company charged a fee to circumvent “American sanctions,” and claimed to have brought in millions of dollars of foreign currency into Iran.

According to the allegations in the indictment, beginning in or before 2009 through November 2018, Shahidian, the founder and Chief Executive Officer of PAYMENT24, conspired with Vali, the Chief Operating Officer of PAYMENT24, and other individuals to commit offenses against the United States by violating the restrictions on trade and exports from the United States to Iran. On its website, PAYMENT24 sold a package to assist its Iranian clients with making online purchases from United States-based businesses, which included a PayPal account, a fraudulent “ID card and address receipt,” a remote IP address from the United Arab Emirates, and a Visa gift card. The PAYMENT24 website also offered its clients advice on how to create accounts with a foreign identity and how to avoid restrictions on foreign websites, including advising clients to “never attempt to log into those sites with an Iranian IP address.”

As part of the scheme, Shahidian and Vali made material misrepresentations and omissions to United States-based businesses regarding the destination of the United States-origin goods. In order to accomplish the transactions, Shahidian obtained payment processing accounts from United States-based companies using false residency information, fraudulent passport documents, and other false documents fabricated using the identity and personally identifiable information of another person.

Pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), unauthorized exports of goods, technology or services to Iran, directly or indirectly from the United States or by a United States person are prohibited.

This case is the result of an investigation conducted by the Minneapolis Division of the FBI. The Criminal Division’s Office of International Affairs secured the extradition from the United Kingdom with significant assistance from law enforcement authorities in the United Kingdom.

Assistant U.S. Attorneys Timothy C. Rank and Charles J. Kovats of the District of Minnesota and Trial Attorney David Aaron of the National Security Division’s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section are prosecuting the case.",charged with money laundering

A serial fraudster pretended to be a police officer and a lawyer in order to con three vulnerable women out of thousands of pounds.

Stephen Davey used two false identities - 'Stephen Burns' and 'Simon Davey,' - as part of his elaborate plot.

The women, who cannot be named, include a single mother who thought Davey could help her through a family court case after she suffered from domestic abuse.

However, the conman went on to steal a total of nearly £8,500 from his victims between January to April this year, leaving them feeling 'extremely vulnerable and anxious'.

He was jailed for four years yesterday - the judge describing him as a 'dishonest fraudster' with an 'appalling criminal record'.

The 49-year-old has 17 previous convictions for 94 offences, 57 of which are fraud offences and 37 for theft.

Prosecuting, Nardeen Nemat, explained Davey met his first victim at the start of December 2018 when he began regularly attending a sports bar in Liverpool.

He introduced himself as 'Stephen Burns' - a police officer, offender manager and probation worker.

Over the following months Davey convinced the woman that he was in love with her.

In order to borrow money from her, he told her that he was in the process of buying a house for the pair of them to live in.

The woman went on to ask Davey if he would help her friend, a victim of domestic violence going through the Family Courts, retain custody of her children.

Liverpool Crown Court heard how Davey said he had a friend - whom he named as 'Simon Davey' - who was a family law solicitor and could help the woman, who was struggling to pay for legal representation.

There was no such lawyer, and over the next four months Davey used this ruse to take payments from the woman, having promised to find her representation her at court.

He also claimed he had hired a private investigator to follow her ex-husband, and charged her for the service.

In total he took £8,000 from her.

Davey told the woman not to attend court and that 'Simon Davey' would represent her in her absence, but no one attended, leaving her unrepresented.

Even after this, Davey carried on the fiction, telling the woman that she'd been granted full custody of her children and compensation when this was not true.

He also told her on occasions to keep her children off school and produced fake legal documents and emails from Warrington Borough Council about her ex-husband's parental rights.

Still claiming to be a police officer, Davey went on to send the woman fake screenshots claiming that they were from the police.

He said that the police were involved in an operation to arrest an ex-husband of one of his victims for 14 offences, including terrorism and possession of indecent images of children.

He also forged a fake email from the Chief Constable of Merseyside Police to claim the man was going to be arrested.

Prosecuting, Nardeen Nemat said between January 2019 and April 2019 Davey asked for and obtained money from the victim on a regular basis.

This included £400-500 for private health scans, after Davey claimed that he feared he may have bowel cancer and that waiting for a scan on the NHS would take too long.

Davey was then introduced to another friend of the two women, also in family law proceedings against her ex-husband following domestic abuse.

He referred the woman, who wanted a non-molestation order to be put in place to protect herself and her daughter, to 'Simon Davey' in exchange for £475.

But despite the woman being told the order was now in place to protect them, no application was ever made.

The court heard Davey's crimes were finally discovered after staff at the Tune Hotel in Castle Street, Liverpool, where he was staying, became suspicious and googled his name.

The search brought up a series of news articles about earlier frauds he'd committed, prompting a member of staff to confront him via Whats App.

Davey never returned to the hotel, abandoning his possessions and staff contacted the police.

His bedroom was searched by the police and various articles were recovered that he'd used as part of his frauds, including police lanyards and files provided by the women to 'lawyer Simon Davey'.

The prosecutor said: 'Stephen Davey is a serial fraudster whose behaviour showed a disregard for the havoc and heartache he created in the lives of the people he conned.

'The women thought he was trying to help them with difficult family problems, yet he just made things so much worse.

'By telling the women that his ""solicitor friend"" was dealing with the Family Court matters and that they didn't need to attend court, he could have derailed their hopes of maintaining custody of their children.

'His behavior was reckless and heartless. Thankfully the women found the courage and perseverance to support this prosecution and help the Crown Prosecution Service build a strong case - so strong that Davey pleaded guilty at an early stage.'

In a victim impact statement read out by the prosecution, the first mother said she was seeking assistance from the family courts after an abusive relationship but she no longer trusts police, social services or legal representation as a result of Davey's actions.

She described how guilty she feels for allowing her children to get to know Davey and that they don't understand why they can't see 'Stephen Burns' again.

The victim says she feels 'extremely vulnerable and anxious' since the incident and has since been referred for counselling and given strong medication for her anxiety.

The court also heard how the second mother has been left feeling anxious and has suffered panic attacks at work where she has broken down and cried as a result of Davey's actions.

The prosecution said the victim was previously in a violent relationship and had been subject to mental torture, and following Davey's actions, she has been left feeling more vulnerable than ever before and fears that her daughter could be kidnapped.

She has also been left struggling to trust the police and says she is constantly looking over her shoulder.

Defending, Tom Watson said: 'He does accept that the two victims have suffered and have suffered as a result of what he has done and he does not wish them to suffer any further.

'The defendant knows this court will look at his record and see something of a life of crime and he does not attempt to deny that but he does attempt to give some form of apology for his behaviour.

'His criminal record is something which he is disgusted with himself for.'

The court heard how Davey, who has two children aged 21 and 23, enrolled on a online BA degree in Criminology and Psychology in 2015 because 'he does want to make something more of himself'.

Judge Warnock, said: 'The matter is complex and tortuous because you took complex and tortuous actions against your victims.

'The real harm in this case is the affect it had in the case involving these children.

'You have an appalling criminal record, you are a dishonest fraudster. You have been committing this type of offence for a long time with 94 offences for 17 convictions starting in 1987.

'The time has come for you to stop committing fraud and harm to others.'

Stephen Davey, of Kirkdale in Livcerpool, was sentenced to four years in jail for fraud and theft, with 25 per cent credit having to be given for his early guilty plea.

The court imposed a 10-year restraining order, which states that Davey must not contact any of the women or go to their addresses.

The restraining order also covers the Tune Hotel in Castle Street where Davey had been living at the time he committed his offences.

A Proceeds of Crime timetable was also set to recoup as much as possible of the money he took from the women.",fraud
TMML2024035948747,Said Ahmad SUNGKAR,"Alert ID: TMML2024035948747
WASHINGTON – Today, the U.S. Department of the Treasury designated two individuals based in Indonesia for their links to the terrorist groups Jemaah Islamiya (JI) and Jemmah Anshorut Tauhid (JAT). Said Ahmad Sungkar has been involved in fundraising efforts for JAT and supporting JI operatives. Afif Abdul Majid is a senior JAT leader who has overseen the recruitment and training of terrorists in Indonesia. These designations are part of the Treasury Department’s ongoing efforts to target these organizations as well as disrupt their financial and logistical support networks.

“The threats posed by terrorist groups such as Jemaah Islamiya and Jemmah Anshorut Tauhid remain significant. We will continue to take action to protect the international financial system from illicit activity tied to these groups, making it ever more difficult for them to carry out their acts of violence,” said Treasury Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence David S. Cohen.

The individuals sanctioned today were designated pursuant to E.O. 13224, which targets terrorists and their supporters. U.S. persons are generally prohibited from engaging in any transactions with the individuals designated today, and any assets of those designees subject to U.S. jurisdiction are frozen.

JI is a Southeast Asia-based terrorist network with links to al-Qaida. It has been designated by the UN and the United States since 2002 and is responsible for numerous acts of terrorism including the Bali bombing in 2002, in which over 200 people from 27 nations were killed.

JAT is also an Indonesia-based terrorist group with links to JI. In February 2012 the State Department designated JAT pursuant to Executive Order 13224 and added the group to its list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations, while the Department of the Treasury designated three JAT leaders: JAT’s acting Emir Mochammad Achwan, JAT spokesperson Son Hadi bin Muhadjir, and JAT leadership figure Abdul Rosyid Ridho Ba'asyir, who was involved in recruiting and fundraising activities.

JAT seeks to establish an Islamic caliphate in Indonesia, and has carried out numerous attacks on Indonesian Government personnel and civilians in order to achieve this goal. Abu Bakar Ba’asyir, the founder and leader of JAT, and a UN 1267 listed individual, was convicted and sentenced to prison in 2011 for his role in organizing a terrorist training camp in Aceh.

Said Ahmad Sungkar

Said Ahmad Sungkar (Sungkar) is being designated for providing financial, material, or technological support, or financial or other services, to JI and JAT. Sungkar has been involved in supporting Indonesia-based JI and JAT terrorist networks over a number of years. Most recently, Sungkar conducted fundraising and recruiting for JAT in 2013.

Sungkar previously had served as JI’s media chief. Also, on several occasions, Sungkar has extended logistics support to JI operatives seeking to evade capture and provided extremist operatives with fake documents.

In addition to providing support and services to JI and JAT Sungkar was linked to a terrorist training camp in 2010 in Aceh, Indonesia, that was under the leadership of senior JI operative Joko Pitono (a.k.a. Dulmatin) and gathered militants from various regional groups, including some with links to al-Qa’ida. The militants, using the name “al-Qa'ida in Aceh,” plotted to kill U.S. aid workers and Western tourists and attack churches and Western NGOs. Dulmatin was killed in an Indonesian police raid in March 2010.

Afif Abdul Majid

Afif Abdul Majid (Abdul Majid) is being designated for acting for or on behalf of JAT. Abdul Majid since 2008 has served as a JAT leader, overseeing JAT fighters. In 2012, Abdul Majid played a role in coordinating the activities of regional JAT leaders. Abdul Majid was a member of JAT’s governing council, also called the “Majelis Syuro,” from 2008 to 2013.

Abdul Majid also served as the head of JAT’s Central Java branch, as of late 2011. Abdul Majid in August 2010 conducted a swearing in ceremony for hundreds of JAT fighters, some of whom were expected to take violent action against the Indonesian police. In past years, Abdul Majid headed JAT recruitment efforts for a paramilitary wing that provided training for fighters, weapons experts, and hackers.

Abdul Majid has supported training activities for terrorist networks outside JAT, as well. As of early 2010, Abdul Majid donated approximately $2,000 to support the Aceh terrorist training camp, including weapons and ammunition purchases.

TMML2024038268755,Stephen Davey,"Alert ID: TMML2024038268755
A ""serial predatory fraudster"" pretended to be a police officer and solicitor to con domestic abuse victims, a court has heard.

Stephen Davey, 49, was jailed for four years for four fraud offences and a charge of theft at Liverpool Crown Court on Thursday.

Judge Robert Warnock said: ""He is a serial predatory fraudster, over a long period of time, throughout the country, targeting females.""

Sentencing Davey, he said: ""The time has come for you to stop committing fraud and causing so much harm to others.""

Davey, who has previously committed 57 fraud offences and 33 theft-related offences, has been described as ""one of Britain's most heartless love rats"" in tabloid newspapers in the past.

The court heard he contacted his two most recent victims, who cannot be named for legal reasons, through a woman who he met in a Liverpool bar.

He told the woman his name was Stephen Burns and he was a police officer and probation officer.

Nardeen Nemat, prosecuting, said the woman asked him to help her friends, who were both going through family court proceedings following abusive relationships, and he offered to put them in touch with a solicitor named Simon Davey, who did not exist.

The court heard one victim lost about £8,000 to Davey.

As well as paying him false legal fees, she paid for items including a television and PlayStation and gave him more than £400 for private health scans after he claimed he feared he had bowel cancer.

The other victim spent about £400 on legal fees.

Both victims, from Warrington, Cheshire, communicated with the bogus solicitor over email and were told by him not to attend family court hearings, Ms Nemat said.

In a statement read to the court, one victim said she felt Davey had portrayed her in a bad light to the family court, social services and her children's school.

The second victim, whose ex-partner had threatened to kidnap their child, said she felt she had been portrayed as ""unco-operative"" in the family court because Davey told her not to attend hearings.

She said: ""I cannot understand why he would put innocent children in danger and affect our lives so much.""

The court heard Davey sent fraudulent emails claiming to be from Warrington Borough Council and one from Merseyside Police Chief Constable Andy Cooke to back up his stories.

Tom Watson, defending, said Davey, originally of Wandsworth in London, accepted the victims had suffered and was remorseful.

Magistrates' court

Most criminal cases are heard in a magistrates' court. The magistrates are usually people who live in the local community, sometimes called justices of the peace. There are usually three magistrates who are supported by a legally trained advisor. Sometimes cases are tried by one magistrate, called a district judge, who is a lawyer.

Magistrates' courts are not as formal as the Crown Court, the magistrates do not wear wigs and only the ushers (court officials who keep everything running smoothly) wear black gowns.

Crown Court

Some cases are heard in the Crown Court. There are three situations where a case may be 'tried' at the Crown Court:

Serious crimes
Cases where the defendant (the person accused of the crime) has asked to have his case tried by a jury
Magistrates may send a case to the Crown Court if they feel they do not have the power to set a sentence as severe as the crime deserves

Cases at the Crown Court are tried by a jury. These are 12 people from the general public who listen to the evidence presented during the trial and decide if the defendant is guilty of the crime. The judge decides on matters of law during the trial, such as whether certain evidence is allowed to be presented. The judge also makes sure the trial proceeds in a fair way. At the end of the trial if the defendant is found guilty the judge decides the sentence for the crime (for example how long the defendant must spend in prison).

He said because of his past offending ""the internet follows him around"".

In an email shown to the court, the defendant's mother said: ""He works hard and keeps trying to get on with his life but can't and I think it's unfair that he's unable to move on.""

Mr Watson said Davey was studying for a degree in criminology and psychology and had been volunteering with the probation service following his release from an earlier prison sentence in 2017, but was recalled to prison for 28 days in November last year.

Detective Constable Laura Gilbert said: ""Stephen Davey is a manipulative and despicable individual who has knowingly preyed on extremely vulnerable victims.

""He is a career criminal whose only motivation throughout was to extort as much money as he could from his victims.""

Davey pleaded guilty to two counts of fraud by false representation, making articles for use in fraud, possessing articles to use in fraud and theft.",fraud and theft

Same way as they arrested Marry Mubaiwa – an open letter

Source: ZACC must now arrest Constantine Chiwenga – The Zimbabwean

Editor,

In this open letter to the Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission (ZACC), which I will copy to the international bodies who have been concerned about the Zimbabwean situation, I will want to argue that ZACC must now move in to arrest Vice-President Constantine Chiwenga, in the same way as the same body arrested Mary Chiwenga.

One of the charges Mary Mubaiwa has been arrested for involves externalizing foreign currency, a revelation made by Vice-President Chiwenga. Now that Mary Mubaiwa, the estranged former Army General’s wife, has also disclosed that the couple acquired properties outside the country, which have been registered in the names of family members and friends, some of the money used having been corruptly acquired from bribes given by business persons among other sources, ZACC must now move in and arrest the former army general. We are told by Mnangagwa and other Zanu PF heavyweights that no-one is above the law, so the Acting President must be arrested and prove his innocence in the courts of law.

The fact that the Acting President is now trying to persuade his estranged wife for an out of court settlement tells volumes. Mary should stand her grounds and refuse such advances from a cruel man who has tormented her so much. Mary needs protection from all well meaning people as she has some crucial information that could deal a huge blow to corruption by the top brass in the country.

A fraudster has been jailed today for seven years for conning elderly and vulnerable victims out of nearly £3m in a ‘boiler room’ fraud operation.

Mohammed Tanveer, 30, led an operation which cold-called potential victims and offered them the chance to invest in corporate bonds that were supposedly only available to private investors.

Victims were persuaded to invest huge sums of money - with one losing life savings of nearly £1m.

Tanveer was convicted of money laundering offences by a jury at Southwark Crown Court. He had already been found guilty of conspiracy to defraud in relation to the ‘boiler room’ scam at an earlier trial.

Three co-defendants - Lucy Richardson, 25, Mark Bowman, 55, Mandy Cross, 59 - were also convicted of money laundering offences today in relation to money from the scam.

Mandy Cross, the mother of co-defendant Shaun Cross, allowed more than £160,000 to pass through her account.

Barry Spearing, 58, was convicted of money laundering at an earlier trial. Shaun Cross, 30, Ryan Weston, 27, and Philip Hunt, 32, each pleaded guilty to money laundering at earlier court hearings.

Victims of the high-pressure sales tactic scam were shown marketing brochures and company reports to support the legitimacy of the scam and promised large annual returns of between 8-10%.

To make the investments seem more legitimate they were told their funds would be invested in large blue-chip companies such as Thames Water, BT and Rolls Royce.

Once they made an investment, victims received a fake ‘dividend’ payment, enticing them into further investments.

If victims continued to invest they received further dividends.

However, once the victims decided to stop investing any further, the dividends were stopped and brokers became unavailable.

The scam also caused more misery for existing victims, returning to them a second time and demanding money to help them with a bogus “exit strategy”.

More than 50 victims came forward as part of the investigation.

Alistair Dickson, from the CPS, said: “This was a particularly callous scam operation, where vulnerable victims lost their entire life savings on investments that simply didn’t exist.

“Common to each of the frauds was the fact that the individuals targeted were often elderly and vulnerable. Persuaded by the friendly nature of those who contacted them and the lengths to which these criminals had gone to make it all seem genuine, they trusted what they were being told. The reality is that the gang conned their way to nearly £3m.""

Former Police Commissioner-General Augustine Chihuri is suspected of diverting US$32 million of public funds into family companies and buying a large swathe of property, which the State now wants frozen pending the final outcome of possible criminal cases and civil suits.

During his 25 years at the helm of the police, Chihuri and his family acquired a lot of property and other assets.

So yesterday Prosecutor-General Mr Kumbirai Hodzi filed an application at the High Court seeking an order compelling Chihuri to explain how he acquired his properties and he wants all the assets still in Zimbabwe frozen until investigations and resulting court actions are complete.

Chihuri, his wife Isobel Halima Khan Chihuri, daughter Samantha Hamadziripi Chihuri, and son Ethan Takudzwa Augustine Chihuri were listed as the respondents in the application along with relatives Aitken and Netsai Khan and six companies: Croxile Investments, Adamah Enterprises, Mastermedia (Pvt) Ltd, Mastaw Investments and Rash Marketing.

In an affidavit deposed by Mr Hodzi, Chihuri is under investigation for criminal abuse of office, money laundering, theft and fraud. He accuses Chihuri of establishing a “syndicated criminal mafia” meant to siphon public funds for his personal benefit and that of his cronies. This would have entailed externalisation of money and money laundering abroad, he said.

Mr Hodzi contends that Chihuri established the companies in connivance with his relatives for the alleged purposes of siphoning funds from the Zimbabwe Republic Police’s revolving fund held under CBZ Account number 0212050619002.

Isobel Chihuri, according to the State, is the managing director for Mastaw Investments, which received US$3 823 285 from ZRP General Headquarters after giving an allegedly fake business address.

Rewstand Enterprises received US$10 401 500 from ZRP despite using an allegedly fake address. Investigations by the police found a different company operating from that address, said Mr Hodzi.

Nodpack Investments (Pvt) Ltd of Bure Close in Strathaven, Harare, whose directorship includes Clever Nziramasanga and had Isobel Halim Chihuri as general manager, allegedly received US$5 766 252.31 from the police. But, said Mr Hodzi, this address was a residential property for a Mrs Marange who does not know Nodpack, raising strong suspicion that the address was fake.

Croxile Investments (Pvt) Ltd of 8 St Aubins Walk in Chisipite received US$1 892 040 from the police, with Vanessa Madalisto Banda listed as director and Isobel Chihuri as general manager. But the property owner is a Mr Matongo who does not know about Croxile.

ZRP also released US$10 575 732 to Adamah Enterprises Pvt Ltd of 29 Carsberg Avenue in Alexandra Park in Harare. Isobel Chihuri is also general manager of this company with Nelia Mafunga listed as director. But investigations found this address belonged to another company called Brightcoast Construction owned by Clever Nziramasanga.

Mastermedia (Pvt) Ltd, according to the State, is owned by Isobel Khan Chihuri and it received US$1 073 038.08 from the ZRP Revolving Fund from January 5, 2016 to February 9, 2017.

Rash Marketing, which is owned by a CBZ employee called Shingirai Maponga and his spouse Sharon Maponga nee Tiyani, received US$764 370 from November 14, 2016 to December 12, 2016.

The companies won orders for the supply of goods and services without going to tender.

Besides the company dealings, the State is keen for Chihuri to explain his property holdings.

The State wants Chihuri to explain how he acquired 11 listed properties:

Economist Jeff Sachs was furious with President Donald Trump and the White House’s decision to pull the United States out of the Paris Climate Agreement. In a panel discussion on CNN Friday, Sachs went off on everyone, including Trump’s economic advisor Steve Moore and the conservative funders Charles and David Koch.

“It’s just unbelievable,” Sachs said, disgusted. “Every word has been a lie for the last two days. And you have Stephen Moore. And he is from the Heritage Foundation, paid for by the ‘Koch Brothers’ that have engineered the whole story here. So it’s just endless big money of the Koch brothers is behind this. And Mr. Moore and his Heritage Foundation is a Koch Brothers-financed operation. And this is corruption! And it’s so clear and it’s disgusting after a while because they’re all lying.”

Sachs called BS.

“ I know where I’m getting my facts from! You’re on the take!” he said, insinuating that Moore was being bribed. “I am shocked that you are a correspondent for this network.”

The latest boss of the Di Lauro clan of the Neapolitan Mafia or Camorra has been captured in Naples.

Mariano Abete was the son for former boss Argangelo Abete and was known in the Italian media as “ Baby Boss ” taking over the family at age twenty one. He took over as head of the mafia family after his fathers arrest and the murder of his uncle. Mariano was now leading the family in a bloody war over drug turf against the Scissionisti clan a rival Camorra faction. The turf war has claimed the lives of dozens of known mobsters from both clans in recent months. Despite his age Italian police say that Mariano was a very powerful and dangerous mobster.

Abete was found hiding in a small hidden room in his mothers house in Naples. Police began to break down the wall when his mother intervened begging police not to hurt him and opening the secret doorway to the room. The room was nothing more then a small space hidden between two walls that was accessed by a movable wall operated by remote control. The small space contained only a canister of oxygen , mattress, pillow, and a crucifix.

Archangel Abete sometimes referred to as super boss because he led a splinter factions rebellion against the ruling family of the Neapolitan Mafia. Being the son of the so called super boss made Mariano mafia royalty says Italian police. Mariano is also the newphew of a notorious mafia don murdered in September in an ambush as revenge for the murder of a rival mafioso known was “Wooden Hands”. The mobster got the nickname because he had lost both hands years ago when a home made bomb exploded and now wore prosthetics. The hit on Mariano’s uncle was the latest murder in the bloody turf war.",arrest of mafia member

Once called the ""King of Good Times"" due to his extravagant lifestyle, controversial Indian tycoon Vijay Mallya has been embroiled in financial scandals since 2012.

Accused of fleeing from India in 2016 after defaulting on debts of more than $1bn (£785m), a London court has now ruled he should be extradited from the UK to India where he faces fraud charges - charges he denies.

The extradition ruling will be passed to the Home Secretary for approval. If he is sent home from the UK and found guilty, it will be a spectacular fall from grace for a man whose lifestyle brands have achieved global recognition and who has even spent time as a politician.

Mr Mallya became chairman of conglomerate United Breweries Group in 1983 aged just 28, inheriting the job when his father died.

It is best known for producing Kingfisher, India's most popular beer, but has also branched out into chemicals, paints and publishing, buying The Asian Age newspaper and Bollywood film magazine Cine Blitz.

However, the businessman's more recent ventures have courted controversy.

Kingfisher Airlines, launched in 2005, grew to become India's second largest domestic carrier, but racked up debts of more than $1bn (£755m) - much of which remains outstanding.

It was wound down in 2012 amid reports that pilots and cabin crew had worked unpaid for 15 months.

Mr Mallya was also forced to resign as chairman of United Spirits, India's biggest distiller, after its new owner Diageo accused him of financial wrongdoing.

Diageo is now suing the tycoon to recover payments worth $181m.

Despite the controversies Mr Mallya has maintained his trademark flamboyance and indulged his passions.

He helped co-found a Formula 1 team, Force India (although it went into administration in July when his assets were frozen), and bought Indian Premier League cricket franchise Royal Challengers Bangalore for more than £70m.

He was even a member of the upper house of India's parliament, elected in 2002 and then again in 2010. He quit in 2016 amid allegations of wrongdoing.

Since then his creditors and regulators have been closing in.

A group of Indian banks are seeking to recover more than $1bn of loans granted to his defunct Kingfisher Airlines.

And India's fraud office is investigating claims he funnelled loans to the struggling airline via other firms, and hid personal assets.

The businessman has denied all allegations, labelling the investigation against him as a ""witch hunt"".",fraud
