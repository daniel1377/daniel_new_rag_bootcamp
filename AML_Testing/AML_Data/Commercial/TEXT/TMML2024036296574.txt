The man convicted in the murder of Buffalo native John Granville has been designated a terrorist by the United States government.

U.S. Attorney William Hochul Jr. confirmed that the U.S. State Department has issued the designation for Abd Al-Ra’Ouf Abu Zaid Mohamed Hamza under Executive Order 13224, which targets terrorists and those providing support to terrorists or acts of terrorism.

Hamza and three co-conspirators participated in an armed attack in Khartoum, Sudan on January 1, 2008 which led to the death of Granville, who was serving as a U.S. Diplomat at the time. He was working on democracy and governance programs while serving with the U.S. Agency for International Development. A U.S. Embassy staff member was also killed in the attack.

“As the office that is leading the criminal investigation into this terrible crime, this is certainly welcome news,” Hochul said, of the designation. “This action puts the world on notice that anyone aiding this individual will, along with the defendant, eventually be brought to justice.”

The decision to issue the terrorist designation means two things. First, all property subject to U.S. jurisdiction in which Hamza has any interest is blocked and any assets he may have under U.S. jurisdiction are frozen. Additionally, American citizens are generally prohibited from engaging in transactions with a designated terrorist.

Hamza and his co-conspirators were convicted of murder and sentenced to death in a Sudanese criminal court in 2009. All four escaped from a maximum security prison the following year, killing a Sudanese police officer during the escape. Hamza was eventually recaptured and is currently in prison in Khartoum, the capital of Sudan.
