WASHINGTON (AP) — An American security contractor is accusing two top-ranking Congolese officials of ordering his detention and torture, declaring in a lawsuit that they demanded he confess falsely to being part of a plot to overthrow the country’s government.

Darryl Lewis, an Air Force veteran, said in an Associated Press interview this week that he was illegally held in Congo’s capital, Kinshasa, for nearly six weeks and interrogated for as much as 16 hours a day by members of Congo’s national intelligence agency.

Congo’s intelligence chief, Kalev Mutond, and Congolese Justice Minister Alexis Thambwe Mwamba, “acted in concert” to have him detained, tortured and “threatened with indefinite imprisonment on false charges,” according to the lawsuit, filed July 29 in federal court in Washington.

“I feared for my life from the day they captured me,” Lewis, 48, said. He said he never confessed.

Congo’s ambassador, Francois Balumuene, said in a statement Thursday that Lewis was detained because he did not have the proper work permit. He denied Lewis had been mistreated and called his lawsuit “unsubstantiated allegations.”

Law enforcement authorities in Congo released Lewis on June 8 after “extensive diplomatic efforts and negotiations,” the lawsuit said. Lewis is seeking at least $4.5 million in compensatory and punitive damages.

The lawsuit comes amid mounting tensions ahead of November presidential elections in Congo. Opposition leaders claim that President Joseph Kabila wants to delay the vote so he can stay in power past his mandate that expires at the end of the year. The country’s constitution bars Kabila from running for a third term.

Congo’s relations with Washington have frayed over the last year due to repeated reports that Kabila’s government has cracked down on political foes and activists. The U.S. Treasury Department in June sanctioned a top Congolese police official who activists say is linked to dozens of deaths. The department’s statement announcing the sanctions against Celestin Kanyama noted a “pattern of repression” by Kabila’s government.

Lewis had been working as an unarmed security adviser for Moise Katumbi, Congo’s leading opposition candidate for president. Katumbi, one of Kabila’s harshest critics, has been charged separately by authorities in Congo with hiring mercenaries. Katumbi and his supporters have denied the allegation and say the move is aimed at derailing his bid for the presidency.

In the lawsuit, Mwamba is described as being convinced that Lewis and hundreds of other U.S. citizens had infiltrated Congo since last October to help Katumbi overthrow the government and assassinate Kabila. Lewis’ military background made him especially suspect. At a May 4 press conference, Mwamba displayed as evidence a photo of Lewis holding a large machine gun.

Lewis said the photo was taken in 2009 when he was working as a contractor in Kosovo. Congolese authorities must have pulled it from his LinkedIn account, he said. The photo has since been replaced with another of Lewis.

Mwamba declined to comment on the specifics of Lewis’ lawsuit. “A Congolese who would be found to have acted in the U.S. as Lewis did in the (Congo) surely would have to explain himself before the FBI and other authorities,” he said.

The lawsuit said Lewis and three colleagues were “stopped and surrounded” by Congolese riot police on April 24 as they were driving near a political rally that Katumbi had attended in the city of Lubumbashi. They were unarmed and breaking no laws, according to Lewis. He was the only American in the group.

Soon, several members of Congo’s intelligence agency, who were not named in the suit, arrived. They handcuffed and physically assaulted Lewis and his colleagues. At one point, a car door was slammed into his elbow, the lawsuit said.

Lewis said they were taken to a “filthy, unsanitary” jail in Lubumbashi and put in separate cells. He was assaulted and abused, according to the lawsuit. His bound hands were pulled up behind his back, creating painful pressure on his shoulder joints. During the night, Lewis could hear his captors “brutally beat” and interrogate one of his colleagues. “You’re next,” Lewis said he was warned.

The next day Lewis was transported to the intelligence agency’s headquarters in Kinshasa. Over the next six weeks, he was questioned for long periods and deprived of sleep, according to the lawsuit. His captors gave him just one small meal a day. Lewis said his captors also began a series of “mind games,” such as using information about his ailing mother, to wear him down and secure a confession.

Lewis was not charged with a crime before he was released.","Corruption, multiple people"

KARACHI: The Sindh High Court on Wednesday dismissed Federal Investigation Agency's appeal against the acquittal of forex company Khanani and Kalia directors in Hawala case. The forex company Khanani and Kalia (Kand K) directors Hanif S Kali, Abdul Munaf Kalia, Javed Khanani, Altaf Khanani, Atif Aziz Polani, Abdul Aziz Polani, Javed Qasim, Amir Zakaria, Iqbal Kasbati were acquitted by the trial court on October 29, 2013. They were booked by the FIA on a complaint of the State Bank of Pakistan for running illegal foreign exchange company and parallel banking channel.

According to the FIA case, the K&K directors illegally transacted foreign exchange worth billions of US dollars in collusion with different exchange companies, money changers and businessmen. The FIA alleged that the defendants fraudulently created replica website clik.pk.net without informing the SBP to illegally transfer money from and outside Pakistan. They also set up offices at foreign destinations and appointed Atif Polani and Javed Qasim as focal persons to execute the illegal transactions.

The K&K directors were alleged to have received amounts from overseas Pakistanis through foreign exchange companies for remitting it to the country, but instead of transferring the amount to Pakistan through authorized banks duly declared by the SBP, they would retain the amount abroad or transfer it to any foreign currency account opened in collusion with persons to conceal the remittance. The prosecution alleged that the defendants held the foreign currency and did not sell or declare it to the SBP while equivalent amount payable against the remittance was distributed in Pakistan to the recipients depriving Pakistan of remittances worth billions of US dollars. They were also charged with manipulating the foreign exchange in favour of different foreign companies as Hawala transfer at the behest of businessmen to meet the under invoiced amount required to be paid illegally to foreign exporters with misdeclared exports to evade the import duty and taxes and obtained commission for these services.

Moises Humberto Rivera-Luna, alias “El Viejo Santos,” is one of six Mara Salvatrucha leaders the US Treasury Department blacklisted in June 2013. Three years and three months earlier, on March 9, 2010, an FBI patrol raided a house in a Latino neighborhood in Maryland. There, they found the first evidence of a new relationship between MS13 cliques along the US East Coast and its imprisoned leadership in El Salvador.

This evidence consisted of two receipts for money transfers made via Western Union by Edgar Granados, a member of the Normandie Locos Salvatruchos clique. The money was received in El Salvador by a woman named Julia Perez Abarca, who, at that time, was regularly visiting Viejo Santos in the Chalatenango prison. Following the raid, an investigation revealed that ties between El Salvador’s imprisoned “big bosses” and the “shot-callers” (palabreros) along the US East Coast had been revitalized.

This story is reprinted with permission from Revista Factum. See the original Spanish version here.

Involved in this restoration of ties were certain gang members who played a role in the gang truce with the government of ex-President Mauricio Funes. Revista Factum has reconstructed this chapter of the MS13’s history in Maryland via an exhaustive review of judicial documents and hours of interviews with police, defense lawyers, and ex-gang members in San Salvador.

The MS13 in the Washington DC Area

March 19, 2010 was a Friday. Jose Martinez Amaya, alias “Crimen,” and Manuel Saravia received a call from El Salvador. Speaking on the other end was Viejo Santos, the boss of the Normandie Locos Salvatruchos (NLS) clique. He was calling from the Chalatenango prison to inform the two they had been named palabreros (“shot-callers”) of the NLS in Maryland. It had been just three years since Jose, at 19 years of age, had left San Miguel for the United States.

Jose’s life story is similar to thousands of other Salvadoran youths who — after their parents emigrated north — were raised by their grandparents; growing up in towns and neighborhoods that just 15 years ago were not very dangerous. Back then, MS13 and Barrio 18 graffiti on neighborhood walls was still non-threatening.

Jose was born in 1988 in San Miguel, and is the third of four children who never knew their father. When he was six, Jose’s mother left for the United States with his two oldest siblings. Jose and his brother were left in the care of their maternal grandparents. Jose later told a Maryland social worker his grandmother mistreated him, frequently forcing him to kneel on gravel and hitting him with a wooden cane.

Jose became one of at least five members of the Normandie clique in Maryland, who sent small weekly sums of money to Viejo Santos — the clique’s supreme leader in El Salvador.

According to a document issued by the US District Court for the District of Columbia — which on June 26 sentenced Jose to life in prison for homicide — Jose entered the United States in 2007 as an undocumented migrant. He traveled to Maryland’s Latino suburbs were his mother lived. After attending the local high school for three months, Jose dropped out, and began working construction with Genco Constructions in Bethesda, one of Washington DC’s richest suburbs.

It was not long, however, before Jose left home — after 12 years apart, his mother had become a stranger to him. He was now making enough money from his construction job to be able to move in with his girlfriend. He also began sending money to a son he left behind in El Salvador.

Jose’s mother says her son was already tattooed when he arrived from El Salvador. She insists, however, that MS13 members in San Miguel forced Jose to “stain himself,” and that he did it for his own safety. Yet gang rules imply that having a tattoo of the letters MS without authorization — that is, without being an active member — can be grounds for death.

Documents from the Washington DC court regarding the personal history of Jose Martinez Amaya indicate that when he crossed the Rio Grande, he was already a fully initiated member of the Normandie clique.

SEE ALSO: MS13 News and Profiles

What is known for sure — and is included in the FBI documents annexed to Martinez Amaya’s sentencing memorandum (case number 10-256-09) — is that Martinez Amaya started participating in Normandie clique meetings near the end of 2008 — a little over a year after he arrived in the United States. According to police records, between November 2008 and New Year’s Eve 2009, Martinez Amaya and Manuel Saravia, alias “Cholo,” sold cocaine in Silver Spring, beat up a member of another clique, and stabbed at least one person in Langley Park, a well-known MS13 stronghold in Maryland.

At the end of 2009, Martinez became one of at least five members of the Normandie clique in Maryland, identified by the FBI, who sent small weekly sums of money to Viejo Santos, the clique’s supreme leader in El Salvador. (According to a 2001 Salvadoran police intelligence report, Viejos Santos is also one of the founding members of the MS13 in El Salvador). This remittance came from extortion and drug dealing.

Orders from Chalatenango

The beginning of 2010, when Jose Martinez Amaya and Manuel Saravia were named “palabreros,” was a hectic period. Viejo Santos had been exerting strict control over the Normandie clique from El Salvador, insisting on compliance with certain rules. It was also around this time that the Normandie clique received orders from El Salvador to expand their operations in the United States.

Below is an official investigator’s account of a phone call about these plans, to which Revista Factum had access:

In March 2010 Moises Humberto Rivera Luna participated in a three-person conference call. Of the two other people, one was located in the Washington metropolitan area, while the other was in another state. During the conversation, Rivera Luna commented that later that same day he would be participating in a phone meeting with people in Maryland, New York, and Los Angeles. Rivera Luna said it was important for members of the Normandie clique in Washington to go to other cities to ensure gang members in those areas were comporting themselves appropriately. Normandie clique members could also play an advising role, teaching gang members in these cities how to recruit new members and fend off rivals.

Several months before this call, near the end of November 2009, Rivera Luna participated in another conference call. This call included Marvin Geovanny Monterroa Larios, alias “Enano” — another leader imprisoned in El Salvador — and representatives from the Uniones, Normandie, and Western Locos cliques in Maryland. These are three of the six MS13 that had consolidated in Washington by that time, according to the FBI. The other three cliques are the Sailors Locos, the Peajes, and the Fulton Locos.

In this November teleconference, Enano and Viejo Santos gave an implicit order to refocus attention on the Maryland and Washington region. The most powerful cliques were to return to the gang’s founding precepts: control territory, and earn respect and money using the gang’s main currency: violence.

Viejo Santos, head of the Normandie Locos clique, who gave orders and received remittances from MS13 members based in the US

The order was similar to one from nearly a decade earlier. In 2003, according to several gang leaders, the order for the MS13 to expand throughout El Salvador came from the United States. The call was for the gang to develop a culture of violence, as well as increased organization in Central America, as part of the gang’s expansion in the region. In 2010, a similar order — but solely focused on the Washington DC area — made its way north.

Following this conference between gang members in the El Salvador prisons and gang members on the Maryland streets, a federation of cliques came into being called “The Brotherhood.” During an off-the-record conversation, a US federal agent confirmed this federation is still active.

“The Brotherhood’s purpose is to investigate if members from other cliques are cooperating with law enforcement and, if so, to kill them,” the agent said. In other words, the group gives the green light to murder snitches.

A few months after The Brotherhood’s creation, Viejo Santos — leader of the Normandie’s clique — and Enano had consolidated the gang in the Maryland and Washington neighborhoods.

According to US Justice Department prosecutors, by January 2010, US elements of the MS13 were colluding with leaders in El Salvador. For example, on January 9, Monterrosa Larios spoke by telephone with a member of the Unions clique in Langley Park about the possibility of sending someone from San Miguel to carry out a murder in Maryland. By the end of the month, Enano was coordinating a special operation from his prison cell in El Salvador: the search for a safe house, meant to shelter members of the Fulton clique at risk of being deported.

It was the first time since 2005 that police from Maryland’s Montgomery County, the District of Columbia, and the FBI handled a case in which the highest levels of the MS13’s leadership had ordered an assassination in the US.

On March 7, 2010, Viejo Santos asked another member of the NLS, who used the alias “Cocky,” what he knew about the behavior of Felipe Leonardo Enriquez, alias “Zombie,” a gang member that, according to Viejo Santos, had “disrespected the Normandie” by covering up a tattoo of the clique.

Cocky, however, was unwilling to carry out the orders coming from El Salvador. He stopped answering the bosses’ calls and fled. On May 5, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) arrested him for being in the United States without immigration documents. Viejo Santos took this as a betrayal.

“The big boss was angry with Zombie over the tattoo, and with Cocky because he had stopped answering his phone calls,” a witness said at the trial against the NLS members that began in Washington in 2012.

After Cocky’s fall from grace, Martinez Amaya and Saravia were selected to carry out Viejo Santos ’ orders.

Saravia and Martinez Amaya teleconferenced with Viejo Santos on March 31. It was done, they said. Zombie was dead. They, along with another gang member, Noe Machado Erazo, had executed him. It was Martinez Amaya, however, who fired the coup de grâce.

It was the first time since 2005 that police from Maryland’s Montgomery County, the District of Columbia, and the FBI handled a case in which the highest levels of the MS13’s leadership had ordered an assassination in the US.

From 2005 to 2007, a federal court in Greenbelt, Maryland convicted 24 members from various MS13 cliques for three murders, possession and carrying of firearms, obstruction of justice, and racketeering. According to prosecutors, at least two of the killings had also been ordered from El Salvador. Those times, though, the orders came from Saul Antonio Angel Turcios, alias “El Trece,” a leader of the Tecla Locos Salvatruchos (TLS) clique who would also participate in the negotiation of the 2012 gang truce.

The silence — or “relative calm,” as one Maryland detective speaking on the condition of anonymity referred to it — that prevailed in the area following the trials of the mid-2000s was definitively broken.

The Wheaton Seizure

Randolph Road has four lanes (two going each direction) and extends through most of Montgomery County, which is home to tens of thousands of Salvadorans and Central Americans. Wheaton-Glenmont — located about 20 kilometers north of the White House — is one of the cities this road goes through. On March 9, 2010, unmarked FBI cars and county police patrols drove to a house near the intersection of Randolph and Veirs Mill Road. It was the home of a Normandie clique member: Edgar Granados, alias “Babyface.”

In a trash can in the house’s kitchen, police found two Western Union receipts, evidence of two wire transfers of money — one of $50 and the other of $350. Granados was sending the money to a woman in El Salvador named Julia Perez Abarca.

With these two receipts, the FBI began to connect the dots. Agent Jason Brumbelow was in charge of the investigation. The case was so large and complex that it would be another two years before the Normandie clique was brought to trial.

Julia Perez Abarca was the first link. A July 17, 2013 conversation between Agent Brumbelow and assistant prosecutor Nijar Rantay Mohany during the trial of Jose Martinez Amaya and Noe Machado Erazo is quite revealing in this respect. The exchange discusses Julia Perez Abarca’s connection to the receipts found in the Randolph Road home and the final destination of the remittances: Viejo Santos, who until June 2010 was incarcerated in El Salvador’s Chalatenango prison. The exchange went as follows:

Prosecutor Mohany: Who was Edgar Granados sending the money to in El Salvador?

Agent Brumbelow: Julia Perez Abarca.

Mohany (to the judge): Your honor, evidence piece 155 of the government are stamped Salvadoran documents…

Mohany (to Agent Brumbelow): I’m going to direct your attention to the screen so you can see the document I am putting up with the court’s permission… Do you see what is on the screen?

(Prosecutor Mohany shows a certified copy of a sign-in sheet for visitors to several MS13 members incarcerated in Salvadoran prisons.)

Brumbelow: Yes, I see it.

Mohany: Ok. It says, in Spanish, the visits made to Moises Humberto Rivera. Do you see that?

Brumbelow: Yes, I see it.

Mohnay: Who is that person?

Brumbelow: Moises Humberto Rivera, Viejo Santos.

Mohany: Ok. Do you see this name? Domitala de la Paz Portillo.

Brumbelow: Yes.

Mohany: Is this name important to your investigation?

Brumbelow: We have information that we extracted from Western Union’s files indicating various members of the Normandie clique were sending money to her.

Mohany: And this name that appears further down, do you recognize it?

Brumbelow: Yes. Julia Perez Abarca.

At the end of this questioning — which started at 10:30 a.m. and ended at 3:16 p.m. that day — and after numerous objections from the defense, the Justice Department’s representatives had established the following points: between January and March 2010, three members of the Normandie clique in Maryland, including Edgar Martinez Granados and Jose Amaya, alias “Crimen,” had made at least 12 remittance payments to Michelle Rios, Domitila de la Paz Portillo, and Julia Perez Abarca; and these last two women had visited Viejo Santos in Chalatenango on several occasions. (According to records from El Salvador’s prison directorate, Viejo Santos was transferred to the maximum-security prison in Zacatecoluca in June 2010.)

At least two US federal agencies — in addition to the FBI and the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) — had followed the trail of these wire transfers made from Washington and Maryland to Monterrosa Larios, alias “Enano” (The Dwarf).

On June 5, 2013 — three years after finding the Western Union receipts in Edgar Granados’ house — the Treasury Department declared Viejo Santos and Enano the subjects of criminal investigations by the US government. According to police sources in El Salvador, the two men were part of the MS13 leadership that had participated in truce negotiations with rivals the Barrio 18 and the government of President Mauricio Funes. The government was represented at these negotiations by state and military intelligence agents under the order of Security Minister Gen. David Munguia Payes and General Francisco Salinas, the director of the national police (PNC).

MS13 Leaders with Influence in the US

The name Moises Humberto Rivera Luna (now 44 years old) — and his alias “Viejo Santos” — is rarely mentioned in newspaper headlines. Nor does his name come up in the few and contradictory statements Salvadoran authorities make about the gang truce. Nor is the name Monterrosa Larios (now 41 years old) heard very much. However, according to US and Salvadoran police, both men are important MS13 leaders.

“Moises Humberto Rivera Luna is an international leader of the MS13, sending orders and instructions to cliques in the Washington area from his prison in El Salvador via cell phone,” a US federal agent said. “Monterrosa Larios, also imprisoned in El Salvador, leads the coalition of MS13 cliques that has formed in the Washington area.”

One document, entitled “The MS Gang Phenomenon in El Salvador” — prepared by the Salvadoran Center for Police Intelligence in July 2011 — consists of a 39-slide PowerPoint presentation detailing the basic functions of the gang, its rules, its communication methods, and its leadership. On the fifth slide, titled “Hierarchical Status of the Gang,” appear 13 names of gang members who police have identified as founders of the MS13 in El Salvador. The third name on that list is Viejo Santos. Also included are the leaders of the truce: Borromeo Henriquez Solorzano, alias “Diablito de Hollywood,” Adalberto Ricardo Diaz, alias “Rata de Leewards,” and Saul Antonio Angel Turcios, alias “El Trece.”

A Salvadoran police intelligence report names Viejo Santos — who ordered other gang associates killed in the Washington DC area — as one of the founders of the MS13 in El Salvador.

According to a June 2007 decision issued by a court in Greenbelt, Maryland, between 2005 and 2007, El Trece became the first top MS13 leader incarcerated in El Salvador to authorize executions and order extortions in Maryland (he was imprisoned in Zacatecoluca in 2006). His criminal case (No. DKC-05-0393) — which included charges of homicide and racketeering — said that, through the Teclas Locos Salvatruchos (TLS) clique, he was able to increase his power and influence over the gang during those years.

SEE ALSO: Coverage of El Salvador gang truce

Several examples of this influence are contained in records annexed to El Trece’s criminal trial (No. 199-1-2006) for racketeering, which was resolved by a Santa Tecla court on October 9, 2006. Information in these documents puts Angel Turcios’ date of birth as May 17, 1975. He attended school through the fourth grade, and worked in a metal factory where he earned $9 a day. The unofficial biography, however, taken from the testimonies of fellow TLS members who became witnesses for the prosecution in this trial, is much less modest.

Nonetheless, despite the life sentences handed down in these recent trials… communications between the Salvadoran jails and the streets of metropolitan Washington remain active…

One of the witnesses in the Santa Tecla trial said that near the end of 2005, El Trece began receiving up to $4,000 a week as “tribute,” a gang reference to quotas from criminal activities paid to the maximum leader. The 16 cliques he controlled in the La Libertad area paid these fees to him. The year 2005 also saw weapons sales produce two income payments of around $9,000 and $10,000, respectively. Estimated roughly, Angel Turcios was receiving about $670 a day from the tributes alone. According to the judge in Maryland, he was also receiving money from the United States during this period.

In 2010, the MS13 leader receiving tributes from the United States was Viejo Santos. This development essentially reversed the way the gangs had initially expanded — with orders traveling from North America to to Central America, as opposed to vice versa.

The Normandie and Viejo Santos case was so important for the US government that the FBI and DHS did not hesitate to offer Luis Avila Mendez, a gang member from Maryland, an S visa. These are typically reserved for witnesses in criminal cases of great significance.

This visa allowed Avila Mendez to collaborate with authorities and record meetings where criminal acts were discussed. According to immigration lawyers from Baltimore, the S visa is very difficult to obtain. In fact, even in this case the process was problematic because Avila Mendez had committed other crimes while collaborating with the authorities.

Despite Manuel Saravia also being identified by police as an accomplice in one of the murders for which Jose Martinez Amaya was sentenced to life imprisonment, Saravia’s punishment was not as severe. This is because he confessed to authorities that Martinez Amaya committed the murder: “It seems that the jury found Mr. Martinez guilty of murdering Felipe Enriquez, who was known as Zombie, based solely on the testimony of Manuel Saravia,” the court decision reads.

Nonetheless, despite the life sentences handed down in these recent trials, and the attention the US Treasury Department has placed on MS13’s imprisoned leadership in El Salvador, communications between the Salvadoran jails and the streets of metropolitan Washington are as active as they were in 2005 and 2006. Indeed, the MS13 has proven capable of practicing a variety of illicit activities. According to authorities, this includes extortion and other crimes — namely, prostitution — that they had not previously carried out in the United States.

An unknown attacker breached the servers of Panama firm Mossack Fonseca and has leaked sensitive files, revealing a worldwide corruption ring and a complex tax evasion system used by the world's richest persons.

The incident took place at the start of 2015, when the hacker breached Mossack Fonseca, a corporate consultancy and law firm located in Panama.

The person(s) behind the leak took the data, consisting of 2.6TB, over 11.5 million files, and offered it for analysis to German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung.

It took over 400 journalists to analyze the leaked documents

The German newspaper was so overwhelmed by the data it had to analyze that it called for the help of US-based International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), who coordinated the investigation by distributing the documents for analysis to over 400 journalists in 107 news organizations.

Leaked data contained scanned and electronic documents from the 1970s, when Mossack Fonseca started, and up to early 2015.

During their investigation, journalists had to use special software to index and analyze the data. OCR (Optical Character Recognition) software was used to transform scan documents to electronic versions so they could be indexed and categorized for easier searching and analysis.

After a monumental work, yesterday, on April 3, 2016, ICIJ, together with Süddeutsche Zeitung, revealed their first analysis of the leaked documents, which only included data from 149 files of the total of 11.5 million.

From the currently leaked documents, it appears that some of the world's richest persons, some of whom were politicians and even head of states, used Mossack Fonseca to set up shell corporations in various tax havens around the globe and avoid paying taxes back home.

The data breach has its own name: Panama Papers

The leak, which is now known as the Panama Papers, has its own website where ICIJ says its journalists will start publishing new documents from now on, just as Edward Snowden uses The Intercept website and Julian Assange uses WikiLeaks.

Last Friday, probably after being contacted by members of the press for a request for comment, Mossack Fonseca sent an email to its clients acknowledging the breach of an email server.

Edward Snowden described Panama Papers on Twitter as the ""biggest leak in the history of data journalism.""

A who's who of world politics

Incriminated politicians and world figures include President of Argentina Mauricio Macri, former Prime Minister of Georgia Bidzina Ivanishvili, Iceland's Prime Minister Sigmundur Davíð Gunnlaugsson, UAE President & Abu Dhabi emir Khalifa bin Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, King of Saudi Arabia Salman bin Abdulaziz bin Abdulrahman Al Saud, Ex-Prime Minister of Iraq Ayad Allawi, President of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko, convicted former Ukraine Prime Minister Pavlo Lazarenko, former President of Sudan Ahmad Ali al-Mirghani, and several others.

Additionally, there is the daughter of former Chinese Premier Li Xiaolin, Azerbaijan's first family, several FIFA officials, soccer star Lionel Messi, several musicians, childhood friends of Russian President Putin, cousins of Syrian President Bashar Assad, father of current British prime minister, and many other more. Honestly, the list could go on for at least a few more paragraphs.

Besides these high-profile names, the leaked documents also contain documents such as email chains, invoices, and money transfers for offshore companies that facilitated bribery, arms deals, tax evasion, financial fraud, drug trafficking, human trafficking, and all sorts of other crimes.

Panama Papers is the biggest data leak ever

The Panama Papers incident is technically the world's biggest data leak, dwarfing WikiLeaks, which was only 0.06% of its size.

ICIJ investigators say the data leak included 4.8 million emails, 3 million database files, 2,15 million PDF files, 1.1 million photos, and 0.32 million text files.

Both Süddeutsche Zeitung and ICIJ are running separate sites for the Panama Papers leak, which you should definitely follow from now on.

Cyber-attacks have been levied against journalists in Angola after they reported that the Angolan president’s chief of staff had embezzled public funds.

Independent online news provider Correio Angolense published an article online covering the claims against Edeltrudes Costa that were first made by the Portuguese TV channel Televisão Independente (TVI).

The broadcaster launched an investigation after companies owned by Costa were awarded several major contracts by the government, including a multi-million-dollar contract to renovate Angola’s airports. TVI alleged that Costa transferred public money paid to his businesses to offshore accounts in Panama and Portugal, then used it to acquire luxury properties.

Shortly after Correio Angolense covered the allegations, the website of the news provider was hit by a denial-of-service (DDoS) attack. As a result, the website has been inaccessible since September 25.

Its editor, Graça Campos, told Reporters Without Borders (RSF) that the site was crashed by thousands of simultaneous connection attempts in what appeared to be a deliberate cyber-attack.

RSF’s former Angola correspondent, freelance journalist Siona Casimiro, was also the target of a cyber-attack after he worked on the Costa embezzlement story.

Casimiro told RSF: “There can be no doubt about the desire to silence journalists with regard to the Edeltrudes Costa affair.”

Combatting corruption has been one of President João Lourenço’s key pledges since his election in 2017. When news of Costa’s alleged crime broke, around 200 people took to the streets of the nation’s capital Luanda to protest and call for the chief of staff’s resignation.

Lourenço’s campaign against corruption led to the imprisonment in August of José Filomeno dos Santos, son of Angola’s former president José Eduardo dos Santos, who served as the country’s head of state from 1979 to 2017. José Filomeno was sentenced to five years in prison after diverting oil revenues from Angola’s sovereign wealth fund, which he oversaw from 2013 to 2018.

An investigation is ongoing into the activities of his half-sister Isabel dos Santos, who, according to Africa News, is suspected of “a long list of crimes including mismanagement, embezzlement and money laundering during her stewardship of state oil giant Sonangol.”",corruption

WASHINGTON (AP) - The government on Wednesday designated six leaders of the violent street gang MS-13 as international criminals, stepping up a crackdown on the sprawling U.S. and Central American gang's finances.

The Treasury Department in October designated MS-13, or Mara Salvatrucha, as an international criminal organization. The Obama administration said that makes the gang subject to penalties by the Office of Foreign Assets Control and gives the U.S. an opportunity to hinder MS-13's ability to funnel money to its leaders in El Salvador or launder criminal proceeds through otherwise legitimate businesses.

Adding the names of six of the gang's purported leaders allows the U.S. to target their bank accounts individually.

The men added to the transnational criminal organization designation are: Moris Alexander Bercian Manchon, 28; Jose Misael Cisneros Rodriguez, 37; Marvin Geovanny Monterrosa-Larios, 39; Moises Humberto Rivera-Luna, 44; Saul Antonio Turcios Angel, 35; and Borromeo Enrique Henriquez Solorzano, 34.

All are from El Salvador. Turcios, Rivera-Luna and Monterrosa-Larios have been indicted in the United States on criminal charges. Rivera-Luna and Monterrosa-Larios are jailed in El Salvador and Turcios' whereabouts are unknown. Federal court records do not list attorneys of any of the three men.

Henriquez is believed to be the head of the gang's operations in El Salvador, despite being jailed in the Central American country.

The six men could not immediately be located by The Associated Press for comment.

Adam Szubin, who is the head of OFAC, said federal authorities are moving to freeze any assets the men may have in the United States, whether it be bank accounts or real property. While at least four of the six gang leaders are believed to be in prison in El Salvador, authorities believe they are still actively directing MS-13 operations and profiting from crimes including human and drug smuggling, racketeering, extortion and kidnapping.

Waldemar Rodriguez, Immigration and Customs Enforcement deputy assistant director for transnational crime and public safety, said financial penalties are part of a broader effort to halt the gang's activities in the U.S. Since 2006, about 4,200 MS-13 members have been arrested ""yet international criminal activities continue.""

""MS-13 is a rising public threat,"" Rodriguez said. ""We must take them on where ever they are.""

The gang was founded more than two decades ago by immigrants flee El Salvador's civil war. Taking lessons from the brutal conflict to the streets of Los Angeles, its founders built a reputation as one of the most ruthless and sophisticated street gangs, according to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Special Agent Jason Shatarsky.

MS-13 has a strong presence in Southern California, the District of Columbia and northern Virginia, all areas with substantial Salvadoran populations, and as many 10,000 members in 46 states. The gang is also allied with several of Mexico's warring drug cartels.

Shatarsky has said MS-13 members target residents and business owners for extortion, among other crimes. The gang is active throughout Central America and in parts of Mexico, too. Authorities in Europe have reported evidence of MS-13 expanding operations there.

Numerous killings in the U.S. have been attributed to the gang, including the 2003 slaying a pregnant Virginia teenager who had become an informant. Brenda Paz, 17, was stabbed to death and her body was left along the banks of the Shenandoah River.

Gang members have been linked to the 2007 execution style shooting deaths of three friends in a schoolyard in Newark, N.J. One victim was slashed with a machete before being shot. Six people have been charged in the case.","Gang, sanctions, multiple people"

The leader of El Salvador’s Texis Cartel, Jose Misael Cisneros Rodriguez, alias “Medio Millon” (Half a Million), allegedly silenced a witness who knew about his criminal history in the United States.

“Medio Millon” is under investigation for the murder of a man who witnessed crimes committed in the United States. Cisneros turned to a leader of the Fulton Locos Salvatrucha, imprisoned in Zacatecoluca, to kill a man who had knowledge of Cisneros’ illicit businesses.

Cisneros called “El Kabra” in the Zacatecoluca maximum security prison in early 2010, to ask him to give him the green light to move against Santos Salvador Sanchez Regalado, who had been deported to the United States and who Medio Millon had met in Massachusetts when the two men both lived there in the early 2000s. Sanchez knew too much about Cisneros’ affairs in El Salvador and in North America. Oscar Arturo Vasquez Alfaro, alias “el Kabra” o “Dragon el Fulton,” broker for the Mara Salvatrucha Programa Fulton in El Salvador, and associate of Medio Millon, was the man to help with the job.

El Kabra and his clique proved effective. On February 3, at just before four in the afternoon, Juan Jose Chavez, aged 54, identified the body of his son, Santos Salvador Chavez Regalado, aged 26, on the main street of the Barrancón neighborhood, in the Sunapa Canton, Nueva Concepción.

“The body has various entry wounds made by firearms. At the crime scene there were 9 mm shells and blood splatters…Neighbors reported hearing multiple gunshots at 10:30. The deceased was driving on a 1983 Yamaha motorbike, which was yellow with blue stripes and had plates M 52-140,” read the police report, which was added to the summary prepared by the National Civil Police’s (PNC) investigatory body in August 2010, part of the prosecutor’s investigation.

That record also contained a revelation about Cisneros Rodriguez’s past, one that has a narrow relation to the US Treasury Department’s recent decision to include Cisneros on the list of six MS-13 members mentioned as “objectives” for American law enforcement and prosecutors. A witness who spoke to the PNC in 2010 said that Medio Millon had joined a gang involved in drug trafficking in Massachusetts between the late 1990s and the end of 2000. The witness also said that Santos Chavez’s knowledge of this was one of the reasons that El Kabra’s men killed him.

“The witness indicates that there was communication between the two subjects Oscar Vasquez Alfaro (“el Dragon de Fulton”) and Jose Misael Cisneros Rodriguez (“Medio Millon”) about the homicide. The victim knew about the drug trafficking and extortion operations run by “El Dragon de Fulton” for Programa Fulton, and about the drug sales and homicides committed by “Medio Millon.” The victim knew even more about “Medio Millon’s” drug trafficking operations when the two knew each other in Massachusetts, given that at that time “Medio Millón” belonged to a gang that operated in that US state,” read the police report.

US state and federal authorities, along with Massachusetts district court records, attest that Cisneros lived in Massachusetts between 1998 and 2009. Local police records indicate that he was in Nantucket, an island 48 kilometers outside the port of Boston, in 1998, 2006, and 2009, and judicial records indicate that he was involved in civil cases in 2001 and 2002.

Although Massachusetts criminal court records do not indicate that there are currently proceedings open against Cisneros, police in Washington confirmed that he was a person of interest over the last decade in Boston in relation to multiple drug trafficking investigations.

A unique case

The attorney general’s office investigated Cisneros and 34 members of the Fulton Locos Salvatrucha (FLS) for the murder of Chavez Regalado, as well as five other people who received orders from El Kabra from inside Zacatecoluca prison in 2010. That was the year that “Medio Millón” managed to escape an operation mounted to execute the arrest warrant issued by a judge for those cases, thanks to a timely warning from a deputy police inspector, say souces in the PNC, the attorney general’s office, and US law enforcement.

Police intelligence reports on these crimes say that the majority of the victims are “members of the same gang, killed for having broken the rules. An example of this is the ‘Magaly’ case, in which a gang member asked el Kabra to greenlight the murder of another ‘homie’s’ girlfriend in retaliation for betraying him. Intergang rivalry is also a frequent cause of homicides.” Only the murder of Santos Chavez, the old acquaintance from Massachusetts, has a distinct motive, according to investigators: silencing a potential witness in cases related to the United States and drug trafficking.

The leader of the hitmen, a gang member named Pedro Quintanilla, alias “El Serio,” took advantage of the situation to recover a personal debt, says the police report. After taking the first bullets, Santos Chavez fell flat on the dusty road, a few meters from his motorbike. The gunmen arrived to finish him off. “El Serio” went through the victim’s pockets and found $200, which he later used to pay back a small drug debt he owned.

Medio Millon, in addition to asking his associate Oscar Arturo, El Kabra o “Dragon de Fulton” to organized the hit, also provided the arms, as he usually did: two AK-47s and five 9 mm pistols from Honduras.

Satyam Computer Services and its former auditor PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) have agreed to pay a combined $17.5m (£10.7m) in fines in the US after one of India's biggest corporate scandals.

Satyam, an outsourcing company, will pay $10m for falsely reporting more than $1bn in profits over five years.

The company's chairman Ramalinga Raju admitted to the fraud in 2009.

Satyam's shares were indirectly traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) as well as in India.

The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said it had fined the Indian affiliate of PwC $7.5m, describing it as the largest American penalty against a foreign firm.

The SEC said the auditor, PW India, failed to independently verify cash balances in Satyam bank accounts.

Fake invoices

Satyam created false invoices to inflate cash balances that appeared to double the value of the company's assets from 2005 to 2009, the SEC said.

This misled holders of Satyam's American Depository Shares, which were trading on the NYSE, making it seem more profitable, it added. Satyam's common shares are traded primarily on Indian exchanges.

The company did not admit or deny the allegations when settling the charges.

Former executives of Satyam and two partners from PW India are facing criminal charges in an ongoing trial in India.

It took 21 years and $656m (£415m) of fees paid to two firms of lawyers and accountants but on Thursday the files were finally closed on the banking scandal that was the Bank of Credit and Commerce International. It ranged from arms trafficking to prostitution and ended with a $20bn collapse.

Liquidators and lawyers acting for creditors to BCCI held a final meeting with victims of Britain's biggest banking scandal. About 150 creditors sat in silence at Westminster's Central Hall as liquidators from Deloitte and lawyers from Hogan Lovells explained how the battle for recoveries had taken them around the world, to ""desert warehouses"" and remote locations where ""documents were rotting in damp, humid and rat-infested rooms"". On some occasions the inspection of papers was only permitted under armed guard.

Deloitte amassed a library of 95,000 box files containing about 100m chaotically ordered documents – material that spawned a welter of litigation around the world, including the unprecedented decision, eventually aborted, to sue the Bank of England, which was responsible for bank regulation at the time of the BCCI collapse, for misfeasance in public office.

The failure of BCCI also revealed a nest of corruption, money laundering and other secretive activities. Organisations such as the CIA, Manuel Noriega and mujahideen guerrillas were linked to BCCI.

A damning report was produced by Lord Bingham in Britain, while in the US Senator John Kerry's report to the foreign relations committee delivered his verdict: ""BCCI's criminality included fraud by BCCI and BCCI customers involving billions of dollars; money laundering in Europe, Africa, Asia, and the Americas; BCCI's bribery of officials in most of those locations; support of terrorism, arms trafficking, and the sale of nuclear technologies; management of prostitution; the commission and facilitation of income tax evasion, smuggling, and illegal immigration; illicit purchases of banks and real estate; and a panoply of financial crimes limited only by the imagination of its officers and customers.""

A string of more than 60 prosecutions followed, including, in Britain, that of Abbas Gokal, a businessman with intimate ties to the bank, who received a record 14-year jail sentence.

BCCI, which at its peak had 417 offices in 73 countries, collapsed in July 1991 with liabilities estimated at close to $20bn. Adding to efforts by Deloitte and Hogan Lovells on behalf of English creditors, legal and liquidation costs for other divisions of BCCI took the total bill for lawyers and insolvency professionals to $1bn.

Angus Martin, one of three joint liquidators dealing with BCCI's UK estate, told the Central Hall meeting that the $369m bill from Deloitte represented value for money. He pointed to a recovery rate for creditors of 90p in the pound. ""I think it has been very successful. I don't think anybody in the early days thought we were going to get anywhere near that figure.""

After the meeting Martin accepted the recovery figure had been flattered greatly by the passage of time and that a pound in 1991 would have a value today of £1.76. ""Even that conservative calculation gives a figure of about 50%, which is still a good result is liquidations go."" An inflation-adjusted recovery rate is not given by Deloitte in the 78-page final report.

Many attending the meeting were elderly figures from an Asian background, reflecting the bank's deliberate decision in the 1980s to target British communities with links to India, Bangladesh and Pakistan. Almost two decades ago, many of them had been among the thousands who descended on the first creditors' meeting at Wembley Arena, a more angry affair.

At the 1994 meeting Keith Vaz MP, who had seen many Leicester East constituents caught up in the BCCI scandal, emerged as one of the loudest voices of scepticism at the huge sums of money being taken by Deloitte liquidators and their advisers. On Thursday Vaz was again in attendance. He said: ""This process has made millionaires of the liquidators. What we need is a proper inquiry into these liquidation fees. Why is this still important? It has lasted 21 years; Lehmans [the US investment bank which failed in 2008] is going to be even longer. Government seems to think it has no role in this. That's got to change.""

Martin said the liquidation process was helped by the collaborative approach to asset recoveries taken by Deloitte and counterparts responsible for liquidating BCCI operations overseas.That position is in marked contrast to the legal feuding which has characterised the early years of the Lehmans insolvency process, which in Europe is being carried out by PricewaterhouseCoopers. While Lehman was not infected with widespread criminality in the same way as BCCI, some of its investment banking activities represent a much greater challenge in terms of their complexity.",everything

Introduction
Corruption probes that began in 2014 have reached the highest levels of the Brazilian government and corporate elite, implicating President Michel Temer, former presidents, and dozens of cabinet officials and senators. Operacao Lava Jato (Operation Car Wash) and overlapping investigations have led to prison sentences for top executives and politicians, mass layoffs, and billions of dollars paid in fines.
The scandals have complicated efforts to revive the economy amid its largest downturn in more than a century. The country’s biggest corporations have faced numerous setbacks, and the fallout from the scandals helped right-wing candidate Jair Bolsonaro sweep to victory in Brazil’s 2018 presidential election on a populist, anticorruption platform. Millions of Brazilians have demonstrated in favor of the investigations, and many hope that shedding light on the scandals will end the widespread corruption that has plagued their country.
What is Lava Jato?
Federal prosecutors led by Judge Sergio Moro launched Lava Jato in March 2014, after the Finance Ministry’s intelligence unit discovered unusual bank transactions involving the state-owned oil company Petrobras. They suspected that Petrobras was accepting bribes from firms, including the construction giant Odebrecht, in exchange for contracts.
Executives from both Petrobras and Odebrecht, including the latter’s former chief executive, Marcelo Odebrecht, were sentenced to jail time. In April 2017, a U.S. federal court ordered Odebrecht to pay $2.6 billion in fines to authorities in Brazil, Switzerland, and the United States. The company had previously admitted to paying out hundreds of millions of dollars in bribes to officials in twelve countries. Facing financial losses that stem in part from the probe, the two companies have laid off more than one hundred thousand employees.

According to the public prosecutor’s office, by October 2018 Lava Jato had resulted in more than two hundred convictions for crimes including corruption, abuse of the international financial system, drug trafficking, and money laundering. More than a dozen other corporations and multiple foreign leaders have also been implicated in Lava Jato, including former Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, and former Peruvian President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski.
Another investigation, Operacao Carne Fraca (Operation Weak Flesh), was announced publicly in March 2017; it began as a result of Lava Jato and pursued allegations that employees of JBS and BRF, the world’s largest beef and poultry exporters, respectively, bribed food inspectors to approve the sale of spoiled products. In the following months, the European Union suspended its meat imports from Brazil, along with China, Egypt, Japan, Mexico, and the United States. (Some of the bans were lifted soon thereafter, but EU and U.S. restrictions remain in place.) JBS’s heads, brothers Joesley and Wesley Batista, made plea bargains with prosecutors and resigned from their positions in May; their testimonies spurred a probe into President Temer. JBS’s controlling shareholder agreed that month to pay a record $3.16 billion fine after its executives admitted to bribing 1,829 politicians a total of nearly $600 million. The Batistas were arrested in September on charges of lying to the prosecution and insider trading.
Several other corruption probes that have overlapped with Lava Jato have resulted in more than a dozen arrests. These include: Operacao Panatenaico, which concerns alleged bribes paid by construction companies in exchange for contracts to build stadiums for the World Cup Brasilia hosted in 2014; Operacao Greenfield, an investigation into alleged fraud at the pension funds of state-run companies; and Operacao Zelotes, which is looking into bribes allegedly paid by companies including JBS and Ford’s Brazilian subsidiary to tax officials to reduce their corporate liabilities.
Which current or former public officials have been investigated?
Supreme Court Justice Edson Fachin has authorized prosecutors to open investigations into hundreds of individuals named in testimony by Odebrecht employees as part of their plea deals. The list included four former presidents, eight ministers, some seventy members of the National Congress, and three governors. The most prominent politicians among those investigated include:
Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. The former president (2003–2011) was sentenced by Judge Moro in July 2017 to nine and a half years in prison for corruption and money laundering. Lula, who also faces charges in several other corruption cases, lost appeals and had his prison sentence extended to twelve years in early 2018. His loss of these appeals effectively barred him from running for political office, although his party subsequently named him as its presidential candidate in the 2018 election. Lula ended his presidential bid in September and endorsed former Sao Paulo Mayor Fernando Haddad, who lost to Bolsonaro in a runoff. The federal prosecutor’s office has referred to Lula as the mastermind behind the entire corruption scheme targeted by Lava Jato, and some officials from his administration are serving prison sentences for related crimes. He is often described as a mentor to his successor, Dilma Rousseff, who was his chief of staff from 2005 to 2010.
Dilma Rousseff. In office since 2011, President Rousseff was impeached and then removed from office in 2016, during her second term, after being charged with manipulating the federal budget to conceal the size of the country’s deficit. Prosecutors never brought charges related to the Petrobras scandal against Rousseff, though she was the company’s chairwoman from 2003 to 2010. A separate case, which was brought by the opposition, sought to annul Rousseff and Temer’s 2014 election victory over allegations of illegal campaign donations, but was unsuccessful.
Michel Temer. Rousseff’s one-time running mate and vice president took office in August 2016, after Rousseff was impeached. His name did not appear on Fachin’s list, but he has since been charged with taking bribes. JBS chair Joesley Batista handed over to investigators secretly recorded audio that purports to show Temer authorizing hush money for Eduardo Cunha, a former speaker of Congress’s lower house. Like Rousseff and Lula, Temer has denied the allegations against him.
Eduardo Cunha. Cunha was charged in October 2016 with accepting bribes worth $40 million and attempting to obstruct investigations into his activities. In March 2017, he was sentenced to more than fifteen years in prison for corruption, tax evasion, and money laundering. Cunha faces additional criminal charges as well.
Sergio Cabral. The former governor of Rio de Janeiro state was arrested in November 2016 on charges of accepting $64 million in bribes in exchange for construction contracts, including for World Cup stadiums. He was sentenced to fourteen years in prison in June 2017.
Have the probes had economic consequences?
Brazil’s economic troubles predate Lava Jato. Initially thought to be a temporary downturn in the wake of playing host to the World Cup, Brazil fell beginning in early 2014 into its worst recession in more than a century. As the political crisis worsened, investment levels and consumer confidence suffered, leading to a 3.9 percent drop in GDP in 2015 and another 3.6 percent decrease the following year.
In the first half of 2017, Brazil saw its first quarter-on-quarter growth in two years, at 1 percent. But after the Temer recording was released in May, Brazil’s currency, the real, plummeted 8 percent, and economists indicated that political turmoil would make it more likely that the country would sink back into recession. Unemployment in Brazil hit a new high in March 2017 at 13.7 percent, more than double the rate in late 2013, prior to the start of Lava Jato.
By the end of that year, though, Brazil’s economy showed initial signs of recovery. The Finance Ministry announced that GDP had grown an estimated 1.1 percent in 2017, citing a drop in private sector debt and increases in investment and consumption. Unemployment and inflation were falling and the benchmark interest rate was at an all-time low of 7 percent in December.
Temer has pressed Congress to approve a massive economic reform program that includes austerity measures meant to rein in government debt, which continues to rise. However, experts doubt that he can move forward with reforms amid corruption investigations. Multiple iterations of Temer’s pension reform bill have floundered in Congress.
Meanwhile, the companies at the center of the scandals, some of the country’s largest, have been confronted with deep financial consequences. By mid-2018, the corruption scandal was believed to have helped erase more than $250 billion from Petrobras’s market value. The oil giant has also lost billions more in legal settlements and other costs related to graft, including an $853 million settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and Brazilian authorities.
Where does the Temer administration stand?
Brazilian legislation provides sitting cabinet members and other federal elected officials with special standing; they can only be tried by the STF. Cases against politicians move slowly through the single court, which has traditionally been deferential to politicians, leading to “practical immunity from prosecution,” writes Matthew M. Taylor, an expert on Latin American politics at American University.
In June 2017, the prosecutor-general charged the president with corruption for accepting a $152,000 bribe from Batista, and in September with obstruction of justice and racketeering. The charges failed to obtain the two-thirds approval required by Congress for it to move forward in the STF, and Temer survived an impeachment vote in August of that year. Even so, at least eight cabinet ministers or top aides have stepped down since Temer took office due to the revelations from Lava Jato and other probes. “His kitchen cabinet has been decimated,” says Taylor. Several smaller political parties have withdrawn their support for the Temer administration.   
[Temer’s] kitchen cabinet has been decimated.
 Matthew M. Taylor, American University
   
In December 2017, Temer sparked outrage by reducing the minimum amount of prison time required for nonviolent criminals to be considered for an annual presidential pardon. Critics argued that the softened terms would likely benefit politicians convicted under Lava Jato down the line. The STF promptly suspended parts of Temer’s order, stating that “pardons are not and cannot become an instrument of impunity.”
Temer will vacate the presidency in January 2019. Bolsonaro has promised to crack down on rampant corruption and crime, blaming rising levels of violence on widespread graft among Brazil’s judiciary and law enforcement officials. He named Moro his minister of justice, proposed comprehensive anticorruption legislation, and supported tougher criminal sentences and the use of deadly force on suspected felons. While his supporters believe such iron-fist policies will rein in corruption and crime, many analysts fear the measures will backfire, fueling violence against the state and causing Brazil’s prison population—already a leading source of gang recruitment—to balloon.",

Mahan Airlines, operating under the name Mahan Air (Persian: هواپیمایی ماهان‎, romanized: Havâpeymâye Mâhân) is a privately owned Iranian airline based in Tehran, Iran. [3] [4] It operates scheduled domestic services and international flights to the Far East, Middle East, Central Asia and Europe. Its main home bases are Tehran Imam Khomeini International Airport and Mehrabad International Airport.

Mahan Air was established in 1991 as a Full-Service Carrier (FSC), and began operations in June 1992 as Iran's first private airline. The name of Mahan is taken from the historical city of Mahan in Kerman Province. The Airline joined the IATA in 2001 and is owned by Mol-Al-Movahedin Charity Institute (100%). [ citation needed ]

Three Airbus A300B4 passenger aircraft were acquired in 1999, and in 2002 A310s and A320s joined the fleet. According to the British High Court, three 747-400s were unlawfully taken by Mahan Air from their real owner, Blue Sky Airlines, in 2008, using forged bills of sale. When ordered to bring the aircraft back to Europe, Mahan claimed it could not do so because it was being investigated by the Iranian authorities for fraud, and the aircraft had to be kept in Iran. [5] The fleet has gone through an extensive modernization since 2006 as Boeing 747-400s, Airbus A300-600s, Avro RJ-100s, and Airbus A340-600s were gradually acquired to enable Mahan Air to provide additional capacity to its current destinations, as well as extending its reach to further destinations worldwide. The airline started operations from Tehran to Shanghai in 2011, Guangzhou in 2013 and Beijing in 2014. [ citation needed ]

The airline carried 5.4 million passengers in 2015 with an average load factor of 77%. In mid-2015 it had a fleet of 60 aircraft, making it the largest airline in Iran based on seat numbers and fleet size. It operates scheduled passenger services to international destinations in Europe, the Far East, and the Middle East. Mahan Air has an extensive domestic route network too. The airline commenced Copenhagen and Paris services in the first half of 2016. [ citation needed ]

On 12 December 2011, the U.S. Department of Treasury announced the designation of Mahan Air as a material and transportation supporter of terrorism, ""for providing financial, material and technological support to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Qods Force (IRGC-QF). Based in Tehran, Mahan Air provides transportation, funds transfers and personnel travel services to the IRGC-QF."" [6] [7] [8] [9] [10]

On 6 April 2016, Mahan Air was banned from flying over Saudi Arabian airspace. [11]

Between 2015 and 2018, Mahan Air significantly expanded its operations and fleet. Mahan Air targets the business traffic between Asia, especially China, and European destinations. In 2016, besides Germany and Denmark, Mahan Air started service to Milan and Athens; and to Barcelona the following year. It operated up to 15 weekly flights to China until late 2018. [ citation needed ]

During the Venezuelan presidential crisis, Mahan Air launched their its direct Caracas -Tehran route in April 2019. [12]

In January 2019, the German government banned Mahan Air from landing in Germany, where it formerly served Munich Airport and Düsseldorf Airport, citing Mahan's involvement in Syria and security concerns. [13] [14] France imposed the same ban on 25 March 2019, and Mahan Air was forced to cancel its 4-weekly service to Paris. [15]

On 1 November 2019, the Italian government also announced that the country would ban Mahan Air flights to the country from 15 December 2019. The move came after the United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo 's visit to Rome, during which he urged Italian officials to stop allowing Iranian airlines to use Italy's airspace. [16] The remaining destinations within the European Union had been Barcelona and seasonally also Athens and Varna since then. However, in April 2020 the airline lost its traffic rights to Spain as well. [17]

Role in the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic[ edit ]

According to the BBC, after Iran officially suspended all flights to and from China, Mahan Air continued flying to China and elsewhere in February and March. [18]

Arrival and departure data from Tehran’s Imam Khomeini and Chinese airports shows flights continued into March. [ citation needed ] A 5 February flight carried the remaining Iraqi students from Wuhan to Baghdad while a Feb. 6 flight carried 70 Iranian students back from Wuhan to Tehran. [ citation needed ]

Mahan Air claimed it had ended all flights from China after an Iranian student newspaper criticized the February 6 flight. But data from commercial flight tracker Flightradar24 showed 55 more flights from Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen, lasting until Feb. 23 (by which time Iran had 43 confirmed COVID-19 cases). The BBC investigation established that Lebanon’s first COVID-19 cases originated on Mahan Air flights. [ citation needed ]

Planes that went to Tehran from China also made onward travel within 24 hours to Barcelona, Dubai, Kuala Lumpur and Istanbul. [ citation needed ] From February 6 to March 31, a total of 37 Mahan Air flights went to Dubai, 19 flights went to Turkey, 12 went to Malaysia, 8 went to Syria, and 6 went to Thailand. Cabin crew raised concerns about their lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) and containment measures on planes but were silenced by the airline. Mahan Air claimed it was sending humanitarian aid to China and that none of the flights were passenger flights. [ citation needed ]

The data shows that although six flights were used for aid, four others were used to evacuate Iranian citizens from China, and there were a total of 157 additional flights with China from February 6 to March 31. [18] [19]

As of January 2020, Mahan Air operates scheduled service to domestic and international destinations in Asia and Africa. Mahan Air is currently not allowed to operate flights into Europe as it's been blacklisted. [22] Mahan Air is also currently banned from entering the United States, Canada, Latin America, Japan, South Korea, Israel, Cyprus, Qatar, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, and Oceania due to sanctions against Iran, as the airline was accused of bringing COVID-19 into several Middle East countries from China, supporting terrorism against the US and its allies, and transporting weapons and explosives for Venezuela, Russia, China, North Korea, Yemen, Syria, and the Iranian Revolutionary Guard and its divisions.

Incidents[ edit ]

23 February 2006: A Mahan Air Airbus A310 operating a flight from Tehran, Iran, was involved in a serious incident while on approach to Birmingham International Airport. The aircraft descended to the published minimum descent altitude of 740 ft despite still being 11 nm from the runway threshold. At a point 6 nm from the runway the aircraft had descended to an altitude of 660 ft, which was 164 ft above ground level. Having noticed the descent profile, Birmingham air traffic control issued an immediate climb instruction to the aircraft, however, the crew had already commenced a missed approach, having received a GPWS alert. The aircraft was radar vectored for a second approach during which the flight crew again initiated an early descent. On this occasion, the radar controller instructed the crew to maintain their altitude and the crew successfully completed the approach to a safe landing. The accident investigation determined that the primary cause was use of the incorrect DME for the approach, combined with a substantial breakdown in the Crew Resource Management. Three safety recommendations were made. [30]
On 23 September 2013, a Boeing 747-300 registered EP-MNE operating as Mahan Air Flight 5070 from Kerman to Medina aborted takeoff after V1 and excursed from the runway. All 443 people survived and only 13 were injured. The aircraft was repaired and returned to service, but would be lost in another accident two year later. [31]
On 13 June 2014, an Airbus A310 registered EP-MNX was struck by a passenger bus while parked at Tehran-Imam Khomeini International Airport. The aircraft was unoccupied at the time of the incident and was repaired. [32]
On 15 October 2015, the same aircraft involved in the Flight 5070 incident operating as Mahan Air Flight 1095 from Tehran to Bandar Abbas experienced an engine failure after taking off from Tehran. The aircraft returned to Tehran and made an emergency landing with no injuries to the 441 people on board reported. The aircraft was damaged beyond repair and written off in what was the first hull loss accident for Mahan Air. [33]
On 24 December 2015, Mahan Air Flight 5112, an Airbus A310 registered EP-MNP rolled off the apron at Istanbul while taxiing at Istanbul Atatürk Airport. All 166 people survived and the aircraft was repaired. [34]
On 23 July 2020, it was reported that a Mahan Air airplane, an Airbus A310-300 registered EP-MNF operating as Mahan Air Flight 1152 from Tehran to Beirut was escorted by American fighter jets over Syrian airspace. The airplane landed in Beirut with three injuries reported. [35]
On 19 June 2016, a British Aerospace BAe-146-300 registered EP-MOF operating as Mahan Air Flight 4525 from Ahwaz to Khark overran the runway after landing at Khark Airport and was substaintly damaged. All 89 people on board survived with no injuries, but the aircraft was declared a hull loss. [36]

In this Spanish name, the first or paternal family name is González and the second or maternal family name is Valencia.

Elvis González Valencia (Spanish pronunciation: ['elbiz ɣon'sales βa'lenθja]; born 12 October 1980 or 18 March 1979), commonly referred to by his alias El Elvis (Spanish pronunciation: [el 'elbiz]), is a Mexican suspected drug lord and high-ranking leader of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG) and Los Cuinis, two allied criminal groups based in Jalisco. He was reportedly responsible for managing international drug trafficking operations and money laundering schemes under his brother Abigael González Valencia (alias ""El Cuini"") and brother-in-law Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes (alias ""El Mencho"").

On 2 January 2016, González Valencia registered at a hospital in Zapopan, Jalisco, using fake identification after suffering several gunshot wounds. He was later arrested there and imprisoned at the Federal Social Readaptation Center No. 1, Mexico's maximum-security prison. He was released in December 2016 after a judge concluded that the evidence against him was insufficient.

Elvis González Valencia was born on 12 October 1980, in Aguililla, Michoacán, Mexico. [1] His parents were J. Abigael González Mendoza (father) and Estela Valencia Farías (mother). [a] [3] According to the United States Department of the Treasury, he has an alternative date of birth, 18 March 1979, and an alternative legal alias, Alejandro Tapia Castro. [1] He is commonly referred to by his alias ""El Elvis"". [4] González Valencia also had two Unique Population Registry Codes (CURP), a unique identifier of Mexican citizens and residents. [5]

According to the Mexican government, the González Valencia clan was made up of 18 siblings. [6] The males are Abigael, José María, Arnulfo, Ulises Jovani, Elvis, Édgar Edén, Mauricio, Gerardo, José and Luis Ángel. [b] The females are Rosalinda (also known as Rosalía), Noemí, Berenice, Marisa Ivette, María Elena, Érika and Abigaíl. [8] People in their hometown nicknamed the clan ""Cuinis"" in reference to a ground squirrel (Spermophilus adocetus), commonly known as ""Cuinique""; it is common for this squirrel to have litters of over a dozen kits. [3] [9]

Criminal career[ edit ]

González Valencia was suspected by Mexican security forces to be a high-ranking leader and top financial operator of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG) and Los Cuinis, two criminal groups based in Jalisco. [10] In 2015, González Valencia's rank within the organizations grew after several of his family members were arrested by Mexican security forces. In 2014–2015, his nephew Rubén Oseguera González was arrested. [c] his brother Abigael González Valencia (alias ""El Cuini"") in February 2015; and his in-law Antonio Oseguera Cervantes in December 2015. [13] [14]

Along with his siblings Gerardo, José María, Ulises Jovani, Édgar Edén, and Rosalinda, he began to make major decisions on the financial operations of the two criminal groups. They reported to Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes (alias ""El Mencho""), the top leader of the CJNG and one of Mexico's most-wanted drug lords. Oseguera Cervantes is González Valencia's brother-in-law because he is married to his sister Rosalinda. [13] According to Jalisco authorities, he was investigated for three charges: two extortion cases and a property damage charge. [15] [16] At a federal level, the Mexican government was investigating him for his alleged involvement in drug trafficking and money laundering. [10] [17] They believe that he was responsible for directing negotiations with criminal groups in the United States and South America to facilitate his criminal operations internationally. [18]

In the United States, he was sanctioned by the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act (also known as the ""Kingpin Act"") on 27 October 2016, for his alleged involvement in money laundering and/or international drug trafficking. [19] This sanction was a result of an investigation by the Treasury Department and the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) office in Los Angeles in an attempt to disrupt the inner circle of the CJNG and affect their finances in Mexico's domestic economy. This sanction was also extended to eight more individuals: Antonio, Julio Alberto Castillo Rodríguez, businessman Fabián Felipe Vera López, attorney María Teresa Quintana Navarro, and four of González Valencia's siblings: Arnulfo, Édgar Edén, Marisa Ivette, and Noemí. They were accused of providing material assistance to Nemesio and Abigael for their criminal operations. As a result, all of González Valencia's U.S.-based assets were frozen. The act also prohibited U.S. citizens from conducting business transactions with him. [20]

Early in the morning on 2 January 2016, González Valencia and his companions left San Miguel el Alto, Jalisco, after a meeting and stopped on the side road of a highway to go to the restroom. [d] [22] After they exited their vehicle, a group of gunmen shot them from a moving vehicle. [23] González Valencia was struck twice in the arm and had one bullet graze. [e] [26] He first visited a rural hospital near San Miguel el Alto to treat his gunshot wounds, but because the wounds were serious, he was taken to a private hospital in Zapopan, Jalisco. [f] [29]

At the hospital, he registered using fake identification; [30] Mexican law required the hospital was report any gunshot wound so that the incident could be investigated. In this case, authorities suspected that the victim was not who he posed to be. [31] The first officers to arrive were from the Federal Police and the Fuerza Única Jalisco, a branch of the state police. [10] They kept González Valencia under custody to fully identify him, and safeguarded the premises to prevent his attackers from injuring him again or his comrades from orchestrating his escape. [21] [25] The Mexican Army later arrived to help safeguard the area. [10]

On 3 January, the SEIDO, Mexico's anti-organized crime investigatory agency, confirmed his identity. [32] His arrest was then confirmed by Jalisco state authorities, who told the press that González Valencia was under custody in the hospital and that he was a high-ranking member of the CJNG and Los Cuinis. [21] [33] They stated that once González Valencia was healed, he would be transferred to the SEIDO headquarters in Mexico City. [34] [35] Two days later, he was transferred from Jalisco to the SEIDO installations in Mexico City. [g] [37]

On 6 January, González Valencia was placed under a 40-day preventive detention due to his alleged involvement in criminal activities. [38] The purpose of the preventive detention was to give investigators from the Federal Public Ministry more time to collect more evidences against González Valencia. [39] His wife Adriana Sánchez Reyna tried to issue a writ of amparo in favor of her husband in order to prevent his detention. [40] González Valencia was later imprisoned at the Federal Social Readaptation Center No. 1 (also known as ""Altiplano""), Mexico's maximum-security prison in Almoloya de Juárez, State of Mexico. [41]

On 23 December 2016, González Valencia's defense issued two writs of amparo to a State of Mexico court of appeals. The court struck the requests stating that they were not able to notify González Valencia because he was no longer in prison since 14 December. [42] [41] He was released because a judge considered that there was not sufficient evidence to support the charges of organized crime and illicit enrichment. [43]

Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos says he is ""outraged"" by allegations of a massive corruption network in the Colombian army.

The allegations were published by the Colombian weekly magazine Semana.

It says it has taped conversations that prove that huge amounts of money were siphoned off by corrupt army officers.

The defence budget has soared in recent years and the US continues to pay Colombia a generous annual allowance to wage war on drugs.

Some generals and other senior officers are accused of taking bribes of up to 50% of the contracts they awarded; others of diverting money that was meant to be spent at the barracks on petrol and other supplies.

The irregularities allegedly took place in 2012 and 2013.

'Full investigation'

President Santos has ordered the ministry of defence to carry out a full investigation.

""I feel outraged by the damage that this causes to the armed forces and the country,"" said Mr Santos.

He added that ""crimes of corruption"" should be investigated by civilian prosecutors - not military courts.

Two weeks ago, Semana published potentially damaging allegations involving the Colombian army.

It said that an elite military group had spied on government officials engaged in peace negotiations in Cuba with Colombia's largest rebel group, the Farc.

The army said the group had been set up legally and had not performed illicit activities.

The Russian-speaking caller refused to give a name but the threat was explicit: “Do you really feel you can walk home safely at night?”

It was 2013 and officers at the Estonian branch of Danske Bank were beginning to realise they had taken on some very unpleasant customers. After a tipoff, a member of staff had travelled to Moscow and started asking questions. The team was trying to trace the identity of people hiding behind anonymous corporate vehicles, which had opened accounts and were now using them to transfer huge sums of money. That was when its staff began to receive anonymous threats. “This bank will sink,” one caller warned.

Today, Danske is still very much in business, but its chief executive, Thomas Borgen, has resigned. He fell on his sword after a report produced by lawyers for his board, published on Wednesday, revealed the full extent of problems at the Estonian branch. It had thousands of suspicious customers, responsible for €200bn (£180bn) of transactions over a nine-year period. The realisation is dawning that what has been uncovered is probably the largest ever money-laundering scandal in history.

“Europe has a major money-laundering problem,” said anti-corruption expert Nienke Palstra, at campaign group Global Witness. “Until we see senior executives held fully accountable for criminal wrongdoing and serious fines for the banks involved, this kind of scandal will continue for decades to come.”

Regulators and law enforcement agencies are slowly beginning to respond. Britain’s National Crime Agency (NCA) has confirmed it is investigating an anonymous corporate vehicle linked to the scandal. For the moment, this is a civil, not a criminal case, which means no individuals will be prosecuted.

The US is taking an interest. The justice department, the treasury department and the Securities and Exchange Commission, which regulates US stock markets, are reportedly involved.

Denmark’s regulator, the Financial Supervisory Authority, has reopened an investigation that it had closed in May. Its first inquiry resulted in a reprimand, but no fine. Now the authority will look at whether management should face legal action. Its head, Jesper Berg, told the Financial Times: “It’s easy to understand that there’s a lot of public uproar. It’s a continuation of the financial crisis. There’s this sense of unmet consequences for the financial sector.”

Before being rewarded with the top job, Borgen had been responsible for Estonia as Danske’s head of international operations from 2009-12. The chief executive, in his resignation statement, said the report concluded he had “lived up” to his legal obligations. There are concerns, however, that the person at the helm during a catastrophic failure of the bank’s internal controls is not leaving immediately. Borgen is being retained until a replacement is found and, as part of his contract, he is entitled to collect a year’s pay.

Many questions remain unanswered. Even as the number of law enforcement agencies trying to tackle the Danske problem grows, doubts are mounting about their ability to bring prosecutions. Money laundering is a transnational crime. The Danske scandal involves 32 currencies, companies from Cyprus, the British Virgin Islands and the Seychelles. Customers of the Estonian branch have been traced to Russia, Azerbaijan and Ukraine.

One scheme run through the branch reportedly involved Azerbaijan’s ruling elite, and a $2.9bn (£2.2bn) fund used to pay European politicians and lobbyists.

“Money laundering is a globalised industry and if you operate on a domestic basis you might as well not bother,” said Tom Keatinge, the director of the centre for financial crime and security studies at the Royal United Services Institute. A former investment banker, Keatinge worked at JP Morgan for 20 years before turning his attention to combating fraud. “The borders are immaterial to you when you are structuring these transactions, whereas the borders are not immaterial for the cops who are trying to chase you.”

Last week, the European commission put forward proposals to create the EU’s first genuine cross-border anti-money laundering force. The European Banking Authority will see its relevant investigations team increased from two people to 10, and the agency is to be handed the power to intervene where it believes national regulators are failing. But its mandate is limited to taking action against banks – it cannot prosecute their criminal customers.

Neither this week’s 87-page report, produced for Danske by an independent law firm, Bruun and Hjejle, nor a 19-page memorandum by the Danish FSA outlining Danske’s failings in May, have confirmed the names of any of the bank’s suspicious clients. Five years after staff in Estonia began raising the alarm, the only revelations in this area have come from investigative reporters.

The Bruun and Hjejle report makes a glancing reference to the most eye-catching name: the Putin family. It confirms that in December 2013, a whistleblower’s account was sent to a member of Danske’s executive board. The whistleblower named a UK registered company with an account at Danske whose beneficial owners were suspected to include “the Putin family and the FSB”.

Bruun and Hjejle referenced reporting by the Danish newspaper Berlingske, which last year named Igor Putin, a businessman and cousin of the Russian president, and a number of his associates, as the individuals suspected by Danske staff of having transacted money through its Estonian accounts. Putin did not respond to a request for comment from Berlingske.

The transactions centred on a UK-registered company called Lantana Trade LLP. England’s limited liability partnerships are notoriously popular for money laundering, because the information they are obliged to disclose is minimal. Companies House lists 50,000 active LLPs.

Lantana had filed accounts claiming to be dormant, according to the Danish FSA report from May. But Danske staff noticed in the summer of 2012 that it had an extensive history of transactions and a credit balance of nearly $1m. The alarm was raised with managers, but instead of closing the account, they allowed Lantana to remain a client until September 2013.

The NCA will not name the company it is investigating. The only detail given is that it is an LLP. In a statement, the agency did acknowledge the role often played by English companies in illegal schemes. “The threat posed by the use of UK company structures as a route for money laundering is widely recognised and the NCA is working with partners across government to restrict the ability of criminals to use them in this way.”

The government says it is considering how to bolster the ability of the Companies House team to check the information provided by entities on its register. But for Keatinge, information gathering is not enough. “We know that supervision doesn’t get the bad guys,” he said. “It’s investigation that gets the bad guys.”",

Colombia’s President Ivan Duque on Monday appointed the heir of a convicted land thief and terrorism sponsor as Vice-Minister for the Promotion of Justice, further strengthening ties with organized crime.

In a tweet, Duque announced the appointment of Francisco Chaux, whose father Juan Jose Chaux was convicted to 40 years in prison for terrorism support and is additionally accused of land theft.

The president, who was elected in 2018 with the alleged help of a drug trafficking organization, has granted an increasing amount of power to family members and representatives of notorious organized crime figures.

The most delicate of appointments are those to positions related to justice, victims and land distribution, which could impede land restitution to victims of, for example Chaux’s father, or lead to a repetition of the massive land heist with government support under Uribe.

Executive branch

Francisco Chaux

Chaux’s father was intimate with Duque’s political patron, Alvaro Uribe, and multiple commanders of now-demobilized paramilitary organization AUC who used terrorism to help the politician get elected governor and dispossess large amounts of lands.

The former governor of the southwestern Cauca province had ties Medellin crime lord “ Don Berna,” and paramilitary warlords “Macaco,” “El Aleman,” Salvatore Mancuso and “HH.”

The paramilitaries helped Chaux get elected in his home province and steal land for palm oil plantations in the northwest of Colombia.

Ivan Duque

President Ivan Duque is investigated over his relationship with the late money launderer of the drug trafficking organization of Marquitos Figueroa.

The former personal assistant of Uribe conspired with Hernandez to rig the 2018 elections in favor of Duque, who the mafioso knew personally.

The election fraud scandal called “Ñeñepolitica” is not just a legal problem for Duque, but for many in his party who were wiretapped discussing vote-buying or illegal campaign donations.

Marta Lucia Ramirez

Marta Lucia Ramirez is Duque’s vice-president who found herself tied to former Medellin Cartel and AUC narco “Memo Fantasma” after an invstigation by transnational crime website InSight Crime.

The VP’s husband, Alvaro Rincon, confirmed they worked together with the former narco in the development of a real estate project in the capital Bogota, Torres 85.

Ramirez allegedly helped the narco get his kids accepted to one of Bogota’s most exclusive schools, the Nuevo Granada School, which has received donations from Memo Fantasma and his wife, Medellin socialite Catalina Mejia.

The VP has also been accused of having a conflict of interest as former contractor of Duque’s financial patron, Grupo Aval, together with Transport Minister Maria Angela Orozco.

Interior Minister Alicia Arango’s husband was one of Uribe’s presidential advisers until he was forced to step down in 2004 over his alleged involvement in the embezzlement of almost $500,000.

The Minister was Uribe’s private secretary throughout his presidency between 2002 and 2010 and became the director of his far-right Democratic Center party in 2013.

Nancy Patricia Gutierrez

Nancy Patricia Gutierrez is the presidential human rights adviser, who is being investigated over her alleged ties to paramilitary organization AUC.

Six former members of the AUC have testified that they helped her enter the Senate in the 2002 elections.

Gutierrez also played a key role in a political warfare campaign orchestrated by now-defunct intelligence agency DAS to smear one of Uribe’s critics, former Senator Piedad Cordoba.

Rodolfo Enrique Zea

Agriculture Minister Rodolfo Enrique Zea is being investigated by the Prosecutor General’s Office for allegedly seeking to funnel coronavirus emergency aid funds to people who weren’t supposed to receive them.

The Inspector General’s Office is conducting a second investigation on similar charges related to Zea’s time as Secretary General of the Territorial Development Bank (Findeter) where he worked most his professional life.

This investment bank was accused of wiring money to Micky Ramirez, a former Medellin Cartel narco, when Uribe was president.

Jorge Rodrigo Tovar

Jorge Rodrigo Tovar, the son of paramilitary war lord ‘Jorge 40,” was appointed Victims coordinator by Interior Minister Alicia Arango in May.

While Jorge 40 was among the most brutal paramilitary warlords in the 1990’s, the AUC commander’s son was not involved in these crimes and spent years working with victims without knowing the attorney is the son of one of their victimizers.

The appointment of the son of the warlord accused of 330 massacres as victims coordinator created major distrust among victims.

Andres Augusto Castro

Andres Augusto Castro is a dynasty politician who between 2009 and 2013 was the director of palm federation Fedepalma, which saw multiple members arrested while Castro represented them.

Duque appointed Castro director of the Land Restitution Unit, making the former representative of land thieves responsible for the restitution of this land.

Castro failed to mention his former position when applying for his current job, which has since raised questions about the official’s conflict of interest.

Myriam Carolina Martinez

Myriam Carolina Martinez was the director of Fedepalma between 2013 until her appointment at the National Land Agency,

The predecessor of this agency was founded by Uribe nd liquidated under former President Juan Manuel Santos because of the rampant embezzlement of land its participation in land dispossession.

Chaux’s company Urapalma, for example, was able to legalize the ownership of a palm oil plantation in 2005 after they had been expelled by paramilitaries commander by AUC founder Carlos Castaño.

Party leaders

Alvaro Uribe

Democratic Center leader Alvaro Uribe is an admitted former associate of the Medellin Cartel and an alleged founder of the Bloque Metro paramilitary group.

The earlier evidence of Uribe’s involvement in drug trafficking date back to the late 1970’s when he was in business with Fabio Ochoa, one of the founders of the Medellin Cartel.

The Cartel really kicked off after the former president was appointed director of the Civil Aviation Agency and granded some 200 licenses for airplanes and airstrips to the cartel.

Uribe’s late brother had two children with Medellin Cartel drug trafficker Dolly Cifuentes, whose brother Alex became “El Chapo’s” right-hand man until his arrest in 2013. Uribe’s niece is currently wanted for money laundering for the Sinaloa Cartel.

Fabio Valencia

Fabio Valencia is a senior member of the Democratic Center, whose brother was convicted for having ties to paramilitary group AGC when Valencia was Justice Minister.

The CD chief has long been accused of having had ties with paramilitary drug trafficker Ramon Isazza, but has always denied this..

Luis Alfredo Ramos

Luis Alfredo Ramos is Duque’s former debate chief who is awaiting verdict over his alleged ties to paramilitary organization AUC and drug trafficker “El Tuso,” who have said to have financed the former Conservative Party mogul’s election campauigns since 1998.

Nubia Stella Martinez

Party director Nubio Stella Martinez is under investigation for allegedly receiving illegal campaign funds for Duque’s 2018 campaign from a Venezuelan businessman.

The prosecution opened the investigation after the Supreme Court surrendered wiretaps in which Martinez said she had received $300,000 from “the Venezuelan,” which turned out to be oil tycoon Oswaldo Cisneros, who said a Colombian subsidiary made this contribution legally.

Lawmakers

Paola Holguin

The father of Senator Paola Holguin, Frank Holguin, was a frontman of the Medellin Cartel who was left with a large number of real estate properties after the death of Pablo Escobar. Her late uncle Juan Fernando reportedly was an assassin who initially worked for the Medellin Cartel and later joined “Don Berna” after he took control of the Oficina de Envigado.

Fernando Araujo

Fernando Araujo is the son of former foreign minister Fernando Araujo and the nephew of convicted politician Alvaro Araujo who maintained ties between paramilitary organization AUC and US multinational Drummond.

Maria Fernanda Cabal

Senator Maria Fernanda Cabal is under investigation for allegedly intimidating and extorting school teachers in Bogota into voting for her. Cabal’s husband, alleged terrorism supporter Jose Felix Ladauri, received hundreds of thousands of dollars despite suspicions of corruption or mismanagement.

The 1960s found 17-year-old Richard Scrushy pumping gas in Selma, Alabama, thinking of better opportunities. With his then-wife pregnant, Scrushy found his first real job working alongside his mother as a respiratory technician. 5 After graduating from the University of Alabama, Scrushy was hired at an entry-level position at Lifemark Corp, a Houston-based health-care company. 5 He worked his way up the ladder and, in no time, was running the company’s pharmacy, physical rehab, and merger departments. 5 In 1984, Scrushy received a $1 million loan from Citicorp Venture Capital to start his own company, HealthSouth, Inc. 5 HealthSouth, the first national chain of orthopedic hospitals and outpatient centers, quickly became one of United States’ largest owners and operators of inpatient rehabilitative hospitals. 1,5 By 1996, when Scrushy took his company public, HealthSouth had a massive market value of over $12 billion. 2 However, in retrospect, HealthSouth’s growth, market value, and financial statement values were not nearly what they appeared to be, as HealthSouth executives had perpetrated an upwards of $2.7 billion of accounting fraud. 3

The HealthSouth fraud occurred during an interesting period of economic growth and lackadaisical regulations, which made committing accounting fraud much easier. The 1990s saw investors and lenders who were less focused on profitability and more so on revenue. 4 When looking for capital as a company, growth was key. This pressured CEOs, like Scrushy, to continue growing their companies and meeting analyst expectations quarter after quarter. Combined with this increased pressure of growth was an environment of strange legalism. 4 If accounting procedures and policies did not directly violate Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), then they were considered legal, and in turn, morally and ethically adequate. 4 This allowed Scrushy and HealthSouth to meet analyst expectations for 40 consecutive quarters, using creative accounting methods and ultimately fraudulent accounting. Driven by this thirst to hit analyst expectations, Scrushy and HealthSouth’s “financial family” (Scrushy and five HealthSouth CFOs) altered their earnings numbers; explained as: plugging “holes” in the balance sheet with “dirt.” 1 The fraud, which included improperly capitalizing expenses, overestimating insurance reimbursements, overvaluing fixed assets, and using faulty reserve accountings, went undetected until 2003, when former HealthSouth CFO, Weston Smith, revealed the fraud to federal investigators. 1 Despite seemingly being the obvious mastermind behind HealthSouth’s accounting fraud, Scrushy denied (and still denies to this day) that he was involved in any way. 5 Scrushy claimed that the other executives took part in the fraud, and kept it hidden from him completely. 5 Despite his expressed innocence, Scrushy was convinced for accounting fraud and served a five-year sentence. 5

Business Model

Upon the founding of HealthSouth, Scrushy saw healthcare as a no-lose business under the premise that large government reimbursements would continue to grow and to always be available to hospitals operators. 5 Scrushy saw two trends occurring in the United States: injuries to feet, knees, and hips were becoming more frequent as the population grew older, and more people were exercising later into life. 5 This lead to a large percentage of HealthSouth pateints being eligible for Medicare, and because government was in fact giving large health-care subsidies to hospitals, Scrushy used this financing to engage in aggressive acquisition of competing companies, with the plan of receiving more and more of the government’s money. 5 His strategy, initially, worked flawlessly, with HealthSouth posting yearly double-digit profit increased and stock growth of 31% per year on average between 1987 and 1997. 5 Scrushy was able to use HealthSouth stock as currency to further expand on his core business of rehabilitation, moving into outpatient surgery, occupational medicine, and hospital sectors. 5

However, in 1997 government cut Medicare reimbursements to hospitals, which took a huge toll on HealthSouth’s margins. 5 With Medicare at the time accounting for 37% of HealthSouth’s revenues, HealthSouth’s business immediately felt the effects of the subsidy cuts. 5 With HealthSouth no longer able to grow via acquisition, many of its flaws in operations began to show. Scrushy tried to keep his company profitable off operations alone by upping the amount of patients at each of his facilities, but HealthSouth still took an 86% hit to net income in 1998. 5 Yet HealthSouth “magically” found new life over the next few years. Although sales only grew by 5% from 1999 to 2001, HealthSouth’s net income inconceivably rose almost 500%. 1 At the time, Scrushy explained this rebound occurred from lowering costs while raising revenues through increased efficiency in each hospital, but we now know that these magical earnings numbers were magical for a reason: because they were almost completely fictitious.

Accounting Fraud

How did HealthSouth get away with a fraud so big for so long? Their executives followed three basic steps while committing the fraud: 1) Company officials compared their internal financial statements to see if they would meet analyst expectations. 2) If earnings appeared to be short, managers were told to fix them and manipulate the results in any way necessary. 3) False documents were created to conceal the false entries added to the financial statements. 4 HealthSouth’s executive “family” happened to be made up of many former Ernst & Young (E&Y) auditors, which was the public assurance firm auditing HealthSouth, and thus were especially well-positioned to keep the fraud from the public by deceiving the audit engagement team. 1 For example, management knew that E&Y’s materiality threshold for examining fixed-asset additions was $5,000. 1,4 This meant that as long as HealthSouth employees only moved amounts of money less than $5,000 at a time, the fictitious transactions would not be picked up in E&Y’s auditing procedures. 1 However, this required a massive amount of work. With an average fictitious journal entry of $2,500, in order to overstate income by $2.7 billion, it would take over one million separate transactions. Not only did HealthSouth employees have to create each individual journal entry, false documentation and fixed-asset ledgers were created to show auditors in order to further conceal the fraud. 1 The volume of work that was required to pull off this fraud displays just how widespread the knowledge and participation of the fraud was throughout HealthSouth. 4 HealthSouth employees went above and beyond to conceal the fictitious entries from the auditors, which was what allowed the fraud to exist for so long.

The organizational culture at HealthSouth also played a huge role in allowing the fraud to take place for such a long period of time. Scrushy was clearly a CEO with an overbearing presence at the top of his company. In their preliminary audit work papers, E&Y noted about HealthSouth that: “management is dominated by one or a few individuals without effective oversight by the board of directors or audit committee, management displays a cavalier attitude toward, and inadequate monitoring of, significant business risks,” and “management has excessive interest in maintaining or increasing the client’s stock price or earnings trend.” 1 These qualities of management all combine to create an environment at the top that is obsessed with earnings and that has the power over their employees to allow a fraud of this size to occur. Scrushy had complete control over his company; even going as far as to have security cameras installed throughout headquarters to keep watch on his employees. 3

As in most cases of fraud, greed also was a significant motive for HealthSouth management to inflate earnings. By manipulating earnings and stock price, Scrushy was able to secure stock options for himself on the lowest trading day of HealthSouth stock, netting him the highest profit possible.

Both Scrushy and Michael Martin, HealthSouth’s treasurer and CFO for three years, engaged in large stock sales which provided them with plenty of motive to raise the company’s stock price. 3 In 1997, Martin sold $3 million worth of HealthSouth shares while Scrusy sold a hefty $100 million. 3 While testifying in regards to this sale, Martin stated, “Even though we knew we were committing fraud, we felt it was important to keep the stock price up for at least a year.” 3 HealthSouth executives were also very closely knit, which reinforced group loyalty over that of the general public. 3 HealthSouth’s executive “family” found it much easier to deceive and hurt a nameless mass of investors than the other members of their internal group. 3 Scrushy exploited the psychological desire to help those you know over those you do not. For example, he told one of his CFOs: “if you want to go public with all this, get ready to get fired, and everyone goes down with you.” 3 This created a culture at the top of HealthSouth where every executive was pressured to keep quiet for fear of bringing down their close colleagues with them.

There were also characteristics of HealthSouth on the structural level which allowed for the accounting fraud to occur. Proper checks and balances were not in place at HealthSouth, with Scrushy making a large amount of the company’s decisions on his own. For example, HealthSouth’s accounting systems did not sync properly with the corporate enterprise-resource-planning software. 3 This meant that results had to be consolidated by hand by executives, and allowed for an easy way to manipulate earnings figures. 3 The internal audit committee was also sneakily kept from doing their duties, and E&Y noted that “the internal audit-function was understaffed, undertrained, and lacking in independence.” 3

Fraud Discovery

While the fraud was occurring at HealthSouth, there were multiple warnings from outside sources to auditors that should have tipped them off to the fraud’s existence. Michael Vines was a bookkeeper at HealthSouth who oversaw the purchase of equipment. 4 After his warnings to several members of management went unnoticed, Mr. Vines left his position at HealthSouth for another job. 4 Upon leaving HealthSouth, Mr. Vines sent a letter to the E&Y auditors which read:

“I know that HealthSouth based out of Birmingham, AL has severe problems in the Accounting Department. In December 2001, HealthSouth moved expenses to capital accounts. The following accounts need to be look at as of 12-31-2001: 7000, 7200 and 7995.” 1

Mr. Vines identified three specific accounts for the auditors to look at to discover the fraud. However, instead of investigating the e-mail on their own, E&Y called the CFO of HealthSouth who claimed Mr. Vines was just a disgruntled employee and he was making his allegations up. 4 The auditors believed this explanation and never looked into the accounts Mr. Vines identified.

E&Y also received an e-mail from “Fleeced Shareholders” expressing concern about fraud within HealthSouth. The e-mail read:

“You bring the smoke, I’ll bring the mirrors. At least the market has shown the wisdom to devalue HS stock. Wish I got out in time. I have a list of questions, which I hope might interest you.

How can the HS outpatient clinics treat patients without precertification, book the revenue, and carry it after being denied payment?

How can the company carry tens of millions of dollars in accounts receivable that are well over 360 days?

How can some hospitals have NO bad debt reserves?
How did the E&Y auditors in Alabama miss this stuff?

Are these clever tricks to pump up the numbers, or something that a novice accountant could catch?
You people have I have been hoodwinked. This note is all that I can do about it. You all can do much more, if all you do is look into it to see if what I say is true.” 1

Despite these multiple, specific warnings about the fraud at HealthSouth, E&Y still failed to bring the fraud to light. It took a former HealthSouth CFO to come forward with information for the fraud to be discovered. In 2003, Weston Smith, a former CFO, tipped off federal investigators to the HealthSouth fraud. 1 Soon after, many other employees who had participated in the fraud turned themselves in as well. 1

Ethical Implications

Had any of the HealthSouth executives been acting under any sort of ethical framework, it is hard to believe that this level of fraud would have occurred within the company. The deontological framework requires decisions to be made based on what is “right” in a broad sense, valuing principals such as honesty, promise keeping, fairness, loyalty, justice, and respect for others. 7 HealthSouth executives clearly held none of these values in high regard. Anytime a corporate fraud is committed, there needs to be a disregard for moral values in favor of wealth and greed. While some of the employees involved may have succumbed to intense pressure from Scrushy or justified their actions by thinking it would only be a one-time occurrence, it is clear that Scrusy and a majority of his executive family were well-aware of the wrong-doing they were participating in.

It is also easy to see the ethical implications of the HealthSouth fraud when looking at it through a Utilitarian framework. Utilitarianism states that an ethical decision should maximize benefits to society and minimize harms. 7 The HealthSouth accounting fraud did just the opposite. HealthSouth executives put their own wealth and well-being before the rights of their shareholders and creditors to have legitimate and trustworthy company financial data. Scrushy kept his entire executive team close and exploited the psychological desire to help those you know over those you do not.

The E&Y auditors on the HealthSouth account also failed to provide the public with independently qualified financial statements. Although it can be argued that HealthSouth was exceptionally skilled in deceiving the audit team, there were many instances and red flags that should have led the auditors to discover the fraud. The audit team did not thoroughly consider the ethical implications of their negligence on the public, and overlooked an enormous, long-lasting accounting fraud that was right under their noses.

Once the accounting scandal went public, HealthSouth’s share price tanked to as low as $0.35 a share, costing their shareholders millions. Lawsuits were filed by shareholders against HealthSouth, Scrushy, and E&Y. Although found not guilty on criminal charges, Scrushy paid $81 million to the SEC to settle civil charges related to the fraud and in 2009 as rule to owe almost $3 billion to shareholders in a class action lawsuit. 1 E&Y also settled the shareholders’ class action lawsuit for $109 million, reaffirming their gross negligence in their audit of HealthSouth. 1

Many lessons can be learned from the accounting scandal at HealthSouth. Accounting scandals of this scale do not just occur on their own; they require multiple people to orchestrate. When the tone at the top of a company deviates away from any sort of ethical framework, it should be a red flag to other members of the company, to auditors, and to the public that fraud is more likely to occur. Had Scrushy or any of his CFOs thoroughly thought about the long-term implications and consequences for themselves, their company, and the public, the HealthSouth fraud may never have occurred. Although it is easy to get caught in the pressure of corporate fraud, one cannot let themselves blindly follow a CEO and be ethically deficient in their actions. As Scrushy himself said, “The CEO is just a human; the mind can only absorb so much.” 5

According to the authorities, the settlement is related to the bank’s “conduct in packaging, securitization, marketing and sale of residential mortgage-backed securities between 2005 and 2007.”

“This resolution holds Goldman Sachs accountable for its serious misconduct in falsely assuring investors that securities it sold were backed by sound mortgages, when it knew that they were full of mortgages that were likely to fail,” said Acting Associate Attorney Stuart Delery. He added that the settlement includes a $1.8 billion commitment to help repair the damage to homeowners and communities that Goldman acknowledges resulted from its conduct. The fine also includes a $2.385 billion civil penalty and $875 million in cash payments.

“We are pleased to put these legacy matters behind us. Since the financial crisis, we have taken significant steps to strengthen our culture, reinforce our commitment to our clients and ensure our governance processes are robust, ” said a statement from Goldman Sachs.

Goldman is the last major American bank to settle with the government. In January, the bank disclosed that it had agreed a payment to settle “actual and potential civil claims” by the US Justice Department and the attorney generals of New York and Illinois, as well as state regulators. Goldman then said it had set aside funds for many of the charges. The bank has already paid $3 billion to the Federal Housing Finance Agency.

Australia's Westpac bank has negotiated to pay a record A$1.3bn (£0.7bn; $0.9bn) fine for the nation's biggest breach of money laundering laws.

Last year, Australia's financial crime watchdog said the bank had failed to adequately report over 19 million international transactions.

Some payments were potentially linked to child exploitation, officials said.

The nation's second-biggest lender has apologised for its ""failings"".

Westpac is the second top Australian bank to pay huge fines for breaching anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing laws.

If the billion-dollar fine is approved by a court, it will be the largest civil penalty in Australian corporate history.

However, the fine could have been larger. The Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (Austrac) said the transactions had amounted to 23 million law breaches, with each carrying a maximum penalty of A$21m.

Concerns about child exploitation came after Austrac identified payments made to suspected operators in the Phillipines. Australian media has since linked the bank to individual cases, including an alleged paedophile's suspected use of Westpac's transfer system to pay for child sex overseas.

""The notion that any child has been hurt as a result of any failings by Westpac is deeply distressing and we are truly sorry,"" said former chairman Lindsay Maxsted last year.

He and Westpac's former chief executive left their positions last year over the scandal.

""We are committed to fixing the issues to ensure that these mistakes do not happen again,"" said chief executive Peter King in a statement on Thursday.

Westpac self-reported some of the breaches to the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (Austrac) last year. It also disclosed the investigation to shareholders, including a forecast penalty.

The bank said on Thursday it had reached an agreement to settle the court case waged by Austrac.

Most of the breaches concerned the bank's failure to report international transfers to the regulator, as required by law, in a timely fashion.

This amounted to more than A$11bn between 2013 and 2019, Austrac said.

It said the bank also failed to retain records and carry out due diligence checks with potentially high-risk overseas banks.

Austrac said there were also a small number of payments on accounts that were potentially linked to ""child exploitation risks"".

""The failure to pass on information... undermines the integrity of Australia's financial system and hinders Austrac's ability to track down the origins of financial transactions, when required to support police investigations,"" said the regulator's boss Nicole Rose last year.

The cases comes amid several investigations around the world into top banks for their alleged failures to prevent money laundering.

HSBC, Danske Bank and Rabobank have all been involved in high-profile scandals.

TMML2024037765248,Institute for Returning to the People What Was Stolen,"Alert ID: TMML2024037765248
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Three months after taking charge of a new office created by President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador to compensate Mexicans for years of public sector embezzlement, its director quit, complaining the organization was tainted by corruption.

The blow to the Institute for Returning to the People What Was Stolen (INDEP) is one of several recent cases to blot Lopez Obrador’s image and undercut the message that his December 2018 investiture marked a sea change for a country awash in graft.

On Sept. 22, INDEP director Jaime Cardenas submitted his letter of resignation, raising concerns over alleged misuse of proceeds from auctions of stolen assets, and the suspected theft of diamonds, emeralds and sapphires from the institute.

To critics, the exit of his ally Cardenas is a symbol of Lopez Obrador’s failure to deliver on his anti-corruption pledge.

“Lopez Obrador’s anti-corruption drive is much ado about nothing,” said Emilio Alvarez Icaza, an independent opposition senator. “It’s a great story, and a poor reality.”

Downplaying news which could embarrass him, Lopez Obrador routinely dismisses criticism as sour grapes from corrupt opponents, and points to landmark legislation he has passed that strips public servants of prosecutorial immunity.

Opinion polls show he has made up ground he lost early in the coronavirus pandemic, lifted by his anti-corruption drive.

Some give him an approval rating of over 60% as he gears up for national, state and municipal elections next June that will determine whether he can keep control of Congress.

Under Lopez Obrador, Mexico has moved up eight places in Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index to rank 130 out of 198 countries. Still, in 2019, the number of Mexicans who personally experienced public sector corruption rose 7%, according to the national statistics agency.

Cynicism over politicians is deeply entrenched in Mexico, where an old joke still makes the rounds that Alvaro Obregon, who ruled from 1920-1924, was the country’s least corrupt president because he only had one arm with which to steal.

‘NOT ENOUGH’

Scandals have also embroiled the families of some of Lopez Obrador’s closest allies, including the son of a veteran politician who heads the state-run electricity company.

The son, who denies wrongdoing, was in July barred from doing business with the government for overcharging state health authorities for ventilators to battle COVID-19.

In August, videos surfaced of a brother of the president receiving cash in 2015 from a political operator who later won a post in Lopez Obrador’s administration.

Then, in September, a sister-in-law of Lopez Obrador, along with other local officials, resigned from the city hall of his hometown of Macuspana in Tabasco state amid what the opposition allege is a multimillion-dollar embezzlement scandal.

“If the president thinks it’s enough for him to be honest to end corruption, that’s wrong,” said Eduardo Bohorquez, director of the Mexican arm of Transparency International.

In each case, Lopez Obrador, who promised to show family and friends no quarter over corruption, said the revelations had been exploited by hostile media and adversaries to hurt him.

On INDEP, Lopez Obrador vowed to look into any complaints. But he called the resignation of Cardenas a political matter, and said there was “nothing to worry about.”

He vowed to have the footage of his brother Pio investigated, though no formal proceedings have begun. The cash handovers, Lopez Obrador said, were “contributions” to his political cause and not comparable with previous corruption.

No proceedings have been brought against his sister-in-law Concepcion Falcon, who cited the “ungovernability” of Macuspana in quitting with her fellow councillors. Lopez Obrador verbally attacked the newspaper, Reforma, which publicized the case.

Lopez Obrador argues that high-profile prosecutions of ex-officials for corruption show he is “moralizing” public life.

One such prosecution involves Rosario Robles, a former ally accused of misuse of public funds in the last government. Another centers on a former head of state oil firm Pemex, Emilio Lozoya. Robles denies wrongdoing. Lozoya struck a plea bargain and accused his bosses of ordering him to channel bribes to politicians.

Lozoya’s revelations have kept the spotlight on alleged past misdeeds by top officials and encouraged Lopez Obrador to press for a public vote on putting his predecessors on trial.

Despite concerns that such a referendum risks politicizing the normal passage of justice given that former presidents can already face prosecution, the Supreme Court this month declared it to be constitutional.

Lopez Obrador wants the referendum held the day of June’s mid-term elections. Even if that is not possible, his agitation over the issue may prove significant.

“Keeping the corruption issue alive is politically beneficial for him,” said Carlos Petersen, an analyst at the Eurasia Group, a consultancy. “Lopez Obrador will use (the referendum) to score points before the 2021 elections.”",corruption criticism

Company lawyers filed a request with the bankruptcy court in Sao Paulo to negotiate debts of more than $20 billion dollars, officials quoted by Brazilian media said.

The demand makes it the biggest debt protection process in Brazilian history, exceeding that of telecom provider Oi in 2016.

The procedure allows Odebrecht to maintain its business activities while giving it six months to settle with its creditors.

Among the major creditors of Odebrecht are the public banks Banco Nacional de Desarrollo, Banco de Brasil and Caixa Economica Federal.

EN NW PKG BRAZIL ODEBRECHT CORRUPTION

The request for bankruptcy protection was precipitated by the suspension of the sale of the group's interest in Braskem -- a joint petrochemical company formed with Petrobras -- to Dutch firm LyondellBasell, and the May filing for bankruptcy protection by Odebrecht Atvos, the second-largest ethanol producer in the country.

Odebrecht, which is currently in the process of selling assets to limit its debt, has thus found itself in an even more precarious position vis-a-vis its creditors.

Founded in 1944, Odebrecht S.A. has long been one of Brazil 's economic giants, building everything from the Miami Heat basketball arena to a hydroelectric dam in Angola.

Major corruption scandal

Often described as a construction company, Odebrecht has also been a major player in engineering, agriculture and petrochemical production.

But now, Odebrecht is at the centre of Latin America's biggest corruption scandal that has rocked governments and political parties in Brazil, Peru, Colombia and other countries, sending former presidents and senior officials to jail.

Once one of the most influential people in Brazil, company chief Marcelo Odebrecht was sentenced to 19 years in prison for his role in the scandal -- although he is now serving a reduced sentence in his luxurious Sao Paulo mansion.

Dozens of politicians have become embroiled in the affair, including former Brazil presidents Michel Temer and Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who is serving a 12-year jail sentence for accepting bribes from the company.

Peru is the other country hardest-hit by the scandal: Odebrecht has admitted paying at least $29 million in bribes to Peruvian officials since 2004.

Officials in Ecuador, Venezuela, Panama and the Dominican Republic have also been tainted.

According to the US Justice Department, Odebrecht paid $788 million in bribes across 12 countries, with presidents as well as former heads of state and ministers involved.

In 2018, the construction giant agreed to pay a $700 million settlement to the Brazilian government as part of a $2.6 billion package it has committed to shell out to the United States, Switzerland and Brazil.",

HSBC’s Swiss private banking arm has agreed to pay nearly $336m to settle a tax fraud case in Belgium, prosecutors said on Tuesday, in the latest blow dealt by the European Union to the Alpine state’s banking sector.

HSBC, Europe’s largest bank, was “charged by a prosecutor in 2014 for serious and organised tax fraud, forgery and falsification of records, money-laundering and illegal use of financial intermediaries”, said prosecutors.

They alleged that HSBC helped and encouraged the avoidance of the EU savings tax by creating offshore companies in Panama and other tax havens in the Caribbean for wealthy Belgian clients “with no other purpose but to hide money”.

A spokesman for HSBC declined to comment. But it has already not been a good week for the bank, which announced 4,000 job losses and parted ways with CEO John Flint on Monday.

Overhaul

The bank has now made and committed to a significant overhaul of its practices to counter financial crime risks following the Belgian allegations, prosecutors said.

European governments have stepped up their pressure on banks and tax havens in recent years after a string of media revelations – including of the disclosure of the Panama Papers, exposed tax avoidance and evasion schemes that helped the wealthy to avoid paying taxes in the bloc.

The Belgian prosecutors said that under the settlement, which still needs to be endorsed by Belgian judges, HSBC agreed to pay $330m to the Belgian state for losses in tax revenues caused by the alleged illegal activities carried out by the bank since 2013.

The prosecutors estimated that money transferred to these financial vehicles could amount to several billions of dollars.

More than a thousand Belgian taxpayers could have used HSBC’s illegal schemes, which mostly served clients active in the Antwerp diamond business, prosecutors said.

In addition to the tax fraud, the prosecutors’ statement said part of the illegal transfers could have involved money laundering.

The settlement comes after a French court in February ordered UBS, another Swiss lender, to pay $5bn in penalties for illegally soliciting clients and laundering the proceeds of tax evasion. UBS, which is under investigation in Belgium for a similar case, denies the charges.

Swiss banks have been exposed to such legal challenges since 2004, when Bern agreed to apply an EU tax on the savings income of its lenders’ EU clients.","money laundering, tax evasion"

The U.S. Secret Service have arrested five individuals and seized multiple bank accounts related to a $6 billion money laundering scheme being described by authorities as “staggering” and the largest ever case of international money-laundering.

In a statement, Secret Service officials said authorities in Spain, Costa Rica and New York arrested five people on Friday and seized bank accounts and Internet domains associated with the company Liberty Reserve – a Costa Rica-based website that deals in digital currency and allows transnational online payments and money transfers.

Digital currency is a form of online currency made up of transferable units that can be exchanged with cash, and has exploded in popularity in the last decade with the increasing use of Bitcoin, the most widely used form of digital currency. Liberty Reserve’s currency was not connected with Bitcoin.

Charging a low one percent fee on transactions, Liberty Reserve allowed users to open accounts using fictitious names, including ""Russian Hacker"" and ""Hacker Account,"" and to redeem the currency for cash in any part of the world using the third-party exchange companies.

Aditya Sood, a computer science doctoral candidate at Michigan State University who has studied the underground economy, described Liberty Reserve as a no-questions-asked alternative to the global banking system, with little more than a valid email needed to open an account and start moving money across borders.

""You don't need to provide your full details, or personal information, or things like that,"" Sood said in a telephone interview with the Associated Press. ""There's no way to trace an account. That's the beauty of the system.""

Arthur Budovsky, the founder of Liberty Reserve, was one of the individuals arrested, while a defendant identified as Budovsky’s partner, Vladimir Kats, was in custody in New York.

According to the statement from the Secret Service, Liberty Reserve had approximately one million users worldwide with more than 200,000 users in the United States. Overall, the company processed an estimated 55 million separate financial transactions and is believed to have laundered more than $6 billion in criminal proceeds.

""The scope of the defendants' unlawful conduct is staggering,"" said an indictment unsealed in federal court in Manhattan.

The indictment described the network as ""one of the principal means by which cyber criminals around the world distribute, store and launder proceeds of their illegal activity ... including credit card fraud, identity theft, investment fraud, computer hacking, child pornography and narcotics trafficking.""

“The U.S. Secret Service, in coordination with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) and the Global Illicit Financial Team (GIFT) hosted by IRS-Criminal Investigations (IRS-CI) executed and arrested search warrants in seven countries that also include Spain and the Netherlands. Assets of Liberty Reserve will also be frozen in Hong Kong, Spain, Morocco and China,” the Secret Service statement said.

According to the press release, current and former executives of Liberty Reserve have also been charged with violating numerous anti money laundering statutes and operating as illegal money transmitters.

Budovsky and Katz have previous convictions on charges related to an unlicensed money-transmitting business, according to court papers. After that case, the pair decided to move their operation to Costa Rica, where Budovsky officially renounced his U.S. citizenship, the papers say.

In an online chat captured by law enforcement, Katz admitted Liberty Reserve was ""illegal"" and noted that authorities in the United States knew it was ""a money laundering operation that hackers use.""

Mitchell Rossetti, whose Houston, Texas-based ePayCards.com was one of several mainstream merchants that accepted the online-only currency, said his business still had about $28,000 tied up in Liberty Reserve accounts.

""The irony of this is I went to them because of the security,"" Rossetti said. ""All sales were final.""",

The federal agency tasked with distributing funds obtained via the sale of assets seized from organized crime and tax cheats is plagued by corruption, according to its outgoing chief.

In his resignation letter to President López Obrador, Jaime Cárdenas of the Institute to Return Stolen Goods to the People (Indep) said that when he took over as director a range of “probable administrative irregularities” were detected.

Cárdenas, who has led Indep for about 100 days and will step down on September 30, said officials stole jewelry in the agency’s possession and manipulated the auctions it held.

Indep, an agency created by the López Obrador administration and one that has been held up as a beacon of honesty, has held several auctions to sell off assets the government has seized from organized crime. Assets that have been sold include jewelry, luxury vehicles and properties.

Cárdenas also said that officials were found to have engaged in other improper conduct including the “mutilation of jewelry” and the drawing up of contracts that were unduly favorable to companies with which Indep had dealings.

With regard to the theft of jewelry, the Indep chief said that criminal complaints have been filed with the Attorney General’s Office (FGR).

He said that Indep legal officials are analyzing the possibility of filing complaints against those who allegedly manipulated auctions “in favor of a few people.”

The outgoing director also said that a review of Indep’s IT systems with the aim of “eradicating manipulation” in future online auctions has been completed.

Cárdenas, also an academic at the National Autonomous University’s Institute of Legal Research and a longtime supporter of López Obrador, said that 2 billion pesos transferred to Indep to pay the prizes in the “presidential plane” raffle has not yet been reconciled.

“These resources are invested, they generate interest but they haven’t been used,” he said without clarifying when the money will be withdrawn to pay prizes to the winners of the raffle, which was drawn last week.

On a positive note, Cárdenas outlined Indep’s achievements since he became its director.

Among them: transferring millions of pesos to two indigenous municipalities in Oaxaca and Guerrero; providing financial support to the government-affiliated, non-profit publishing group Fondo de Cultura Ecónomica; providing funds to the Ministry of Culture to purchase musical instruments for children’s bands in Oaxaca; and allocating almost 180 million pesos to Insabi, the agency tasked with managing the government’s universal healthcare scheme.

Cárdenas also said that Indep under his leadership approved the transfer of more than 200 million pesos to the Ministry of Communications and Transportation for the construction of highways and that a further 500 million pesos will go to Insabi when the funds are available.

All told Indep approved the transfer of more than 3.7 billion pesos (US $167.4 million) to indigenous communities, the health system, cultural institutions, athletes and infrastructure projects.

Cárdenas wrote that Indep has a “significant but not endless” chest of resources as well as “serious challenges,” noting that it has debts to suppliers and lacks the liquidity it requires to pay settlements to former government railway and electricity workers.

Despite the corruption at Indep and the other problems it faces, the outgoing director said that he was leaving the federal government with a heavy heart.

“I deeply regret not accompanying … the project of transformation you are leading,” Cárdenas wrote in the opening to his resignation letter to the president. “I always wish the best for you and the country,” his letter concluded.

Cárdenas, who has previously served as a lawmaker in Mexico City and a lawyer and legal adviser for López Obrador when he was a presidential candidate, will be replaced as Indep chief by Ernesto Prieto, the former director of the National Lottery.",corruption

It is clear that Danske Bank has failed to live up to its responsibility in the case of possible money laundering in Estonia.

So said Thomas Borgen, CEO of Denmark’s biggest financial institution, when he resigned after admitting that around €200 billion of questionable money flowed through the Danish bank’s Estonian branch from 2007-15.

To put that figure into some perspective, the GDP of Estonia in 2017 was €29 billion and the figure in question is approaching two thirds of the GDP of Denmark itself at €324 billion.

It raises serious questions over the capacity of banks – and governments – to combat the serious scourge of money laundering. The European Commission has called the case the “biggest scandal in Europe” and Danske Bank and Denmark and Estonia’s financial watchdogs face an inquiry from the European Union’s banking supervisor to see whether they broke the law.

Money laundering facilitates crime, undermines financial systems and ultimately can seriously damage economies. This is all well recognised – and yet it seems that even the world’s most sophisticated financial regimes cannot control the flow of suspect money through the system.

To get some perspective on the scale of the problem, the National Crime Agency estimates that the cost of money laundering to the UK economy is £24 billion a year. Globally, it is estimated that up to 5 per cent of global GDP – that’s £1.5 trillion – is laundered by criminals each year.

Money laundering is the process by which “dirty money” – which is to say money that is identifiable as the proceeds of crime – is made to look legitimate by passing it through financial systems to disguise its suspicious origins.

Various techniques are used, generally involving layers of transactions. This may involve moving money through different countries and then returning it in a way that looks legitimate. It may involve spurious transactions at inflated values such as paying a high price for a shell company, the purchase and resale of property or legitimate businesses.

Even fake litigation has been used to disguise the ultimate source of funds – a cash intensive business is set up, documents are created to suggest a legitimate debt and then a solicitor is approached to recover it. When the fake debtor makes a payment, the funds are passed through the solicitor’s bank account and back to the client.

The Danske case

In recognition of the extent of the problem, the G7 group of major economies formed the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering back in 1989. The idea behind this was to produce a set of standards and guidelines and to monitor progress on anti-money laundering regimes.

The focus is to identify suspicious transactions and report them. For anti-money laundering efforts to be successful, it requires financial institutions to know their customers. This means that banks must be able to identify the ultimate beneficial recipient of a transaction – so the person who takes the profit – of any customer on their books.

This is where Danske Bank ran into trouble. Its Estonian branch came about when Danske acquired Sampo Bank, a small Finnish Bank in 2007. Sampo had a non-resident portfolio in Estonia and it is this that caused the problems.

In the words of the independent report into the scandal, which preempted CEO Borgen’s resignation: “Anti-money laundering procedures at the Estonian branch had been manifestly insufficient and inadequate.” Danske Bank has also admitted there were “major deficiencies in controls and governance that made it possible to use Danske Bank’s branch in Estonia for criminal activities such as money laundering”.

Danske shut down the non-resident portfolio in 2015 after it became clear that the bank’s anti-money laundering procedures at the Estonian branch weren’t working. As a mere branch, Estonia should have been subject to Danske’s own money laundering systems – but the branch had its own IT platform, which meant it was not covered by the same risk monitoring as the bank’s Copenhagen headquarters.

The independent investigation found that more than half of Danske’s 15,000 customers in Estonia were suspicious. The source of funds passing through the portfolio was identified as more than 58 per cent coming from Russia, Estonia and Latvia. The destinations of the funds were worldwide.

The difficulty in identifying the true source of the funds comes from the lack of transparency as to the real owners of the customers in the portfolio. A proportion of them are UK-based companies that are registered as limited liability partnerships – this means they are not required to publish details of their eventual owners. This is a classic case of money laundering where ownership often passes through a series of shell companies before the eventual owner can be identified.

The customers are being investigated by several national authorities including the FBI and the UK National Crime Agency. The Danish regulator is investigating Danske Bank itself. Harsh penalties for the bank could ensue – Denmark’s business minister said the Danish authorities could fine Danske 4 billion Danish kroner (£475 million). But it remains to be seen what the long-term damage will be for Danske, if any.

A wider question surrounds the failure of international anti-money laundering regimes. To date there have been no examples of significant criminal sanctions for failure to implement an effective anti-money laundering process within a business. Nor is there any rigorous external scrutiny of how guidelines are implemented. But it is high time there was – while there is still a financial system to protect.","money laundering, specific company"

UKHNALYOVA, Svetlana Vladimirovna was born on March 14, 1973. By presidential decree #711 of May 31, 2004, she was appointed judge of the Tverskoy District Court of Moscow. By decree of the President of the Russian Federation of December 1, 2012 #1583, Svetlana Ukhnalyova was appointed the Deputy Chairwoman of the Kuntsevsky District Court.

Accused of:

Carrying out political repressions using her official position.

Judge Svetlana Uhnalyova was included in the Magnitsky Act’s list of international human rights violators. She has repeatedly participated in political-criminal prosecutions of opposition activists ranging from liberals to nationalists. She also participated in the Moscow Case, a politically motivated criminal prosecution of opposition activists who protested in the summer of 2019 against the prohibition of independent candidates from running in the Moscow City Duma elections.

In June 2009, she, as a judge of the Tverskoy District Court, extended the detention of Sergei Magnitsky and rejected his complaints about being transferred to the temporary detention center without notifying relatives, and refused the request to let his wife represent him. Note that prior to this Magnitsky and representatives of the Hermitage Capital investment fund had revealed the participation of senior law enforcement officials in the embezzlement of 5.4 billion rubles from the Russian budget through a fictitious VAT refund. Sergei Magnitsky spent almost a year in custody and died in jail in November 2009 after torture and denial of medical care. In July 2011, the U.S. Department of State adopted a sanctions list of Russian officials involved in the death of Sergei Magnitsky who were denied entry to the United States and whose bank accounts there will now be frozen. Judge Ukhnalyova also got on this list. The European Parliament adopted the Magnitsky Act in 2014.

On February 11, 2010, Judge Ukhnalyova refused to recognize the arrest of opposition leader Ilya Yashin on December 31, 2010, during a rally on Triumfalnaya Square as unlawful. Judge Ukhnaleva is an expert on Kremlin-disloyal nationalists. In 2010, in the framework of the case of nationalist protests on Manezhnaya Square, she sentenced a group of defendants. In 2012, she sentenced Vitaly Vasin to three years probation, Grigory Bilchenko to two years probation, Vladimir Kirpichnikov to three years in prison, and Nikolai Dvoinyakov to two years in prison. After these politically motivated cases, Ukhnalyova got a career promotion, becoming Deputy Chairperson of the Kuntsevsky district court.

In 2019, Judge Ukhnalyova led the case of Egor Zhukov, a blogger-student of the Higher School of Economics, who was accused of “public calls for extremism” on his YouTube channel. According to Tatyana Usmanova, coordinator of the Open Russia movement in Moscow, Ukhnalyova “banned” all independent linguists and their expertise during the trial. She refused to call the investigator, who, according to the defense, may have exceeded his authority.” Egor Zhukov, a libertarian, participated in an unauthorized rally in support of independent candidates to the Moscow City Duma on July 27 in Moscow. He was detained on August 2. Initially, he was charged with participation in the riots (Article 212 of the Criminal Code), but then this charge was dropped, and the student was transferred from the detention center to house arrest. However, later a new criminal case was opened against him, about calls for extremist activity on the Internet (Article 280 of the Criminal Code). Investigators and prosecutors, based on a linguistic study by an employee of the FSB Criminalistics Institute, Alexander Korshikov, argued that Egor Zhukov called for “violent changes in the constitutional system, riots and obstruction of the activities of state bodies, local authorities and election commissions” in a video on his YouTube channel. On December 6, 2019, Judge Ukhnalyova sentenced Zhukov to 3 years in prison with a ban on “administering sites on the Internet.”",Corruption

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore's central bank imposed penalties of S$5.2 million ($3.95 million) on Standard Chartered Bank (SCBC) STAN.L and S$1.2 million on Standard Chartered Trust (Singapore) (SCTS) for breaching money laundering rules and terrorism financing safeguards.

In a statement on Monday, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said the breaches occurred when trust accounts of SCBS’ customers were transferred from Standard Chartered Trust (Guernsey) to SCTS from December 2015 to January 2016.

“MAS requires financial institutions to adequately assess money laundering risks when deciding whether to accept customers. They should also have in place good systems and processes to monitor customer transactions,” said MAS Deputy Managing Director Ong Chong Tee.

The MAS and Guernsey’s Financial Services Commission had been looking into Standard Chartered’s movement of some assets, mainly of Indonesian clients in late 2015, just before the Channel Island adopted new global rules on exchanging tax information.

“The timing of the transfers raised questions of whether the clients were attempting to avoid their CRS reporting obligations. However, SCBS and SCTS did not adequately assess and mitigate against this risk factor, and also failed to file suspicious transaction reports in a timely manner,” MAS said.

In a statement, Standard Chartered conceded that it fell short of its own standards to mitigate risks but said it was taking action to rectify these deficiencies.

“We ourselves identified the issue, we recognized that we weren’t as diligent as we needed to be in the transfer of some trust assets from Guernsey to Singapore,” Standard Chartered’s CEO Bill Winters said at Credit Suisse’s annual Asia Investment Conference in Hong Kong on Monday. “We reported both our own shortcomings and also the action of our clients to the MAS,”

“The important thing...is we are making investments necessary to make sure there is no repeat,” he said.

This article is written by Yash Singhal from Vivekananda Institute of Professional Studies, New Delhi. The article is about the infamous Coalgate scam during the UPA government tenure and its legal aspects in detail.

Introduction

India has been a witness to several national level scams by the public officials. The Coalgate scam was one such scam where the UPA Government was accused of allocating coal blocks without the process of competitive bidding. These coal blocks are usually allocated to enterprises after an auction with the highest bidder acquiring the possession of the block. The government earns revenue on the sale of these blocks which is used for their operations.

The question that “Whether the coal block allocation by the government is within the legal framework?” will be answered in this article exhaustively.

What is the Coalgate scam?

The Coal Allocation scam or the Coalgate scam is a scandal that took place during the UPA government tenure. It came into reckoning in 2012 after the then Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) raised allegations against the government for allocation of coal blocks to public and private enterprises. Out of the total 216 coal blocks allocated between 1993-2010, 194 coal blocks were sold to these public and private enterprises for captive use.

The questions were raised in the CAG report over arbitrary administrative decisions while allocating the coal blocks and not following the particular procedure of the competitive bidding.

CAG Report

The democracy functions on the transparency of the representatives in the Parliament and its foundation trembles when the public is kept under the veil of non-transparency. Transparency is established when the general public is aware of every action of the government and have the means to oppose the actions in case they are aggrieved by those actions. The procedure prescribed for allocation of coal blocks to public and private enterprises was based on a fair practice of auction which had to be followed every time when the coal blocks were for sale. The CAG contended in its report that approximately the loss of Rs. 10.6 lakh crores was suffered by the exchequer while the final report tabled in Parliament displayed the figure at Rs. 1.86 lakh crore.

The government had the opportunity to take the prescribed procedure and maintain the transparency but they refused the competitive bidding process to arbitrarily allocate the coal blocks. There were allegations on certain politicians for favouring particular private players over others. Also, the report included a statement regarding several private players getting more coal blocks than needed for their captive operations, with some companies selling coal in the open market to earn profits.

Coal allocation guidelines

There were some guidelines issued for the coal allocation by the Ministry of Coal in 2011, with the preference to the power and steel sectors. There was a list of 10 guidelines that had to be taken into consideration to be a competing applicant for a captive block:

These guidelines were not duly followed by the Central Government while allocating the coal blocks to public and private enterprises.

Legal aspects

The Coalgate scam had certain legal aspects attached to it that must be discussed in detail to understand its gravity and what not to repeat in future. These aspects are provided as follows:

Ultra vires authority from Government

The central government in this coal allocation case was questioned for going beyond the powers conferred on them by the statutes governing coal and natural resources mining in India. The government took initiative to allocate the coal blocks without any auction. Neither of the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957, Mineral Concession Rules, 1960 and the Coal Mines (Nationalisation) Act, 1973 provided the central government with the authority to allocate coal blocks which were contended by the counsel of the petitioner in the Supreme Court. The court accepted the contention while observing that none of the stated statutes provide any procedure for allocation of blocks.

Invalidity but non-cancellation of allocations

The case of Manohar Lal Sharma v. The Principle Secretary & Others was decided by the Supreme Court where the petitioner was successful in proving the government action of allocating coal blocks without auction as a mode of biasness. The accused were charged under the provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988.

The Supreme Court declared the allocations as contrary to fairness and objected against the government action to favour companies in the process. While the allocations were declared illegal yet the cancellation of the contracts of the companies could not be achieved in entirety due to some of them starting the work on the blocks. The cancellation would have led to the loss of the companies that initiated the operations.

Administrative decision making

Administrative decision making is a field of administrative law in India which does not associate itself with any exclusive statute but has developed through the evolution of other statutes and the judicial pronouncements. The screening committee was constituted to take decisions on the allocation of the coal blocks. The whole process was an administrative process which was required to be dispensed under statutory provisions while following the competitive bidding procedure as part of administrative arrangements. The coal allocation process started to be monitored from 2010 when the Amendment Bill of Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act, 1957 was enacted while providing a framework to allocate coal blocks through competitive bidding.

It is a question of personal perspective as to whether the earlier Act could be applied in cases in the pre-2010 era to regulate the administrative decision making in the process of allocation or was it not adequate enough to handle such situations. In the latter case, the Act could have been amended earlier to include these provisions by the parliament to prevent questioning over corruptive government decisions. The statute based legal backing to the competitive bidding process would have made it obligatory for the administrative authority to implement them or face sanctions. The government lacking any enactment of rules in such favour subject them to an investigation probe where they have to answer why they did not have any precautionary measure in place.

Transparency improvement through administrative backing

The law governs those rules which are sanctioned by any statutory provisions but do not deal with any non-existent rules or regulations. It does not function on presumed rules until exclusively stated in the statute governing the orders. The coal allocation process was a non-transparent process with a lack of competitive bidding to provide a fair chance to every enterprise. The administrative backing through a statute would improve transparency with the committee’s obligation to dispense administrative decisions according to the authority stated in the statute. Any action in excess of the authority would impose legal sanctions on the authority which prevents them any diversion from assigned functions.

Arbitrariness

The process of coal blocks allocation for captive use has been an example of arbitrary action from the government. Arbitrariness is the practice of taking decisions without any reasonability and only on personal pleasure. The doctrine of arbitrariness stated under Article 14 of the Indian Constitution has been violated here. The absence of statutory law to favour competitive bidding is immaterial as Article 14 does not support arbitrary administrative action as it violates the rule of law.

Every administrative action is subjected to a test of arbitrariness where the authority needs to prove its action within the reasonableness sanctioned by the Indian Constitution and shall not support any sort of biases in the decision making process. The politicians have favoured some private enterprises over others which have shown arbitrary action from them.

In the case of Shrilekha Vidyarthi v. State of U.P., it was held that the state action can never be based on arbitrariness as the basic principle of Article 14 is fairness in action. Irrespective of the nature of the operation, the state action should be in pursuance of rule of law and it is the uppermost duty of the state to maintain it in every circumstance. In the present case, the fairness was not there in the state action through its administrative authorities when some particular enterprises were preferred without a suitable procedure of auction as a mode of rule of law through a fair procedure established by law.

In the case of Neelima Misra v. Harinder Kaur Paintal and Ors., it was decided that all authorities shall take decisions according to the Acts and the statutes and act in compliance with the powers and duties conferred on them. Every action should be bereft of illegality, irrationality or arbitrariness. Any action found to be either of these by any authority, in the exercise of legislative, administrative or quasi-judicial functions are liable to be quashed for violating Article 14. In this Coalgate scam, the administrative authority, i.e., the committee acted arbitrarily, hence, liable for the violation of Article 14.

In the case of Kasturi Lal Lakshmi Reddy v. State of Jammu and Kashmir & Anr., it was held that the government shall not exercise its power arbitrarily for its own favour. The purpose of every government action is a public good and that cannot be sacrificed in any manner whatsoever. Every action must be on reasonable grounds due to its direct effect on the public good. Every government action that is arbitrary would be deemed invalid. The present case did not leave any scope for the public good with the enterprises regarded as a group of individuals who deserved a fair chance. This fairness was not provided by the government-appointed administrative committee to get the coal block in an auction.

CBI- A Caged Parrot

The Supreme Court slammed the premier investigation agency of India as being ‘a caged parrot’ to its masters after the Apex Court examined the nine-page affidavit by the CBI as being alleged to be changed by the Law Minister and the Attorney General of India.

The court observed that the agency was being a puppet to the UPA Government during their tenure working as per their whims and fancies. The CBI has to be an autonomous body with no political affiliation to either of the parties and should work in the interest of the State. The reports being doctored by the accused themselves is a gross violation of the fair trial principle as the authority that is assigned the task of preparing reports after the investigation is under the control of the accused themselves. The court made reservations in the area of no minister to interfere in a CBI probe with no part of the investigation to be touched or altered.

Amendment to Coal Mines (Nationalisation) Act, 1973

The significant purpose to open tenders for any project by the government is to call for public or private enterprises to invest in the business while providing maximum output to cater to the demands of the population in the country. Therefore, every Government action is directed towards the public good. The amendment to the Coal Mines (Nationalisation) Act, 1973 would invite the domestic as well as the international companies to participate in the coal block allocation process.

The amended statute to make the auction compulsory for the allocation of coal blocks after 2010 would not leave any scope for bias or arbitrary action from the administrative authority. The competitive spirit in the domestic and the international companies to acquire the blocks would benefit the country as they would bid on the factors as to who can extract more from the particular mine. This extracted coal can be sold to compete with other monopoly-based companies in India.

Conclusion

The Coalgate scam has been a negative mark on the UPA tenure in India from 2004-2014 as it laid out all the wrongdoings by the ruling government. The scam is about a scandal in the allocation of coal blocks to the competing companies, that lacked the proper procedure of auctions through which the highest bidder could get the block.

The arbitrariness of the government along with their actual authority was questioned by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India in its report. The adding of a statute to make the process of competitive bidding a norm in the allocation process was accepted in 2010 after the 1957 Act was amended. The legal implications of this scam were observed by the Supreme Court while deciding the matter in favour of the petitioner. It had and will continue to have a major impact on the government action framework in regards to fair treatment of all people.

The fallout from a massive bribery scandal that helped to bring down a Brazilian president is spreading across Latin America, threatening to engulf leaders from Panama to Peru.

The workings of a secret “bribery department” at the Brazilian construction conglomerate Odebrecht that suborned government officials around the world for years are being exposed by investigators. Meticulous schemes of graft laid out by witnesses, in plea deals and in leaked and seized documents show how the company funnelled $800m (£641m) of payouts to politicians and parties in Latin America alone.

As prosecutors chase the trail of that cash, it has led them towards some of the region’s most prominent figures. Brazil’s president, Michel Temer, was accused in leaked testimony last year of taking campaign funds from Odebrecht, and the Panamanian president, Juan Carlos Varela, was implicated by a man who has himself been arrested in connection with the scandal. Both deny wrongdoing. In Argentina a federal judge is seeking information from Brazil and Switzerland to determine if the head of the spy agency took a $600,000 bribe from Odebrecht, which he also denies.

But perhaps the most surprising accusations came this week, when authorities implicated two men who have based their political careers on a reputation for integrity in countries plagued by graft. Peru sent out an Interpol arrest warrant for its former president Alejandro Toledo, on charges of taking some $20m in bribes. And Colombia’s chief prosecutor has said the country’s Nobel peace prize-winning president Juan Manuel Santos may have taken money for his re-election campaign. Both men have strongly denied the charges.

Toledo, who led Peru from 2001 to 2006, rose to power leading protests against the former president Alberto Fujimori, who was later jailed for corruption and human rights abuses. The country is still reeling from the news that Toledo could be joining his old opponent in prison. The front page of the local newspaper El Comercio reproached the former president, who comes from an indigenous family, with a headline quoting a traditional Andean commandment, “Ama Sua: do not steal”.

Authorities who offered a $30,000 reward for Toledo’s capture say he took the money in return for smoothing Odebrecht’s path to a lucrative contract for a road connecting Brazil to Peru’s Pacific coast. They have sought particular help from the US, where Toledo is a visiting scholar at Stanford University, and from Israel. His wife has Israeli citizenship and the country does not have an extradition treaty with Peru, so officials fear he may try to seek refuge there.

Santos has been accused by Colombia’s chief prosecutor Nestor Martinez of taking up to $1m in campaign donations, based on the testimony of an ex-senator who was jailed for allegedly channelling Odebrecht cash but also has ties to Santos’s opponents. Martinez plans to travel to Brazil this week to look for evidence to support the accusation, Reuters reported. Santos has rejected the allegations, but the case could be particularly damaging to a leader who took a fierce public stance on the unfolding scandal.

He threatened last month that the “full weight of the law” would fall on anyone accused of taking Odebrecht cash, and his government was the first outside Brazil to arrest former officials after the firm admitted a history of corruption in a plea deal with the US justice department. Odebrecht agreed to pay $3.5bn in penalties to authorities in Switzerland, the US and Brazil to settle the case. However, many in Latin America and beyond believe that agreement could mark just the beginning of efforts to unravel a complex and entrenched network of corruption. US prosecutors, when they announced the deal, described an extraordinary normalisation of graft within the firm, that suggested few countries where it operated would have been immune.

“[They] used a hidden but fully functioning Odebrecht business unit – a ‘Department of Bribery’, so to speak – that systematically paid hundreds of millions of dollars to corrupt government officials in countries on three continents,” said the US deputy assistant attorney general Sung-Hee Suh.

Many more details about the system and the people who benefited from it are thought to be laid out in testimony from former top executives at Odebrecht, nicknamed the “end of the world confessions” by local media. They form a key part of plea deals made by 77 senior executives from the company and its former boss Marcelo Odebrecht, grandson of the founder.

They have not been made public, but few people in Brazil expect their explosive contents to stay secret forever, and a single confession leaked so far implicates the deeply unpopular Temer in taking a multimillion-pound campaign donation from the group.

He denies taking the money, but is now the second Brazilian leader whose future has been jeopardised by the firm’s corruption. It was part of the wider Car Wash scandal that was a major driver in the impeachment of Dilma Rousseff last year, although she was ousted for breaking budget laws and has not been personally implicated.

In Panama the unfolding scandal has caught up both the president and his accuser Ramón Fonseca, a former friend and one of the founders of the law firm at the centre of the Panama Papers scandal, Fonseca himself was arrested along with his business partner Juergen Mossack as part of an inquiry into his connections with Odebrecht shortly after insisting that Varela had taken campaign money from the group.

“He [Varela] told me that he had accepted donations from Odebrecht because he could not fight with everyone,” Fonseca said, without giving more details. Varela denied receiving funds and promised to make all donations to his political campaign public.","Needs registering, but scrapeable"

The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority has sanctioned San Antonio broker-dealer Braymen, Lambert and Noel Securities Ltd. and one of its principals.

FINRA, the securities industry’s self-policing organization, censured and fined Braymen, Lambert and Noel Securities, or BLNS, $70,000. FINRA also fined firm partner Shannon Braymen $20,000 and suspended her for a month.

BLNS and Braymen consented to the sanctions without admitting or denying FINRA’s findings.

“I did nothing wrong,” Braymen said in an interview. “No clients were hurt. No monies were lost. No complaints were filed.”

Neither Braymen nor the firm has any prior formal disciplinary history with FINRA.

FINRA found BLNS failed to actively supervise the firm’s participation in nine private placement offerings from April 2007 to November 2011.

“Specifically, the firm had no documentation of principal review and approval of any of the offering documents for the nine offerings (and) no documentation that a principal of the firm had conducted due diligence on any of the offerings,” according to a “Letter of Acceptance, Waiver and Consent” that Braymen submitted to FINRA.

The letter also said the firm lacked customer subscription documents that were required to determine customers’ suitability for the investments.

Braymen said she had been doing business the same way for 13 years before FINRA conducted an audit in November 2011.

“They said I didn’t do secondary due diligence on private placements, which I didn’t need to do because the due diligence was already done, and nobody was complaining or losing money.” The analysis had been completed by numerous lawyers and analysts, she added.

“No red flags were raised, and all of a sudden FINRA says, ‘You’re doing it wrong and we’re going to fine you,’” she said. “I felt blindsided.”

She said a more appropriate response from FINRA would have been “a slap on the hand.”

The private placements involved various medical-related companies. Among them, Braymen said, were cancer drug developer Azaya Therapeutics and medical device manufacturer BiO2 Medical Inc., both of San Antonio.

BLNS also operated two unregistered branch offices in San Antonio and Austin, FINRA said.",sanction against smn

ISLAMABAD: Two cases have surfaced regarding terror financing in Bahamas Leaks. The names of two companies Akida Islamic Bank and Altaf Khanani’s company have come forward.

After 9/11 the US had imposed sanctions on Akida Islamic Bank which were lifted later.

One of the companies belongs to Obaid Altaf Khanani whose father Altaf Khanani is imprisoned in the US on money laundering charges. Altaf Khanani was arrested in Pakistan in 2009 but was released by the court. His name was placed on the Exit Control List but despite this he fled to Dubai. He was later arrested in the US following an agreement between the US and UAE.

Akida Islamic Bank is also registered as an offshore company in the Bahamas. Former Jamaat-e-Islami Senator Professor Khurshid Ahmed is among its directors. When contacted Professor Ahmed said he had been the director of the bank but did not own any financial stake.

Action Targets Drug Trafficker Operating in the Port of Callao and his Network

Washington – Today, the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) designated Peruvian national Gino Dusan Padros Degregori as a Specially Designated Narcotics Trafficker (SDNT) pursuant to the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act (Kingpin Act) for playing a significant role in international narcotics trafficking. OFAC also designated Peruvian national Guillermo Jean Pierre Zegarra Martinez, a key financial facilitator for Padros Degregori, for providing material assistance, support, or goods or services in support of the international narcotics trafficking activities of, and acting for or on behalf of, Padros Degregori. Three businesses in Lima, Peru, that are owned or controlled by Padros Degregori, were also designated. As a result of today's action, U.S. persons are generally prohibited from engaging in transactions or otherwise dealing with these individuals and entities, and any assets they may have under U.S. jurisdiction are frozen.

""Treasury, in coordination with our law enforcement partners, continues to target and disrupt the activities of those who play a significant role in narcotics trafficking throughout the world,"" said OFAC Director John E. Smith. ""Today's action highlights the increasing reach of Peruvian drug trafficking organizations that move significant amounts of cocaine to Europe and North America.""

Today's OFAC designation was taken in coordination with the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and Customs and Border Protection's National Targeting Center.

Padros Degregori has been involved in narcotics trafficking for more than a decade, exploiting Lima's Port of Callao to ship approximately 1,000-kilogram cocaine loads per month concealed in containerized cargo – including heavy machinery – to destinations in Western Europe, Mexico, and the United States. Padros Degregori has ties to Mexican drug trafficking organizations that maintain a strong presence in Peru, including the Sinaloa Cartel. He also launders millions in drug proceeds in U.S. dollars and euros back to Peru from both the United States and Europe. Zegarra Martinez travels to the United States and Europe where he supports the collection and laundering of narcotics proceeds destined for Peru on behalf of Padros Degregori.

The Peruvian businesses designated by OFAC are all owned, controlled, or directed by Padros Degregori. The Lima-based businesses include R Inver Corp S.A.C., a real estate and construction company; G & M Autos S.A.C., an automobile repair shop; and SBK Import S.A.C., an importer of automobiles, boats, and heavy machinery.

Since June 2000, more than 2,000 individuals and entities have been named pursuant to the Kingpin Act for their role in international narcotics trafficking. Penalties for violations of the Kingpin Act range from civil penalties of up to $1,437,153 per violation to more severe criminal penalties. Criminal penalties for corporate officers may include up to 30 years in prison and fines up to $5 million. Criminal fines for corporations may reach $10 million. Other individuals could face up to 10 years in prison and fines pursuant to Title 18 of the United States Code for criminal violations of the Kingpin Act.

Four narco-signs appeared this morning in Playa del Carmen bearing messages that suggest Monday morning’s shooting at a beachfront bar was related to drug trafficking.

“This is a warning that we are already here because you didn’t align yourself Phillip – BPM,” the message read. “It is the beginning, we are going to cut off the heads of Golfos, Pelones and chapulines. Sincerely, El Fayo Z from the old school.”

“Phillip” is presumably BPM Festival co-founder Phillip Pulitano while “Golfos” and “Pelones” could refer to the drug gangs Cartel del Golfo and Los Pelones.

The message could mean that the Zetas cartel was behind the shooting.

The Facebook-based news outlet Semanario Playa News, which broke the story of the narco-signs, reported that “Fayo Z” could be Quintana Roo Zeta leader Rafael del Ángel Velez Morales.

Five people died and 15 were wounded in gunfire at the Blue Parrot, a venue for the closing night of the 10-day BPM Festival, an international electronic music festival held annually in Playa del Carmen.

The state’s Attorney General said this morning that investigators were examining the possibility that drug sales were the principal motive in the shooting, caused by dealers fighting over territory.

Miguel Ángel Pech has said that extortion is also being considered as a motive.

He said security video shows the attacker enter the bar and fire five times at a man who has been identified as part of the festival’s security team. However, his family said the man, who lived in Veracruz, was actually a telephone company employee on vacation in the Riviera Maya resort city.

The shooter is believed to have fled in a taxi, whose driver has a criminal record for extortion and is also a former municipal police officer.

The dead have been identified as:

• Kirk Wilson, a Canadian who was the festival’s security supervisor at the Blue Parrot;

• Daniel Pessina, an Italian and a member of the festival staff;

• Alejandra Margarita Villanueva Ibarra, from the U.S.;

• Geovanni Francisco Ruiz Murillo, of Veracruz; and

• Rafael Antonio Peñaloza Vega, also of Veracruz.

Authorities have not said which of the victims the attacker was after.

However, the newspaper Milenio reported that Ruiz Murillo, who was hit four times during the shooting, had two Facebook profiles, one of which showed him in a police uniform and carrying arms.

In the other his profile picture showed him with an AK-47 firearm and a post advised he had a new job.

This year’s BPM Festival was the 10 th but may well be its last, in Playa del Carmen at least. “At the moment our position is that BPM will not happen [again],” said Mayor Cristina Torres Gómez yesterday afternoon.

She told a press conference there would be a reassessment of the requirements and procedures for obtaining permits in terms of security so as to guarantee the safety of tourists and residents.

“. . . we have to analyze the type of destination we want to have, what type of events we want to have and promote . . . .”

Another similar festival, Arena Festival 2017, scheduled for February 1-6, has been suspended while stronger security measures are considered, the mayor said.

The business community made its position clear yesterday. “We’re asking for these kinds of events to go away,” said María Helena Mata Pineda, president of the local branch of the Business Coordinating Council. “We don’t want BPM here anymore, or any other similar event.”",suspicions of murder

New York state filed civil charges on Wednesday accusing Endo International Plc of insurance fraud for misrepresenting the safety and efficacy of its opioid drugs, adding fuel to the nation’s opioid crisis.

Governor Andrew Cuomo said the charges brought by New York’s Department of Financial Services are the second in that regulator’s probe into the opioid industry, following similar charges against Mallinckrodt Plc on April 21.

New York said Endo, which made 18.4% of opioids distributed from 2006 to 2014 in the state, downplayed the risks of addiction and abuse of opioids such as its Opana ER, giving patients greater comfort about using them to relieve pain.

It also said Endo knew it was contributing to a “massive” surge in opioid prescriptions, leading to payments of fraudulent insurance claims on medically unnecessary prescriptions.

“All these opioid manufacturers knew how addictive and dangerous their products were,” Cuomo said in a statement. “Their greedy, fraudulent behavior is inexcusable.”

Endo removed a reformulated Opana ER from the market in July 2017 after a request from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

New York charged Endo with violating two state insurance laws, with civil penalties of up to $5,000 per violation.

Endo did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Its shares closed down 66.5 cents, or 14.7%, at $3.845 on the Nasdaq, with most of the decline in late trading after the charges were announced.

The company is based in Dublin, Ireland, and has offices in Malvern, Pennsylvania.

Opioids have contributed to more than 400,000 deaths since 1997, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Endo said in a recent regulatory filing it faced more than 3,200 opioid-related lawsuits, mainly by cities, counties and other municipalities.

OTTAWA—Allegations of political interference in the criminal prosecution of a major Canadian corporation have swamped national politics.

Over the past week, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his Liberals have been consumed by an escalating controversy, after a bombshell newspaper report alleged officials in the PMO pushed the former justice minister to put an end to a fraud and corruption trial and mediate a solution with the accused company, SNC-Lavalin.

The opposition NDP decry the situation as more evidence Trudeau’s Liberals are beholden to big business, while the Conservatives are accusing the government of trying to cover up a major scandal. Some say the situation hearkens back to Liberal debacles of old, such as the corruption of the “sponsorship scandal.” And Indigenous leaders, among others, contend the situation undercuts Trudeau’s lofty rhetoric on reconciliation and feminism — key aspects of the image Trudeau’s Liberals like to project.

From the pinnacle of political power to the boardroom of a multinational corporation, the SNC-Lavalin scandal involves a lot of people.

Here are the main players in the story so far:

Jody Wilson-Raybould

Canada’s first Indigenous justice minister and attorney general is at the heart of the controversy. But so far, Wilson-Raybould has been silent on allegations that the Prime Minister’s Office pressured her to halt criminal proceedings in the fraud and corruption case against SNC-Lavalin and offer the company a mediation deal. Apparently bound from speaking because of solicitor-client privilege, the Vancouver MP resigned from cabinet and has retained a former Supreme Court justice to determine how she can tell her side of the story.

Justin Trudeau

The prime minister at first would only say that Wilson-Raybould was never “directed” to mediate with SNC-Lavalin — a denial that Liberal MPs later expanded to say there was no “pressure” on her to do so either. Later, he said her continued presence in cabinet, as veterans’ affairs minister, should speak for itself. Only she resigned the next day. Trudeau was “surprised and disappointed” by the move, and continues to insist his office never broke any rules in discussions with the former attorney general about SNC-Lavalin’s criminal case.

SNC-Lavalin

Based in Montreal, the engineering and construction giant has 50,000 employees around the world, about 8,700 of them in Canada. Since it was charged with fraud and corruption for its activities in Libya — one of several instances of corporate criminal activity in recent years — SNC-Lavalin has lobbied the prime minister’s office, senior federal bureaucrats and at least six cabinet ministers on the subject of “justice and law enforcement.” Company CEO Neil Bruce did much of the lobbying, according to the federal registry. Bill Pristanksi, executive assistant to former prime minister Brian Mulroney, and Bruce Hartley, who was executive assistant to Jean Chrétien, are also registered lobbyists for the company.

Kathleen Roussel

The federal director of public prosecutions is a former Queens University graduate in religious studies, and University of Ottawa law grad. She once told a committee she didn’t particularly enjoy law school but enjoyed the work when she joined the federal justice department. As director of public prosecutions, she is supposed to be at arms’ length from the attorney-general, formerly Jody Wilson-Raybould now David Lametti, when it comes to most prosecution decisions. But the attorney-general can overrule her in certain cases, but only if the reasons are delivered in writing and published by the federal government. Roussel received many submissions by SNC-Lavalin, but turned down its request to meet in person, and rejected the company’s plea to negotiate a deal.

Michael Wernick

As Clerk of the Privy Council, Canada’s top bureaucrat, Wernick likely has insight into the SNC-Lavalin situation. He was lobbied by the company about justice and law enforcement last September, and the opposition wants him to testify about the affair at the House of Commons justice committee. In a meeting Dec. 5, the prime minister’s top adviser told Wilson-Raybould to discuss SNC-Lavalin’s criminal case with Wernick, according to Trudeau’s spokesperson.

Gerald Butts

The opposition parties also want to hear from Butts, Trudeau’s principal secretary in the PMO. He has been at Trudeau’s side since before he was prime minister, and is often cast by the government’s critics as the chief orchestrator of Liberals’ political strategy. Butts was lobbied by SNC-Lavalin on justice and law enforcement once, in 2017, though other staff in the PMO have had more interactions with the company on that subject. They include senior advisers Mathieu Bouchard and Elder Marques, and Cyrus Reporter, a former adviser who has since left the PMO.

Mario Dion

Canada’s Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner Mario Dion has launched an investigation into the SNC-Lavalin allegations. In a letter to NDP MPs that asked him to look into it, Dion said he has “reason to believe” section nine of Parliament’s conflict of interest law may have been broken. That section prohibits a public office holder from trying to influence a decision to improperly advance another person’s private interests.

Anthony Housefather

The chair of the House of Commons justice committee, a backbench Liberal MP from Montreal, was thrust into a position of moderating the acrimonious debate over who to call to answer questions in a public hearing about the affair. In the end, he was among the Liberal members to block attempts by the opposition to call the major players who could shed light on what happened: including Butts, Wilson-Raybould and others. The committee will meet again on Tuesday, behind closed doors, to discuss how to move forward.

David Lametti

The MP for Lasalle-Emard-Verdun made the leap from parliamentary secretary into cabinet and into the justice hot seat in the Jan. 14 cabinet shuffle. A McGill law prof on leave from his job teaching intellectual property law, Lametti stumbled early on when he defended the prime minister publicly in the Commons. He said neither Trudeau nor his officials applied any pressure to his predecessor, Wilson-Raybould on the SNC-Lavalin file. Lametti later admitted that he did not speak to Ms.Wilson-Raybould to hear her version of events, but had taken the prime minister’s word for it. He also suggested that the option of negotiating a remediation agreement with SNC-Lavalin was not completely off the table, even as the issue is currently before a Federal Court judge.",corruption

Ukraine’s state intelligence agency announced on November 18 that it had detained a man wanted by Interpol for the high-profile murder of American journalist Paul Klebnikov in Russia 13 years ago. Russia’s Interior Ministry on November 20 named the suspect as Magomed Dukuzov and said that Ukrainian authorities had apprehended him at its request, according to Russian news agency TASS.

Klebnikov, a New Yorker of Russian descent, was working as editor of Forbes’ Russian edition when he was gunned down outside its Moscow office on the evening of July 9, 2004. He was 41. Klebnikov’s colleagues and Russian media reported at the time that the motive may have been the journalist’s work investigating Russia’s often violent criminal underworld and shady dealings of some of its powerful business elite.

Contacted by CPJ via email on November 20, Klebnikov’s brother, Peter, responded to news of the arrest, saying, “The issue is really who is the mastermind, and in identifying, investigating and finding him, the Russian government has failed completely. So this arrest, while important, is still a bit of a sideshow.”

When the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) announced the arrest in a statement, it alleged that the Russian national of Chechen origin “participated in a number of assassinations, in particular, the editor-in-chief of the Russian edition of Forbes and the deputy chairman of the apparatus of the government of the Chechen Republic in 2001-2003.”

The agency said that after fleeing Russia, the suspect, whom it did not identify, allegedly became involved in “an organized criminal group, which in Ukraine was engaged in extorting money from private entrepreneurs.”

The SBU said that it is conducting necessary procedures, including those related to extradition. But it remains unclear if or when Dukuzov could be returned to Russia. When reached by phone, the SBU in Kiev declined to comment, citing procedure and telling CPJ to send a written request. CPJ did not immediately receive a response to that request. Russia’s Interior Ministry did not return CPJ calls or an emailed request.

But Russia’s Interior Ministry did confirm the arrest in a statement given to the Interfax news agency, in which it said the Russian Prosecutor-General’s Office had also been notified of Dukuzov’s capture.

Since Klebnikov’s murder in 2004, little progress has been made in the case. Three people charged in Russia in 2006, including Dukuzov’s brother, Kazbek, were later acquitted. Russia’s Supreme Court overturned the verdict and ordered a retrial for Kazbek Dukuzov, but he fled before the proceedings could be held, Forbes reported.

Russian authorities sought Magomed Dukuzov in connection with the murder, the state news agency ITAR-TASS reported at the time. But he was not apprehended until last week.

The Klebnikov family said in a statement in 2006 that it viewed the Supreme Court ruling as a “hopeful sign for justice” but it was disappointed that “Paul’s killers and those who ordered this vicious crime are still at large.”

Peter Klebnikov told CPJ, “[The family] continue to expect justice, and are willing to cooperate with the Russian authorities but have received virtually no communication from them in recent months.”

Kazbek Dukuzov is believed to be imprisoned in the United Arab Emirates for crimes unrelated to the killing of Klebnikov, according to a 2013 Forbes report. The same report said that Kazbek Dukuzov had been blacklisted by the U.S. under the Magnitsky Act, а law meant to punish Russians implicated in human rights abuses.

The Russian Prosecutor-General’s Office has alleged that Chechen separatist leader Khozh-Akhmed Nukhayev, a subject of a critical book published by Klebnikov in 2003, mastermind the journalist’s killing.

The U.S.-born Klebnikov, who was of Russian descent, moved to Moscow in 2004 to launch the Russian edition of Forbes magazine. The first edition hit newsstands in April 2004. Two-and-a half months later, Klebnikov was gunned down outside the Moscow office.

Klebnikov is one of 38 journalists murdered in direct retaliation for their work in Russia since 1992. Of those, 33 were killed with complete impunity, according to CPJ research.","Murder, Sanctions, Human rights violation"

On Wednesday, something surprising and strange happened in Brazil: The president, Dilma Rousseff, appointed former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, her political mentor, to her own Cabinet.

That same day, a Brazilian judge ordered the government to release a wiretap recording of Rousseff — yes, the government is listening in on its own president — speaking to Lula, as he's commonly known.

The recording seemed to reveal that Rousseff had appointed Lula to save him from prosecution in a multibillion-dollar corruption scandal involving the state-run oil company Petrobras. (Under Brazilian law, ministers go to special courts that have historically never prosecuted them.)

Subsequently, a separate judge ordered a pause on Lula's appointment, suggesting it may have been illegal.

This is just the latest House of Cards– style twist in the Petrobras scandal — the largest corruption scandal, in dollar terms, in any democracy ever.

""Guys,"" he told prosecutors, ""if I speak, the republic is going to fall""

The scandal is shaking the Brazilian political establishment to its very foundations — and it comes amid a recession, as well as a largely separate effort by Rousseff's political rivals to impeach her over unrelated financial improprieties.

Millions of Brazilians have taken to the streets in protest. The Brazilian political system is paralyzed, and could well be thrown into further chaos if Rousseff is ousted.

But in the long term, some observers say that the Petrobras investigation is a good thing. Brazil has been plagued by severe corruption for much of its modern history. This scandal could signal that the era of impunity may be ending. Until just six years ago, no sitting politician had ever been successfully prosecuted on corruption charges.

What we're seeing today could potentially be epochal: one of the world's largest countries finally coming to terms with one of its biggest problems. But that's the long, optimistic view. For now, it's a huge mess.

Here are the basics of what's happening, why it matters, and how this became such a big deal.

How the Petrobras scandal worked

Between about 2004 and 2014, the state-run energy firm Petrobras — which is Brazil's largest company and one of the largest corporations in the world — engaged in one of the most astonishing corruption schemes ever to be uncovered. That Petrobras employees and their co-conspirators thought they could get away with it speaks to just how bad corruption in Brazil had become.

Nobody knows who exactly came up with the scheme. But it was developed during the commodities boom of the 2000s, when oil prices were high, and involved three main groups of players: leaders at Petrobras, top executives at Brazil's major construction companies, and Brazilian politicians.

It worked in four steps:

Construction executives secretly created a cartel to coordinate bids on Petrobras contracts and systematically overcharge the company.
A select group of Petrobras employees turned a blind eye, allowing the construction companies to charge Petrobras outrageous sums.
The construction executives then pocketed the proceeds from these inflated contracts and rewarded their partners inside Petrobras with big bribes.
Some of the proceeds also got sent to friendly politicians, as either personal gifts or donations to their campaigns. Because Petrobras is partially owned by the state, politicians can install people as executives — who then turn around and reward that politician with a bribe.

Huge sums of money, according to the New York Times, would be ""hand-delivered by an elderly gentleman who flew around the world with bricks of cash, shrink-wrapped and strapped beneath thigh-high socks and a Spanx-like vest."" Sometimes bribes would be distributed in the form of ""Rolex watches, $3,000 bottles of wine, yachts, helicopters and prostitutes.""

All in all, somewhere upward of $5.3 billion changed hands as part of this scheme.

Why corruption is so bad in Brazil

It seems astonishing that anyone involved in the Petrobras scheme thought they could get away with something this large. But corruption has long been widespread in Brazil. To understand how that came to be, you need to go back a bit — to the first days of the country's founding.

The Portuguese began colonizing the area we now know as Brazil during the early 1500s, and before long it became the hub for the Atlantic slave trade, dwarfing even the colonies in what would become the United States. Portuguese colonists used slaves to grow sugar and mine gold, bringing those colonists enormous wealth — and developing what would become a deeply entrenched caste system.

By the time Brazil declared independence, in 1822, the caste system had hardened along clear lines — the white elite was fabulously wealthy, while the darker-skinned slaves and laborers were deeply impoverished.

The country formally abolished slavery only in 1888 — the last country to do so in the Western world. But class hierarchies remained. The Brazilian elite retained their advantages, and used their wealth to entrench their own power in society. One common method they developed for doing this was by bribing government officials.

""Brazil is a country that's defined by its income inequality,"" Brian Winter, the vice president of the Americas Society and Council on the Americas, told me. Winter calls this inequality ""the most important structural factor"" in encouraging Brazilian corruption.

""Until 2010, the chances of you going to jail, especially if you were a politician, were virtually nil""

""You had this tiny elite that really thought they could get away with anything, and often did,"" he said. ""The corruption comes from that.""

This problem persisted throughout Brazilian history, through multiple governments and even a military coup in the 1960s.

""There's a famous president of Brazil who ran on the slogan of 'sweeping away corruption' in the 1950s,"" Matthew Taylor, an American University scholar who studies Brazilian corruption, explained. ""He even carried a broom around ... to show that he was serious about corruption.""

Over time, corruption became more normalized. For decades, prosecutors and police failed to investigate corruption, creating a climate of impunity in which even the grossest corruption became business as usual.

""Until 2010,"" Taylor said, ""the chances of you going to jail, especially if you were a politician, were virtually nil.""

Estimates suggest that in Brazil, roughly ""3 to 5 percent of GDP is lost to corruption,"" according to Taylor.

It's important to note that Brazil is far from unique in this regard: A number of other Latin American countries, for example, have similar corruption problems, sometimes owing to similar factors. But Brazil is a much bigger country — the world's fifth largest by population and seventh by GDP — so the scale of the problem is larger as well.

Petrobras, then, is the culmination of what happens when you have a corruption problem building, more or less unchecked, over several generations and in one of the world's largest countries.

One of the craziest parts of this scandal: how it was uncovered

The Petrobras scandal came to light almost by accident, in mid-2013, when Brazilian police detained a money launderer named Alberto Youssef, who had been previously arrested nine times, on yet another money laundering charge.

But this time, Youssef had something very different to say.

""Guys,"" Youssef reportedly told prosecutors, ""if I speak, the republic is going to fall.""

Youssef began to describe what we now know as the Petrobras scandal. Police, in response, in early 2014 made their first arrest in Operation Car Wash, so named, reportedly, because some of the money had been laundered through an actual car wash.

The first to fall was Paulo Roberto Costa, a former Petrobras official whom Youssef had bribed by giving him a Land Rover. Police arrested Costa in March 2014, and he too cooperated. Between those two sources, police had enough information to begin going after some of Brazil's wealthiest and most powerful individuals.

The investigation into Petrobras is run out of Brazil's Public Ministry, a unique institution established by the Brazilian constitution. Basically, it's like an attorney general's office designated specifically for cases in the broad public interest, including wrongdoing by government officials.

""Some people liken it to a fourth branch of government,"" Taylor explains. ""It has its own budget, and each of the prosecutors is autonomous — not just from the executive, but from each other.""

""Petrobras is a different kind of scandal""

This institution exists, according to Taylor, as a direct result of Brazil's long struggle to throw off its history of dictatorship.

In 1964, the Brazilian military overthrew the president and instituted a dictatorship that lasted for 20 years. In 1985, when Brazil returned to democracy and established a new constitution, the country's leader felt that a special prosecutor's office was necessary to restore rule of law and democratic accountability.

In 1998 this office was strengthened further, and was granted the complete independence it enjoys today.

""Coming out of 20 years of dictatorship,"" Taylor says, ""the country was looking to repair some of the damage that dictatorship had caused.""

Over time, rule of law and democratic governance strengthened in Brazil in other, more organic ways. The police and judiciary became more assertive and more independent, for example, as did prosecutors. As the legacy of dictatorship waned and those institutions developed, they gradually became strong enough, and independent enough, to take on larger corruption issues that might have otherwise been tolerated.

This development is an important part of how the Petrobras investigation came to be. A group of officials from across the Brazilian government had developed real expertise investigating and prosecuting corruption cases.

Working with a judge named Sergio Moro, who has a lot of experience with anti-corruption investigations, they began pulling on the thread provided by Youssef's 2013 confession. But they had no idea how much it would eventually unravel.

How Petrobras became a national crisis

Between March 2014 and March 2015, dozens of engineers, construction executives, and Petrobras officials were arrested as part of Operation Car Wash. Each arrest allowed prosecutors to gather more evidence, often through plea bargains wherein implicated figures outed co-conspirators.

In March 2015, the scandal really blew up: Brazil's Supreme Court announced that it was investigating 34 politicians on suspicion of involvement in the scandal — a political scandal.

Since the scandal began, 86 people have been convicted of crimes relating to Petrobras in total, most of them members of Brazil's political or economic elite.

The scandal has infuriated the Brazilian public, sparking enormous demonstrations. Last Sunday, somewhere between 1 million and 3.5 million people turned out to protest.

""There has always been a general acknowledgement by everyday citizens that there is some degree of corruption,"" Natasha Borges Sugiyama, a political scientist at the University of Wisconsin Milwaukee, says. ""Petrobras is a different kind of scandal.""

According to Sugiyama, part of the issue is scale: Ordinary Brazilian corruption doesn't cost the nation billions of dollars. But it's also about who is involved in the corruption. Leaders of Brazil's largest state-owned company, its biggest construction firms, and political leaders from across the political spectrum have been fingered by prosecutors. It's a damning indictment of the entire elite class.

""The scandal has implicated broad swaths of the elite,"" Sugiyama says. ""It has revealed people's disquiet [with] the political elite.""

As one telling example, it's worth dwelling on the conviction of Marcelo Odebrecht, the head of Brazil's largest construction company. In March 2016, Odebrecht was sentenced to 19 years for bribery and money laundering.

""The recession is driving the anger""

Odebrecht is old money: His company was founded by his grandfather, who had built it up in the 1950s. Odebrecht exemplifies everything that infuriates Brazilians about the Petrobras scandal: a rich boy who has corrupted the Brazilian government in order to make himself even richer.

Worsening outrage, Brazil's economy is doing poorly at the moment. Years of high government spending helped create a debt and inflation problem. The collapse in oil and other commodities prices has shrunk some of Brazil's most lucrative industries. It's an even worse version of the stagflation Americans experienced in the 1970s: The Brazilian real (its currency) is rapidly losing value at the same time as the country is experiencing a recession.

The malfeasance of the Brazilian elite, then, is coming out just as ordinary Brazilians are experiencing truly difficult times. Traditional anti-elitism and economic pressures are sparking an explosion of anger.

""The recession is driving the anger,"" Winter says. ""There was a corruption scandal of smaller, but still epic proportions, 10 years ago ... and the [incumbent] government survived, in large part because the economy was good.""

Petrobras is endangering President Rousseff's government

The Petrobras scandal is a true disaster for President Rousseff — polls have found that about two-thirds of Brazilians want her impeached.

The problem isn't that she was directly involved. ""Nobody believes Dilma participated in this,"" Winter says flatly.

Still, from 2003 to 2010 Rousseff was the chairwoman of Petrobras's board. This all occurred under her watch, a seemingly damning indictment of her own judgment and competence.

It's also damaging to her party. The Workers' Party (PT) has cultivated a reputation for cleanliness, for sticking up for the common people against a corrupt system. The clear evidence that a number of PT politicians were involved in Petrobras has tarnished that brand considerably.

""The PT, when it first came to office, was seen as the party of ethics that would clean up Brazilian politics,"" Taylor says. ""For Brazilians to see the PT arm in arm with politicians who have been proven to be corrupt ... is extraordinarily frustrating.""

Which brings us to Lula, the former president now implicated as well.

Two weeks ago, police searched Lula's home in connection with Petrobras, and temporarily detained him. Later that day, police released a statement saying that he had personally taken dirty money, leading many Brazilians to conclude that he would soon be indicted.

This has been damaging for Rousseff as well. Lula, who was president from 2003 until 2011, was Rousseff's political mentor. They are often viewed as something of a political pair, for better or worse.

But the protests against them have tended to draw from the middle class and other relatively privileged segments of society.

""Polls suggest the demonstrations are dominated by white and upper-middle-class people,"" the BBC reports. ""One survey of protesters in Sao Paulo indicated that protesters were much wealthier than average and that three-quarters were white (compared to less than half of the general population).""

That's because Lula and Rousseff have made care for the poorer and less white segments of Brazil a top priority. Lula, in his presidency, pushed through the Bolsa Familia program, a poverty relief initiative that distributed cash to about 12 million poor Brazilian families.

As a result, many poor Brazilians are deeply loyal to the PT, even in the face of the Petrobras scandal. You can see how this plays out in a photo from a recent protest: It shows a white couple walking to a protest with their dog, dressed in Brazil's national colors. Alongside them there's a black nanny, dressed in an all-white maid's uniform, walking their kids in a stroller:

— SubMedina (@SubMedina) March 15, 2016

The photo went viral and has come to symbolize, for many Brazilians, the way the upper middle class set the political agenda over Petrobras.

What happens next?

Barring any more shocking revelations — which I wouldn't rule out — the big political questions going forward are whether Rousseff survives to serve out her remaining time in office (her term ends in 2019), and what the consequences of the scandal will be for Brazil's 2018 national elections to pick her successor.

For now, Rousseff is refusing to resign. Speaker of the House Eduardo Cunha — who is himself, ironically enough, being investigated as part of the Petrobras scandal — filed impeachment charges last year, but the charges died due to lack of political support.

However, the new evidence against Lula — as well as the secondary scandal surrounding Rousseff's attempt to appoint Lula to her Cabinet — may well change the impeachment calculus. On March 17, Cunha refiled the impeachment charges.

The impeachment charges are not actually connected to Petrobras. Rather, Rousseff is accused of fudging government accounting to hide the scope of the government's deficit problem during the 2014 reelection campaign.

But legislators may be more likely to support her impeachment because of Petrobras. If public outrage keeps up, legislators may feel real pressure to vote against her.

""The big question is what the street protests do,"" Taylor says. ""There were big protests on Sunday — 3 million — and those were aimed largely at fence sitters in Congress.""

If Rousseff is impeached, her vice president (who is, due to Brazil's system, from a different party) takes over. But the political damage done to the PT would likely be devastating. This would likely help another party win in 2018.

But parties across the political spectrum are involved in the scandal. That, together with the ongoing economic problems, might empower the rise of a previously weak or entirely new party.

""Look at politics in our country; the factors that allow [political] outsiders to come in are very strong around the world right now,"" Winter says. ""Think about how appealing an outsider might be in Brazil, where things are actually bad!""

There's another, even crazier way by which Petrobras could cost Rousseff her job.

If strong evidence surfaces that Rousseff's election campaigns were funded by dirty Petrobras money, which seems easily within the realm of possibility, a court could rule that election null and void. Winter suggests thinking about this possibility like a sports team forced to give back a championship title after a cheating scandal.

This procedure, called cassação, would create even more chaos than an impeachment.

If there's a cassação ruling, both Rousseff and her vice president would be forced out of office: After all, the VP was also elected at the same time. Cunha, the speaker of the house, would then take over. But remember, he's also being investigated on suspicion of involvement with Petrobras, and thus at risk of impeachment.

The Brazilian political system, then, is potentially nearing a point of real chaos. The president is facing impeachment and might be thrown out by the courts — which means she has substantially weakened power to pass new legislation to deal with Brazil's economic problems. Leading opposition figures, as well as former leaders, are also in serious trouble.

But it's worth remembering the reason the political chaos happened in the first place: A government investigation uncovered and stopped the biggest corruption scandal in the history of modern democracy.

This isn't just a one-off accomplishment. The investigations of leading politicians like Lula, and the conviction of leading businesspeople like Odebrecht, may signal that Brazil's centuries of impunity are finally coming to an end.

""If you were trying to decide on material grounds whether the costs of corruption outweighed the benefits [before Petrobras],"" Taylor says, ""you would fall — easily — onto the side of becoming corrupt.""

But the Petrobras investigation, and the broader anti-corruption effort it represents, ""have changed that calculus,"" he says. That makes it, in his words, ""momentous.""",corruption scandal

The Frankfurt headquarters of Deutsche Bank have been raided by prosecutors in a money laundering investigation.

Germany's public prosecutor alleged that two staff members have helped clients launder money from criminal activities.

Police cars were seen outside the tower blocks that house the headquarters of Germany's biggest bank.

Five other Deutsche offices in the city were searched in an operation involving about 170 police and officials.

Prosecutors are looking into whether Deutsche Bank staff helped clients set up offshore accounts to ""transfer money from criminal activities"".

The investigation, which began in August, focuses on activities between 2013 and the start of 2018.

In 2016 alone, more than 900 customers were served by a Deutsche Bank subsidiary registered in the British Virgin Islands, generating a volume of €311m, the prosecutors allege.

The investigation was sparked by revelations in the 2016 ""Panama Papers"" - an enormous amount of information leaked from a Panamanian law firm called Mossack Fonseca.

What are the Panama Papers?

Other banks have been fined as a result of information contained in the Panama Papers.

Deutsche shares fell 3% after news of the raid emerged. The bank confirmed that police had raided several locations in Germany and that it was co-operating fully with the probe.

Paperwork and electronic documents were seized by officials during the raids on the bank's properties.

Deutsche has been connected with another huge money laundering scandal at Denmark's Danske Bank.

Earlier this month, Deutsche confirmed that it was involved in processing payments for the Danish bank in Estonia.

An internal investigation by Danske found that about €200bn (£177bn) of payments were funnelled through its Estonian branch.

The Danish bank said many of those payments were suspicious.

Deutsche said it had terminated its relationship with Danske in 2015 after ""identifying suspicious activity"".

Fines and sanctions

Deutsche Bank has been sanctioned in the past for failing to tackle money laundering.

In September, Germany's financial regulator ordered the bank to take further action to prevent money laundering and terrorism financing.

It also appointed an independent auditor to monitor Deutsche Bank's efforts over three years.

In 2017, Deutsche Bank was fined $630m (£504m) by US and UK regulators in connection with a Russian money laundering plan.

Under the scheme, clients illegally moved $10bn out of Russia via shares bought and sold through the bank's Moscow, London and New York offices.

The trouble with authorities comes at a time when Deutsche continued to face problems with its business.

Pre-tax profits for the three months to September fell 45% to €506m compared with the same period last year.

WARSAW, May 26 (Reuters) - Polish prosecutors have started an investigation into suspected money laundering at a small state-controlled lender BOS Bank, Dziennik Gazeta Prawna daily said on Tuesday, quoting an unnamed source.

The regional prosecutor’s office in Katowice in southern Poland said in an emailed statement to Reuters: “An investigation has been initiated in the local prosecutor’s office regarding irregularities in connection with transactions carried out on bank accounts for selected foreign entities at one of the banks.” The prosecutor’s office did not give further details.

BOS Bank said in a statement on Tuesday that it complies with all anti-money laundering regulations and cooperates with authorities. A BOS Bank spokeswoman declined to comment further.

A spokesman for Poland’s financial sector regulator KNF declined to comment.

BOS Bank shares were down 1.1% by 1213 GMT, underperforming the Polish stock market’s banking index which was up 2.9%

Poland’s ruling nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) party has highlighted the country’s success at fighting tax avoidance schemes, but money laundering is rarely a part of public debate.

Poland ranks at 102 out of 125 in a 2019 ranking of countries with highest risk of money laundering compiled by the Basel Institute of Governance. Poland’s ranking indicates that the risk of money laundering in the country is relatively low.

Preventing money laundering has become an increasing focus for regulators in Europe after Estonia became the centre of a major money-laundering scandal in 2017.

The European Union is looking at how to strengthen its scrutiny of the financial sector after a spate of scandals in Estonia, Malta, Latvia, Cyprus and the Netherlands exposed how national watchdogs were slow to take action against banks who abetted or did not prevent money laundering.

The UN’s housing advisor has accused private equity firms and one of the world’s largest corporate residential landlords, Blackstone Group, of exploiting tenants, “wreaking havoc” in communities and helping to fuel a global housing crisis.

In a stinging critique of the role of private equity in the housing market UN rapporteur Leilani Farha and co-author Surya Deva, chairperson of the UN Working Group, singled out Blackstone’s business practices – which they claim include massively inflating rents and imposing an array of heavy fees and charges for ordinary repairs – as having “devastating consequences” for many tenants in countries around the world.

In a series of letters to Blackstone and government officials in Czech Republic, Denmark, Ireland, Spain, Sweden and the US, Farha and Deva accused private equity and asset management firms like Blackstone and its subsidiaries of undertaking “aggressive evictions” to protect its rental income streams, shrinking the pool of affordable housing in some areas, and effectively pushing low and middle-income tenants from their homes.

Blackstone disputed the claims. In a letter to Stephen Schwarzman, Blackstone’s founder and CEO, obtained by the Guardian, the company said the UN report contained “numerous false claims, significant factual errors and inaccurate conclusions”. And the company was “surprised and disappointed” that the UN would “send a communication without verifying your assertions and providing appropriate context”.

Blackstone has, in recent years, acquired hundreds of thousands of homes in the US, Europe, Asia and Latin America, often through subsidiaries, making it one of the largest and most powerful global players in the housing investment sector.

In its reply, Blackstone claimed private equity had helped build the rental market at a time when countries around the world were facing housing shortages and abided by all relevant locals laws.

Farha said the commodification of real estate by private equity investors in recent years had made housing for many people increasingly expensive and precarious: “Landlords have become faceless corporations wreaking havoc with tenants’ right to security and contributing to the global housing crisis.”

The authors also wrote formal letters to six countries, including the US, accusing them of failing to regulate corporate landlords and protect tenants’ human right to secure housing: “We remind all states that while gold is a commodity, housing is not, it’s a human right.”

The UN letter to the US government focuses on the way corporate landlords bought hundreds of thousands of ordinary family houses left empty after their owners defaulted on mortgage payments during the sub-prime crisis of 2008.

The firms were encouraged by US government agencies to acquire the heavily-discounted properties in part because they would bring homes back into use as local economies began to recover from the financial crash.

However, the need to maximize profits to repay investors typically led to a “constant escalation” of housing costs for tenants, primarily by hiking rents – in some cases by 30-50% – and ruthlessly pursuing eviction for non-payment. One corporation issued nearly a third of its tenants with eviction notices, the letter says.

The authors allege that a Blackstone subsidiary in the US, Invitation Homes, imposes charges for minor maintenance repairs and tasks such as removing insect infestations. She alleges that it imposes late rental payments of $100, even if they are just one minute late, or due to an error in Invitation Homes’ computer system.

In its reply, Blackstone said it was a small player in the US rental market, representing 0.5% of the nearly 16m single-family homes for rent in the United States, and that its customer satisfaction and retention rates were in fact higher than average.

Letters outlining similar breaches of housing rights and failure to regulate corporate landlords were also sent to Sweden, Czech Republic, Spain, Denmark and Republic of Ireland, each of which has seen large influxes of corporate rental investment in recent years.

Blackstone disputed these findings too.

Farha has made what she calls the “financialisation” of housing the priority of her tenure as housing rapporteur since 2014, highlighting how the transformation of real estate into an asset class traded on global markets has triggered housing insecurity and homelessness crises in many cities around the world.

A paper she published for the UN two years ago noted how trillions of dollars of investments in hyper expensive apartment blocks in neighbourhoods of major cities from London to Vancouver had put housing beyond the reach of all but the rich, breaking up established communities, and fuelling soaring rents and evictions.

Farha’s investigation into corporate landlords’ treatment of tenants around the world is the subject of a new documentary, Push, which premiered this month. A sub-plot of the film is Farha’s repeated but ultimately doomed attempts to secure a face-to-face meeting with chief executive Schwarzman to discuss its role.","exploitation of tenants, immoral economic activity.no mention of keywords though"

Australian casino operator Crown Resorts has revealed it is being investigated for possible breaches of anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing laws.

The company told the Australian Stock Exchange it had been contacted by the country's financial crime regulator.

Crown has casinos in Melbourne and Perth, and is building one in Sydney.

If breaches are proven, it could face millions of dollars in fines and threats to its casino licences.

The company is already facing separate inquiries into its licences and questions over how it brought in high-roller gamblers, largely from China.

Last year, Nine Entertainment newspapers reported allegations that Crown Melbourne had business ties to tour operators with suspected crime links in Asia.

The regulator, Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (Austrac), is yet to comment on Monday's announcement or whether it is related to those allegations.

In a statement, Crown said Austrac had raised concerns after reviewing its Melbourne casino's ""management of customers identified as high risk and politically exposed persons"".

They included ""concerns in relation to ongoing customer due diligence"" and complying with ""an anti-money laundering/counter-terrorism financing programme"".

Crown added it would co-operate with the investigation. At one point on Monday, its shares were down by more than 9%.

U.S. Attorney William Hochul Jr. confirmed that the U.S. State Department has issued the designation for Abd Al-Ra’Ouf Abu Zaid Mohamed Hamza under Executive Order 13224, which targets terrorists and those providing support to terrorists or acts of terrorism.

Hamza and three co-conspirators participated in an armed attack in Khartoum, Sudan on January 1, 2008 which led to the death of Granville, who was serving as a U.S. Diplomat at the time. He was working on democracy and governance programs while serving with the U.S. Agency for International Development. A U.S. Embassy staff member was also killed in the attack.

“As the office that is leading the criminal investigation into this terrible crime, this is certainly welcome news,” Hochul said, of the designation. “This action puts the world on notice that anyone aiding this individual will, along with the defendant, eventually be brought to justice.”

The decision to issue the terrorist designation means two things. First, all property subject to U.S. jurisdiction in which Hamza has any interest is blocked and any assets he may have under U.S. jurisdiction are frozen. Additionally, American citizens are generally prohibited from engaging in transactions with a designated terrorist.

Hamza and his co-conspirators were convicted of murder and sentenced to death in a Sudanese criminal court in 2009. All four escaped from a maximum security prison the following year, killing a Sudanese police officer during the escape.

Estate agent group Countrywide has been hit with a £215,000 fine by HMRC for money-laundering failures.

The company was fined for failing to ensure that its money-laundering procedures and record-keeping were in line with regulations.

HMRC also made surprise visits to 50 estate agents in a week to crack down on money-laundering in the industry.

Countrywide told the BBC it has improved its anti-money laundering controls.

Economic Secretary John Glen said: ""I have zero tolerance for firms prepared to turn a blind eye to the law.""

Countrywide told the BBC it had ""conducted a full review of its anti-money laundering controls and has taken thorough measures to strengthen the processes that support and monitor compliance throughout the business.""

The changes include hiring and training more staff to monitor deals, it said in a statement.

The company is due to announce its 2018 results on Thursday.

The details of the fine are included in an HMRC list of businesses that have not complied with 2017 money-laundering regulations.

Other firms fined include the now-defunct online agency Tepilo, which was charged a £68,595 penalty.

Tax officers visited 50 estate agents across England after they were suspected of trading without being registered under the money-laundering regulations.

HMRC said it would now take action against businesses that failed to comply, although it has not named any of them.

However, 35 were in London, five in Leicester, four in Buckinghamshire and Berkshire combined, three in Greater Manchester and one in each in Watford, Wakefield and Wolverhampton.

An international firm has agreed to be fined almost £20,000 after accepting it failed to carry out due diligence on a string of foreign investor clients. Taylor Vinters LLP made a regulatory settlement agreement with the SRA after admitting four rule breaches under money laundering regulations.

According to the settlement, the firm acted from 2014 in 161 matters for 88 overseas nationals buying expensive off-plan property plots in London. By 2018, it had received around £16.8m into the client bank account but an employee or manager of the firm had met only half of the clients. In 17 matters, involving nine clients, money was received without any customer due diligence being undertaken: in 26 further matters the firm held some due diligence documents such as passports but had not still completed all the checks required.

Taylor Vinters stated that its client bank account details had been provided to clients without its knowledge. The firm did not know who had provided the clients with its bank details. Once the firm became aware, it informed clients not to send funds until the required customer due diligence had been completed.

It was found that the firm itself had assessed the money laundering risks of these matters as ‘high’ and so was required to conduct enhanced customer due diligence and ongoing monitoring. It implemented what it described as a ‘quadruple lock’ process of needing photo ID, confirmation of address, a copy of the client’s bank statement and an online check.

But in 43 of the matters it was found the firm failed to conduct adequate checks before funds were deposited and failed to do ongoing monitoring.

The SRA acknowledged, in terms of mitigation, that client account details were given out without the firm’s knowledge, and that the firm put in place processes to mitigate the identified breaches.

The regulator also noted that retrospective customer due diligence was made following receipt of the monies on all but one client, the misconduct had not been repeated since and the firm had assisted the SRA throughout the investigation. There was no reason to suspect that any dubious transactions, which bear the hallmarks of money laundering, had taken place either.

The £19,200 fine was calculated as 0.2% of the firm’s £16m turnover for the relevant period, discounted to take account of mitigation. Taylor Vinters will also pay £5,800 costs.",money laundering

A gold refiner that was used by criminals to launder drug money has been allowed to sell gold into global supply chains used to make smartphones and cars.

International investigators concluded that the Dubai-based trader Kaloti was buying gold from criminal networks.

The US Treasury was urged by law enforcement six years ago to warn the world that it was a ""primary money laundering concern"".

But the warning was never given.

As a result, Kaloti has continued to sell tonnes of gold to companies in the supply chains of Apple, General Motors and Amazon, which use the precious metal in components. This has put firms and millions of consumers at risk of unwittingly funding criminal activity.

The US Treasury did not respond to requests for comment.

Kaloti's representatives said it ""vehemently denied"" it was knowingly involved in any crime or misconduct.

'Honey Badger'

Confidential documents seen by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) and the BBC reveal the US Treasury was urged by investigators in 2014 to issue the warning after a three-year investigation.

Codenamed ""Honey Badger"" and led by the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), the investigation concluded that Kaloti was involved in a scheme to transport or transfer ""tremendous amounts of illicit value through the use of gold as a commodity"".

Under the scheme described in the documents, criminals anywhere in the world could use drug money or other unlawfully obtained cash to buy scrap gold such as second-hand jewellery and bring it to Kaloti.

In exchange for the gold, according to investigators, Kaloti would offer bulk cash or send a wire transfer to them.

In 2014, the DEA recommended that the US Treasury should publicly designate Kaloti a ""primary money laundering concern"" under the US Patriot Act, which would have made it too risky for global banks to do business with them, freezing the group out of the global financial system.

But the US Treasury never took action against Kaloti. Former officials said it put off a decision on the recommendation, concerned about the reaction of the United Arab Emirates, a key diplomatic ally, where Kaloti was based.

When the UAE failed to act on its own initiative, the investigation was shelved.

Suspicious activity

Kaloti did not have the chance to see or challenge any of the evidence as they were not questioned by investigators and there could be undisclosed reasons justifying why the report wasn't acted upon. Attempts to obtain an explanation from the US Treasury failed to draw a response.

The investigation, which the US government has never made public, was supported by a flood of reports of suspicious activity from banks across the world handling Kaloti's money.

Lenders including Deutsche Bank and Barclays submitted 34 separate reports about Kaloti to the US Treasury's Financial Crime Enforcement Network (FinCEN), highlighting as suspicious thousands of transactions from 2007 to 2015 totalling $9.3bn (£7.26bn).

In 2017 a money laundering gang was convicted in France of laundering the proceeds of drug sales all over Europe including the UK.

Last October, BBC Panorama revealed that a company controlled by the gang, Renade International, had sold $146m (£114m) of gold to Kaloti in 2012 alone - part of $5.2bn of gold purchases paid for with cash.

Kaloti vehemently denies ever acting improperly and says it has never been accused or contacted by any US authority about wrongdoing.

It says it performs full due diligence on all customers and suppliers.

Lawyers for the firm said it had successfully passed audits each year against all regulatory and legal standards.

Supply chain fears

The DEA-led taskforce investigating Kaloti submitted a report of their investigation and recommended the primary money laundering designation in August 2014.

But after the designation didn't materialise, gold sold by Kaloti has continued to end up in major supply chains.

Apple's list of approved suppliers includes entities which have purchased tonnes of gold from Kaloti, including Valcambi, one of the largest gold refiners in the world, based in Switzerland.

All modern smartphones feature components made with gold, which is a highly conductive metal.

This year the anti-corruption watchdog Global Witness reported that in 2018 and 2019, Valcambi purchased up to 20 tonnes of gold directly from Kaloti and a further 60 tonnes from a related entity.

A further report by the Tech Transparency Project listed two further Swiss refiners which had purchased gold from Kaloti and were also on Apple's list of suppliers.

Valcambi said it would not confirm or deny buying gold from Kaloti. The company said it only purchases gold from its suppliers ""where the company can fully ensure the identification of the origin of the gold"".

In a statement, Apple said it was committed to responsibly sourcing for its products: ""If a refiner is unable or unwilling to meet our standards, they will be removed from our supply chain. Since 2015, we've stopped working with 63 refiners of gold for this reason.

""Several thorough and independent reviews have been conducted since 2015, and there is no evidence that any gold from Kaloti enters Apple products.""

image copyrightGetty Images

Kaloti is listed as being in the supply chain for General Motors and Amazon, according to data submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission, the US regulator.

General Motors, which uses gold in car parts such as catalytic converters, said it was committed to responsible sourcing of goods used in its manufacturing and had not done business with Kaloti directly.

It said none of its suppliers had shared any compliance issues or concerns regarding Kaloti.

Amazon said it was ""committed to ensuring that the products and services we provide are produced in a way that respects human rights and the environment. We engage with suppliers that are committed to these same principles.

""We expect suppliers to support our effort to identify the origin of designated minerals used in our products.""

Investigators who had worked for years to expose money laundering linked to Kaloti describe themselves as ""incredibly frustrated"" by the US Treasury's handling of the matter.

""We put a tremendous amount of work and effort over three years into the case - we all lived and breathed it,"" said one of the people on the DEA-led taskforce, speaking anonymously.","""DEA recommended designating 'primary money laundering concern'"""
TMML2024031886676,Mallinckrodt Plc,"Alert ID: TMML2024031886676
On April 16, 2020, the New York Department of Financial Services (“DFS”) issued a Statement of Charges and Notice of Hearing against Irish pharmaceutical company Mallinckrodt plc and several of its U.S. subsidiaries (collectively, “Mallinckrodt”). [1] The administrative hearing will take place on August 24, 2020, before a hearing officer appointed by the DFS Superintendent. According to DFS, Mallinckrodt committed insurance fraud in violation of New York law by allegedly misrepresenting the efficacy and safety of opioids to patients and healthcare professionals, causing an over-prescription of its drugs, the cost of which was ultimately passed on to New York insurance companies and their policyholders.

This action follows Governor Cuomo’s announcement in September 2019 that DFS was “taking action” to seek fines and restitution from opioid manufacturers, distributors, and pharmacy benefit managers for the costs New Yorkers had shouldered for the “over-prescription of opioids, addiction treatment and treatment of other adverse health effects associated with opioid addiction.” [2]

DFS’s invocation of an insurance-fraud theory of liability represents “a new front against opioid makers” in New York [3] and a novel and aggressive use of the relevant statutory provisions. This action also gives further insight into Superintendent Lacewell’s approach to enforcement, showing DFS’s heightened focus in the areas of consumer protection and healthcare. Below, we discuss DFS’s key factual allegations and legal theories.

Factual Allegations

Mallinckrodt manufactures a variety of name-brand (e.g., Exalgo) and generic (e.g., Percocet) opioids, a class of painkillers derived from opium. [4] Beginning in the mid-to-late 1990s, DFS alleges, Mallinckrodt conducted “a deliberately false and misleading marketing and promotional campaign” designed to convince healthcare professionals and patients that the benefits of using opioids to treat chronic pain outweighed the risks, and that opioids could be safely used by most patients. [5] To that end, Mallinckrodt allegedly:

Developed and disseminated “seemingly truthful” scientific, educational, and marketing materials that misrepresented the safety and efficacy of long-term opioid use; [6]
Paid sales representatives to deliver misleading messages about opioids to healthcare professionals; [7]
Recruited and funded healthcare providers to draft misleading studies and present deceptive and misleading continuing medical education programs; [8]
Helped develop and fund “seemingly independent, objective” advocacy groups that developed false and misleading educational materials and treatment guidelines that promoted long-term opioid use; [9] and
Failed to identify, report, and halt suspicious orders of opioids and opioid diversion. [10]

The result of these promotional efforts, DFS asserts, was a “dramatic increase[]” in “medically necessary” prescriptions of opioid medications, and Mallinckrodt’s drugs in particular. [11] Between 2009 and 2019, Mallinckrodt allegedly supplied New York policyholders of private commercial health insurance with over 1 billion opioid pills. [12]

With this increase in opioid prescriptions, DFS alleges, came “debilitating” financial costs: “It is estimated that, just in the past 10 years, commercial health insurance companies in the State of New York (and ultimately the consumers who pay insurance premiums) have paid $1.8 billion in additional claims as a result of the opioid crisis.” [13]

DFS’s Legal Theories

Relying on its authority as “the sole insurance regulator in the State of New York” with the responsibility to investigate and “promote the reduction and elimination of fraud” with respect to insurance institutions and their customers, DFS charged that Mallinckrodt’s conduct contravened two New York statutes that prohibit insurance fraud and provide for civil penalties. [14]

A. Section 403 of the New York Insurance Law

Section 403 of the New York Insurance Law authorizes the DFS Superintendent to levy a civil penalty of up to $5,000 (plus the amount of the false claim) per commission against any person who has committed a “fraudulent insurance act” within the meaning of Section 176.05 of the Penal Law. [15] Section 176.05, in turn, defines a “fraudulent insurance act” as an act “committed by any person who, knowingly and with intent to defraud presents [or] causes to be presented . . . to or by an insurer . . . a claim for payment . . . that he or she knows to: (a) contain materially false information concerning any material fact thereto; or (b) conceal, for the purpose of misleading, information concerning any fact material thereto.” [16]

DFS’s allegation that Mallinckrodt committed “fraudulent insurance acts” appears to rely on the following causal chain: (i) Mallinckrodt’s alleged misrepresentations regarding the efficacy and safety of opioids; (ii) caused healthcare providers to write opioid prescriptions and file insurance claims for those prescriptions; and (iii) those insurance claims “carried with them” false representations that the prescribed opioids were medically necessary. [17]

In the alternative, DFS alleges that to the extent third parties (such as doctors who wrote fraudulent prescriptions) engaged in conduct that violated Section 176.05, Mallinckrodt is liable for such conduct because it “knowingly and with an intent to defraud, solicited, requested, commanded, importuned and/or intentionally aided such third parties in such conduct.” [18] Although DFS does not cite a statutory provision, this language appears to be drawn from the aiding and abetting offense in New York’s Penal Law. [19]

According to DFS, either theory of liability warrants a civil penalty of up to $5,000 (plus the amount of each claim) for each allegedly fraudulent prescription. [20]

DFS’s theory that Mallinckrodt instigated a third-party’s insurance fraud appears to constitute a novel use of Sections 403 and 176.05. The application of those provisions has been limited in the past to more direct causal theories. DFS has, for example, utilized Section 403 in guidance cautioning healthcare providers that the failure to collect co-payments without the insurer’s knowledge may constitute insurance fraud. [21] And the past prosecutions under Section 176.05 have primarily concerned the knowing submission by a provider or the insured of a false insurance claim. [22] Regarding DFS’s alternative theory, DFS provides no citation for its application of aiding-and-abetting principles to a Section 403 enforcement action.

B. Section 408 of the New York Financial Services Law

Section 408(a)(1)(A) of the New York Financial Services Law authorizes the DFS Superintendent to levy a civil penalty of up to $5,000 for the commission of any intentional fraud or intentional misrepresentation of a material fact “with respect to,” or involving any person offering to provide or providing, “financial products or services,” including commercial health insurance plans. [23]

DFS appears to be relying on a substantially similar causal chain as it did with the first theory described above. DFS appears to be arguing that because Mallinckrodt made alleged misrepresentations to healthcare providers and patients, and the healthcare providers in turn prescribed the opioids and filed claims with insurance companies, then Mallinckrodt’s statements are “with respect” to the insurance companies’ provision of insurance. Thus, whether Section 408 encompasses Mallinckrodt’s alleged conduct may turn on how broadly the phrase “with respect to” is interpreted, an issue with which courts have apparently not grappled. [24] Notably, DFS’s prior enforcement actions under Section 408 have primarily concerned misrepresentations made in connection with selling or providing financial products or services. [25]

Implications

Although a handful of similar insurance fraud actions have been filed elsewhere, [26] DFS’s enforcement action represents a “new front” against opioid manufacturers in New York. DFS’s legal theories—including their reliance on multi-step causal chains and, in one instance, aiding-and-abetting principles—represent a novel and aggressive application of New York law. As a result, should this action continue to be contested (it appears to be the first major administrative action—rather than a consent order—filed during Superintendent Lacewell’s tenure [27]) it would confront significant obstacles upon judicial review.

The action is also notable because Superintendent Lacewell has frequently highlighted consumer protection and healthcare as areas of focus, [28] and last year she undertook a reorganization to create a new “powerhouse” Consumer Protection and Financial Enforcement Division, led by Executive Deputy Superintendent Katherine Lemire. [29] The Mallinckrodt case may thus portend further aggressive enforcement in this space.",fraud

A British bank moved money that may have been linked to terrorist financing, leaked documents show.

Standard Chartered Bank processed almost $12m (£9.4m) in payments for Jordan's Arab Bank from 2014 to 2016.

In 2016, Standard Chartered filed a report alerting authorities to more than 900 transactions that it suspected might have been for ""illicit activities under the guise of charity"".

The report raised concerns about ""possible terrorist financing"".

The payments were reviewed after a US jury in 2014 found Arab Bank had knowingly provided banking services to the Palestinian militant group Hamas in the early 2000s.

The verdict was later overturned, but in 2015 the bank reached a settlement with 597 victims or the relatives of victims of 22 Hamas attacks in Israel.

In response to the leaked documents, Arab Bank stated that it ""abhors terrorism and does not support or encourage terrorist activities"".

Arab Bank said it was never notified by Standard Chartered that it had any concerns over transactions processed for its customers.

Standard Chartered said it took its responsibility to fight financial crime extremely seriously.

The leaked documents - known as the FinCEN files - were shared by BuzzFeed News with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) and BBC News Arabic.

What was Arab Bank accused of doing?

Arab Bank is one of the world's largest Arab banking networks, with 600 branches spread across five continents.

In 2015 it agreed to a settlement with the victims and relatives of Hamas attacks carried out in Israel between 2001 and 2004.

image copyrightAFP

The previous year, a US civil jury found that Arab Bank had knowingly provided banking services to leaders of the Palestinian militant group Hamas and charities it controlled. This verdict was later overturned as the judge had incorrectly instructed the jury.

The 10-year legal case produced evidence that Hamas had used the bank to move money and pay the families of suicide bombers in the early 2000s.

Gary Osen, a US lawyer who represented the victims in the US lawsuit against Arab Bank, told the BBC: ""A terrorist organisation… can't move the kind of money that an organisation like Hamas needs to operate. You need banking services, and Arab Bank was simply the largest and most convenient route.""

Hamas is regarded as a terrorist group by the US, Israel, the EU and several other nations due to its long record of attacks and its refusal to renounce violence.

In 2005, after an investigation by US regulators, Arab Bank was no longer authorised to process US dollar payments. It was also fined $24m for failing to adequately guard against money laundering and terrorist financing, and properly report suspicious activities.

What do the documents show?

Banks across the world rely on major Western banks like Standard Chartered to help them move money in US dollars. The service is known as correspondent banking.

The FinCEN files show that Standard Chartered began an investigation into US dollar payments that it had processed for Arab Bank after the 2014 trial.

image copyrightReuters

In early 2016, Standard Chartered issued a Suspicious Activity Report (SAR), which alerts authorities to potential instances of criminal activity, such as money laundering or terrorist financing.

The SAR highlighted more than 900 payments that Standard Chartered believed might have been for ""illicit activities under the guise of charity"".

The payments were labelled as ""charities"", ""donations"", ""support"" or ""gifts"", but ""a large majority"" of them were made ""by individuals who could not be verified in the public domain"", according to Standard Chartered's review.

Other payments triggered ""terrorism"" alerts. Some appeared to be intended for ""Specially Designated Nationals"" who were under US sanctions.

According to the SAR, the suspicious payments prompted Standard Chartered's New York branch to ""[exit] its relationship"" with Arab Bank in 2016.

What do the banks say?

Arab Bank said: ""In every country where it operates, Arab Bank is in good standing with government regulators and complies with anti-terrorism and money laundering laws. No government or regulator has ever found that accounts or transactions processed by Arab Bank violated anti-terrorism laws.""

It said many of the allegations ""date back nearly 20 years"", and that the vast majority of the accounts involved had no known terrorist links at the time.

Arab Bank added that it had never been notified by Standard Chartered that it had any concerns over transactions it processed for Arab Bank customers. Although Standard Chartered stopped processing US dollar payments for Arab Bank, it continued to maintain a very good business relationship with Standard Chartered, it said.

Standard Chartered said it ""initiated account closure"" with Arab Bank shortly after the 2014 court verdict but that it was a process that took some time.

It also said an SAR ""is not an admission of fault on the part of the bank, nor is it conclusive evidence that wrongdoing has taken place"".

""Only the proper authorities are in a position to make that determination.""

It added that it took its ""responsibility to fight financial crime extremely seriously"" and that it had ""invested substantially in compliance programmes"".

It had ""nearly 2,000 staff"" monitoring suspicious transactions, who last year ""monitored more than 1.2 billion transactions for potential suspicious activity"".

TMML2024032537695,Goldman Sachs,"Alert ID: TMML2024032537695
A subsidiary of Goldman Sachs pleaded guilty on Thursday and agreed to pay more than $2.9 billion in a foreign corruption probe tied to the Malaysian 1MDB sovereign wealth fund, which was looted of billions of dollars in a corruption scandal.

In addition, several current and former top executives at Goldman will have to return to the company millions of dollars in pay and bonuses they had pocketed in prior years, a financial penalty for those in charge after the scandal unfolded.

Goldman Sachs Malaysia entered the plea in federal court in Brooklyn. As part of its plea, the company admitted that it ""knowingly and willfully"" conspired to violate U.S. anti-bribery laws.

The $2.9 billion includes payments to U.S. and overseas regulators. The penalties also include roughly $600 million in profits Goldman made off the 1MDB scandal that it will have to return. Goldman had previously reached a $3.9 billion settlement with the government of Malaysia.

Goldman Sachs' board of directors decided to claw back pay and bonuses from top executives, including current CEO David Solomon and former CEO Lloyd Blankfein.

The Wall Street bank is in talks with additional executives to return part of their pay to the company over their role in the scheme, including Gary Cohn, as reported by the Wall Street Journal. Cohn became president and co-chief operating officer of Goldman Sachs 2006. He left the firm in 2017 to become a top economic adviser for the Trump administration. His payout from Goldman upon exiting was roughly $285 million. Cohn resigned from his role at the White House soon after in 2018.

Clawbacks are uncommon

In total, more than $174 million in pay and bonuses are being returned to the company, the board said. The penalty is more than many expected, as clawbacks are not all that common on Wall Street. Wells Fargo executives in the wake of the bank's phony account scandal, and JPMorgan bankers tied to London Whale trading losses, were also hit by clawbacks.

""The Board views the 1MDB matter as an institutional failure, inconsistent with the high expectations it has for the firm,"" Goldman's board said in a separate statement.

Malaysian and U.S. prosecutors had alleged that bond sales organized by Goldman Sachs provided one of the means for associates of former Prime Minister Najib Razak to steal billions over several years from a fund that was ostensibly set up to accelerate Malaysia's economic development.

""Sweeping international corruption scheme""

""Goldman Sachs participated in a sweeping international corruption scheme, conspiring to avail itself of more than $1.6 billion in bribes to multiple high-level government officials across several countries so that the company could reap hundreds of millions of dollars in fees, all to the detriment of the people of Malaysia and the reputation of American financial institutions operating abroad,"" said Acting U.S. Attorney Seth D. DuCharme of the Eastern District of New York, in prepared remarks.

In court on Thursday, Goldman Sachs' general counsel, Karen Seymour, said that agents and employees of Goldman Sachs Malaysia had violated the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act by ""corruptly promising and paying bribes to foreign officials in order to obtain and retain business for Goldman Sachs.""

The fund, 1Malaysia Development Berhad, or 1MBD, was set up in 2009 by Najib to promote economic development. It relied primarily on debt to fund investment and economic development projects and was overseen by senior Malaysian government officials, according to court records.

Najib set up 1MDB when he took office in 2009, but it accumulated billions in debts, and U.S. investigators allege at least $4.5 billion was stolen from the fund and laundered by his associates.

Public anger spurs election defeat

Public anger in Malaysia over the corruption allegations contributed to the shocking election defeat of Najib's long-ruling coalition in May 2018.

Two Goldman Sachs executives have also been personally charged for fraud. Tim Leissner, who was the chairman of Goldman's Southeast Asia division, pleaded guilty to money laundering and violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Another Goldman executive, Ng Chong Hwa, also known as ""Roger Ng,"" will stand trial for money laundering and violating the FCPA in March 2021.

""While it is abundantly clear that certain former employees broke the law, lied to our colleagues and circumvented firm controls, this fact does not relieve me or anyone else at the firm of our responsibility to recognize two critical realities,"" Solomon said in a statement.

The Department of Justice bought similar charges against Low Taek Jho, a Malaysian national with close relations to Malaysia's ruling party at the time who was the central player in the 1MDB fund. Jho lived a lavish lifestyle in New York, buying luxury goods and even a yacht. Jho's whereabouts are unknown, although he's believed to be somewhere in China and out of the reach of international authorities.",bribe

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States blacklisted four men and their companies based in Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates on Tuesday, for purported ties to an organization accused of laundering money for drug traffickers and Chinese, Colombian and Mexican crime groups.

Among them was Pakistani national Obaid Khanani, whose father Altaf Khanani was arrested by U.S. authorities in September 2015 and accused by the U.S. Treasury Department of laundering billions of dollars for the Taliban and other groups.

The department said in a statement that Obaid Khanani, 29, continued to help lead his father’s money laundering organization after the arrest. Altaf Khanani is set to be tried on money laundering charges in Miami this month, according to federal court records.

Another man on the list, Hozaifa Khanani, also 29, is Altaf Khanani’s nephew and was involved in real estate investments on behalf of his uncle’s organization, the Treasury Department said. Muhammad Javed Khanani, Altaf Khanani’s brother, was “heavily involved in laundering criminal proceeds via money service businesses” Treasury said. It said a fourth man, Atif Polani, helped move funds on behalf of Khanani’s organization.

The sanctions block any assets the men or companies might have had in the United States, and bars Americans from dealing with them.

“Treasury remains committed to combating illicit money laundering networks around the world and today’s action is the result of close coordination with our partners in the United Arab Emirates,” said John E. Smith, acting director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control, which imposes sanctions.

The department also blacklisted several businesses based in Pakistan and Dubai for either being owned by the men or being linked to money laundering.","Sanctions, Money Laundering, multiple people"

Uganda and Burundi have been explicitly mentioned in the case of 25 people, all members of ‘P5’, a coalition of groups fighting the Rwandan government, who were arrested in Democratic Republic Congo (DRC) and handed over to Rwanda earlier this year.

During the case which opened in the Military Tribunal in Nyamirambo, Prosecutors, based on statements of the suspects did not mince words in mentioning the role of the Ugandan and Burundian authorities in supporting P5 whose mission is allegedly to overthrow the Rwandan government.

The Military Prosecutor Maj. Denis Ruyonza told the tribunal that it is important to take note of the role of the governments of Uganda and Burundi which the suspects said firmly supported their activities by facilitating their movement, military training and arming them.

“When you read the written statements made by the suspects, one thing keeps coming up, the support by the Ugandan government. This court must carefully examine the active role of Ugandan authorities and security agencies in supporting this group,”

“From facilitating their recruitment to protecting people under the guise of protecting refugees and facilitating their smooth movement from one location to another, as was the case of Maj (Rtd) Habib Mudasir and Capt. Sibo Charles,” the Prosecutors said.

Military Prosecutors said Uganda’s intelligence agency Chieftaincy of Military Intelligence (CMI) facilitated the movement of Mudasir and Sibo, first from a protection camp in the north-western district of Arua, to Mbarara from where they were facilitated to cross over to Tanzania and then Burundi.

Court heard that a one Capt Johnson of CMI oversaw the transfer of the two men from Arua where they were allegedly living in a refugee protection camp to the western town of Mbarara from where they connected to Tanzania and using fake documents provided by Capt. Johnson, crossed into Burundi back in 2017.

In Burundi, the two men who were allegedly operating on the orders of Rwanda National Congress’ Kayumba Nyamwasa and Robert Higiro, oversaw the recruitment of young men into the P5 outfit and their subsequent transfer to South Kivu where they underwent military training.

Appearing unfazed, the injured Mudasir, a retired Rwanda Defence Force (RDF) Major, listened on as Prosecutors laid bare the details of how each of the 25 people was recruited into P5 and how they eventually ended up in DRC from where they were captured by Government forces FARDC and handed over to Rwanda.

In a court session that lasted for more than six hours, Prosecutors said that the involvement of Ugandan and Burundian authorities and security agencies in the creation and facilitating of P5, whose activities and presence in DRC was documented by the United Nations Group of Experts, is in no doubt.

“It did not stop at facilitating recruitment. As we heard today, this group contains three Ugandans namely Sulaiman Lubwama, Joseph Katwerere and Deziderio Fred, who have confessed to joining the group with the promise that they would overthrow the government of Rwanda,” Maj. Ruyonza said.

“They all agree on one thing, that the Government of Uganda and Rwandans living in Uganda who are members of P5 had promised them support to overthrow the Rwandan government through an armed struggle,” the Prosecutor said.

On Burundi, Prosecutors said that all the suspects confirmed that Burundian authorities, mainly the military intelligence agency, facilitated them directly, welcoming them into the country and hosting them at a hotel identified as “Transit Hotel”.

From here they would be briefed and handed military fatigues and boots before being transported by boat through L. Tanganyika to DRC, particularly to their bases in Bijabo, Minembwe, Masisi enroute to North Kivu from where they would be given military training in preparation to attack Rwanda.

In DRC, the groups of young men would be welcomed by Maj (Rtd) Mudasir, alias Musa, a one Ali and Richard Mateeka, a son of a retired Ugandan Major General John Mateeka, according to Prosecutors.

According to Prosecutors, in Burundi, the recruits would be welcomed by Col. Ignace Sibomana, the head of the military intelligence unit known as J2 and another officer identified as Maj. Bertin, who is the head of external intelligence, who would brief them on the mission at hand.

“They facilitated them and met them very often, together with another high ranking officer identified as Col. Nyamusaraba. They met under a group known as Ngomino for regular briefings. They received clothes, boots and guns. All this goes to show the role of Burundian agencies,” the Prosecutor said.

Court heard that even when some of the recruits would be arrested by other security agencies, the military officers would make sure they are released, adding that Burundi authorities ensured the smooth movement of recruits not only within the country but their safe transfer to camps in DRC.

Among the 25 are Burundian citizens namely Jean de Dieu Ndirahira, Jean Bosco Minani and Nsabimana Jean Marie Vianney who had joined the rebel group.

Out of the 25 people, 14 were recruited in Burundi, 8 from Uganda, 2 from Kenya and 1 from Malawi. According to Prosecutors, the group got a thorough briefing on April 10, 2019 on the planned attacks on the Rwandan territory, moving from South to North Kivu from where they would launch attacks.

A couple of weeks later in May, the P5 forces fell into an ambush of Congolese government forces who were on the hunt of negative groups in the area. The group was heavily shelled, dozens of the fighters getting killed in the process while the 25 were captured and later handed over to Rwanda.

Prosecutors revealed that the group is being tried in a military court because the case involves military individuals, naming a one Private Dieudonne Muhire as one of the suspects in the case. They also explained that foreigners are being tried in Rwanda because they conspired with nationals to commit crimes.

They will face charges including formation or joining of an irregular armed group, which is provided by Article 200 of the law determining offences and penalties and conspiracy against the established Government or the President of the Republic, which is stipulated in Article 202.

They are also facing the charge of maintaining relations with a foreign government with intent to wage a war, a crime which is punishable under Art. 193. The formation of or joining a criminal association is punishable under article 224.

The accused did not enter plea due to time Prosecutors spent talking. The case was adjourned to Tomorrow Thursday 9am.

Masoud Dalvand (Freedom Star): In order to know more about the terrorist activities of the Iranian regime in the region of the Middle East and in the whole world, in addition to missile activities and support for militias and terrorist groups, the seemingly economic and commercial activities of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) must be carefully considered.

The IRGC intervenes like an octopus in all security, political, military, social, Internet and economic sectors, because it protects the dictatorship of the mullahs from overthrow by the Iranian people.

Most of the major oil and economic projects in Iran are under the control of this terrorist and corrupt force. Money from economic activities by the IRGC is spent on missile projects and the continuation of proxy wars in Syria, Yemen, Iraq, Lebanon and Afghanistan, and the repression of uprisings of the Iranian people inside the country.

An important part of these funds is also paid to the accounts of the senior IRGC commanders because they are all corrupt and thieves. In one word, the IRGC is a corrupt mafia of assassinations and crimes in Iran, the Middle East and the entire world.

One of the companies owned by this terrorist force, is Mahan Air (an airlines company), which was recently banned by Germany and the United States. This so-called airline has its main task of sending weapons and militias and members of the IRGC to Syria to continue the war and protect the bloodthirsty dictatorship of Bashar al-Assad.

The following article provides readers with information on this airline owned by the IRGC’s terrorist force. I invite you to read this article. Published on the official website of the People’s Mojahedin Organization of Iran (PMOI/MEK).

A look at Mahan Air, the IRGC-owned Iranian airline spreading death and destruction

Jan. 28, 2019 – Just a few days ago, Germany announced that Iranian airline Mahan Air is no longer allowed to enter German airspace. In response, the Iranian regime’s minister of roads and urban development Mohammad Eslami said, “All the companies and airline industry of the Islamic Republic are sanctioned, and Mahan Air is among them.”

On January 21, Reuters quoted German sources that Mahan Air’s license for flying to German has been canceled. According to Reuters, the German federal government cited “safety problems” and the possibility of Iranian use of Mahan Air for “military purposes” as the reasons for its decision.

In a January 21 meeting between EU foreign ministers, German FM Heiko Maas said that Iranian Mahan Air transports weapons and soldiers to war-torn areas in Syria.

In a separate statement, German foreign ministry announced, “this decision has been taken in light of the recent sanctions agreed upon by the EU Council after the [terroristic] developments in France and Denmark.”

In June last year, the Iranian intelligence ministry plotted a failed attempt to plant a bomb in a grand gathering by the Iranian Resistance. At least three Iranians were arrested in connection with the attack, one of them an Iranian diplomat named Asadollah Assadi, from the Iranian regime’s embassy in Vienna, Austria.

Considering the recent developments, the foreign commission of the National Council of Resistance of Iran published a detailed report of Mahan Airs past record and its connections with the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC).

Mahan Air, while registered as a private company, has had vast links to the highest levels of Iranian officials from day one and has benefited a semi-official status of state-sponsorship throughout its life.

The Mola Almowaheddin institute, which describes itself as a charity, owns 100 percent of Mahan Air’s stock.

Mahan Air was founded in the city of Kerman, the capital of Kerman province in Iran. Mahan is the name of a small city 35 kilometers from Kerman. Ata’ollah Mohajerani, the minister of culture and guidance during the presidency of Mohammad Khatami, chose the name for Mahan Air.

Mahan Air was founded shortly after the Quds Force, IRGC’s foreign terrorist arm, was established.

Virtually all Mahan Air’s decision makers and major players are members of the IRGC and commanders of Qassem Soleimani’s Quds Force. A short list of some of them follows:

Hamid Arabnejad, chairman and CEO of Mahan Air, is a very close friend to Qassem Soleimani
Hamid Aslani, currently advisor to Hamid Arabnejad, is a Brigadier general of the IRGC. He is a former member of IRGC’s SWAT teams and later became head of the human resources in IRGC. At the same time, he became the HR head of Mahan Air.
Hamid Asgari, heads Mahan Air’s catering through a company named Arman. Formerly, he was one of the commanders of IRGC’s 41 st division, known as the Tharallah Division. He is close to Qassem Soleimani.

Through connections in the highest levels of Iraq’s government, particularly Hadi Al-Amiri, former Iraqi minister of transportation and head of the Badr Organization, Qassem Soleimani organized Mahan Air’s flights over Iraqi airspace to transport weapons and equipment to Syria.

On a daily basis, Mahan Air conducts flights from Tehran, Mashhad, Isfahan, Shiraz, and Abadan to Damascus over Iraq to transport weapons, equipment and fighters to aid the regime of Bashar al-Assad.

In groups of approximately 200 individuals each, Mahan Air transports militias, including Afghan nationals who have been hired by IRGC, to Damascus.

Iraqi militias affiliated with the Quds Force, are transported from Iraq’s Basra to Iran’s Abadan by bus, and from there flown to Damascus by Mahan Air.","Sanctions, Terrorism, Multiple people"

Mostafa Mahamed (born 14 February 1984, Port Said, Egypt), [1] known as Sheikh Abu Sulayman al-Muhajir (or Mostafa Farag) [2] is an Egyptian-born Australian Muslim who is a senior member of al-Qaeda 's Al Nusra Front. He is a 32-year-old from Sydney's southern suburbs now living in Syria. He is believed to be the highest ranking Australian member of al-Qaeda. [3]

Abu Sulayman was born Mostafa Mohamed in Egypt and migrated with his family to Australia soon after his birth. In 1985, he was granted an Australian passport. He was raised in Sydney 's predominantly Anglophone southern suburbs and was reportedly the only Muslim at his primary school. [3]

Abu Sulayman reportedly was devoted to Islam from early in his life and set up the first students' Islamic society at his school. [3]

He later became a preacher in Bankstown in Sydney's Western Suburbs, at the now defunct Al-Risalah centre. [4] [5]

Islamist militancy[ edit ]

By the early 2000s, he was associated with a small group of fundamentalists within Sydney's Muslim community. In 2003, those associations brought him to the attention of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. He was approached by ASIO officers and asked to provide information about a small group of Sydney men he knew, but he refused. Two years later those men were arrested in Operation Pendennis. He was seen appearing at court to support some of the men, who were convicted of planning terrorism. [3]

Abu Sulayman was also close to Bilal Khazal, an Al-Qaeda member who had travelled to Afghanistan and met Osama bin Laden. This supports what is commonly supposed, that he was associated with Al-Qaeda long before his travel to Syria. When Khazal returned to Australia he became a key facilitator for Australians who wanted to join Al Qaeda. He was also an associate of Houssam Sabbagh, a Lebanese al-Qaeda leader in Tripoli, Lebanon who lived in Sydney from 1989 to 2005. [3]

Move to Syria[ edit ]

Abu Sulayman arrived in Syria in late 2012 and soon after was appointed as one of the most senior religious scholars within Jabhat al-Nusra. [3]

According to The Australian, Abu Sulayman was threatened by Australian Jihadist Khaled Sharrouf. [6]

Sulayman reportedly has three children and a wife, whom he left behind in Sydney. [5]

US and Australian sanctions[ edit ]

In May 2016, the United States declared Abu Sulayman a ""Specially Designated Global Terrorist."" [3] However, The Australian reported that Abu Sulayman was put on a US ""kill list"" a few years before. [6]

In August 2015, Foreign Minister Julie Bishop included Abu Sulayman on Australia's counter-terrorism sanctions list. In a statement released by the Australian Foreign Minister's office, Bishop maintains that Abu Sulayman has solicited funds to finance Al-Nusrah Front's terrorist activities and has recruited Australians to travel to Syria to join the ""terror "".

PHOENIX - Drug Enforcement (DEA) Special Agent in Charge Doug Coleman announced today the unsealing of an indictment against Jose Guadalupe Tapia-Quintero, 42, a Mexican national and high ranking member of the Sinaloa Cartel. Tapia-Quintero was indicted by a federal grand jury in February 2013 on various counts including Conspiracy to Distribute Methamphetamine with Intent to Import, Conspiracy to Possess with the Intent to Distribute Methamphetamine and Conspiracy to Commit Concealment Money Laundering.

“Our strategy of targeting the highest level of the Sinaloa Cartel continues to pay off,” said DEA Special Agent in Charge Doug Coleman. “DEA and our law enforcement partners on both sides of the border remain committed to using every law enforcement tool to attack these criminal organizations so they are put out of business, and their leaders are brought to justice.”

Jose Guadalupe Tapia-Quintero, aka “Lupe”, is a resident of Sinaloa, Mexico and owned various businesses including bus and tractor-trailer companies in Mexico. As a transportation coordinator for the powerful Sinaloa Cartel, Tapia Quintero used his businesses to move large quantities of methamphetamine at a time from the interior of Mexico to the U.S/Mexico border including Arizona.

Tapia-Quintero, a trusted ally of the Sinaloa Cartel, controlled key drug distribution routes from Sinaloa, Mexico to destination points along the Southwest Border

In total, the long term investigation has resulted in seizure of 148.5 pounds of Methamphetamine; 30 kilograms of Cocaine; over $770,000; and three arrests.
The investigation preceding the indictment was led by the DEA Phoenix OCDETF Strike Force and IRS Criminal Investigation with the assistance of the DEA Special Operations Division, Scottsdale Police Department and the Arizona Department of Public Safety.

The DEA Phoenix OCDETF Strike Force brings a synergy to drug trafficking investigations by combining, side-by-side, the resources and expertise of all participating investigative agents and prosecutors. By coordinating their efforts in that way, OCDETF Strike Force has achieved great success against the major Mexican cartels.

An indictment is simply a method by which a person is charged with criminal activity and raises no inference on guilt. An individual is presumed innocent until competent evidence is presented to a jury that established guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.","Cartel, Money Laundering, Narcotics"

MANILA, Philippines–An Iranian national arrested by the National Bureau of Investigation on the request of the US Department of Justice after he was indicted in a US court for being part of a conspiracy to smuggle to Iran about 20 tons of specialized steel “with nuclear applications” died Monday evening of cardiac arrest, an NBI official said.

The US justice department told the NBI the Iranian was indicted in the District Court of Columbia for being part of a conspiracy to smuggle to Iran about 20 tons of specialized steel “with nuclear applications” which were considered suitable for gas centrifuges used in uranium enrichment.

Records showed Khaki was also charged by the US justice department with money laundering and violating US laws with respect to the American embargo against Iran.

NBI records showed the Iranian was on his way back to Iran when he was arrested by NBI agents at Naia Terminal 1 on May 26, 2012.

Khaki’s extradition to the US did not push through, however, after the Iranian Embassy filed a petition in Manila Regional Trial Court Branch 21 opposing his extradition.

The Iranian remained in NBI custody while his extradition case was pending in the Manila court.

NBI foreign liaison chief Daniel Daganzo said Khaki suffered a heart attack around 8 p.m. on Monday and was rushed to the Manila Doctors Hospital but he succumbed around 11 p.m.

He said that with the death, Khaki’s case would now be handled by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Department of Justice.

In this Spanish name, the first or paternal family name is Oseguera and the second or maternal family name is Cervantes.

Antonio Oseguera Cervantes (Spanish pronunciation: [an'tonio ose'ɣera θeɾˈβantes]; born 20 August 1958) is a Mexican suspected drug lord and former high-ranking leader of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG), a criminal group based in Jalisco. His brother is Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes (alias ""El Mencho""), the leader of the CJNG and one of Mexico's most-wanted drug lords. In Mexico, he was formally charged in 2015 for drug trafficking and being in possession of military-exclusive firearms.

On 3 December 2015, Oseguera Cervantes was arrested while driving in Tlajomulco, Jalisco. He was imprisoned at the Federal Social Readaptation Center No. 11, a maximum-security prison in Sonora. The following year, the United States Department of the Treasury sanctioned him under the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act for providing financial and material assistance to the CJNG. A judge later released him from prison after determining that there were violations in his due process.

Early life and career[ edit ]

Antonio Oseguera Cervantes was born on 10 August 1958, in Aguililla, Michoacán, Mexico. [1] He uses another formal name, Joel Mora Garibay, [2] and often goes by his alias "" Tony Montana"". [3] He reportedly has five brothers: Nemesio, Juan, Miguel, Marín, and Abraham. [4] His criminal background dates back to the 1990s. In 1996, Oseguera Cervantes was arrested for heroin charges in the U.S. and deported to Mexico, where he renewed his drug trafficking activities. [5] Several of his siblings were also accused of heroin distribution or other crimes in the U.S. that decade. [6] [7] In 2001, Oseguera Cervantes was released from a prison in Mississippi after being convicted for property damage. [a] [9]

His brother Nemesio (alias ""El Mencho"") is the leader of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG) and one of Mexico's most-wanted drug lords. [10] Under his sibling, Oseguera Cervantes was responsible for supervising the buying and selling of firearms for the CJNG. He was also responsible for managing money laundering schemes and passing on information of law enforcement activities to the CJNG. [6] [11] According to Mexican security forces, he mostly coordinated the CJNG operations while based in the Guadalajara Metropolitan Area. [12]

On 27 October 2016, the United States Department of the Treasury sanctioned nine Mexican nationals, including Oseguera Cervantes, under the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act (also known as the ""Kingpin Act"") for their alleged involvement in money laundering and/or international drug trafficking. [13] They were accused of providing financial and material assistance to his brother Nemesio and his in-law Abigael González Valencia (alias ""El Cuini""), the two leaders of the CJNG and Los Cuinis. [b] As a result of this sanction, Oseguera Cervantes' assets in the U.S. were frozen and U.S. citizens were prohibited from carrying out transactions with him; the other individuals sanctioned were Julio Alberto Castillo Rodríguez; González Valencia clan members Arnulfo, Édgar Edén, Marisa Ivette, Noemi, and Elvis; businessman Fabián Felipe Vera López and attorney María Teresa Quintana Navarro. [15]

On 3 December 2015, Oseguera Cervantes was driving in Tlajomulco, Jalisco, when he noticed the presence of the Federal Police and the Mexican Army. [16] [17] As he tried to avoid passing through them at a checkpoint near his home, the officers ordered him to stop. [c] [19] The police had followed his tracks for six months and knew that he was trying to live under a low profile to avoid the detection of law enforcement. Oseguera Cervantes was driving a 2010 Volkswagen Jetta, was not accompanied by a bodyguard, and claimed to be a clothing merchant. [20] He identified himself using an ID with his other alias, Joel Mora Garibay. [8] The police arrested him and seized his vehicle, two assault rifles, a handgun, and a package with an undisclosed amount of narcotics. [d] [23] The Federal Police chief Enrique Francisco Galindo Ceballos [ es ] confirmed his arrest the following day in a press conference. [24] He stated that Oseguera Cervantes was a high-ranking leader of the CJNG and that his arrest was a major blow to the group's financial circle. [25]

On 4 December, he was transferred to Mexico City and sent to the SEIDO installations, Mexico's anti-organized crime investigatory agency, for his legal declaration. [26] On 7 December, he was sent to the Federal Social Readaptation Center No. 11, a maximum-security prison in Hermosillo, Sonora. The Office of the General Prosecutor (PGR) confirmed that he was charged with drug trafficking and possession of military-exclusive firearms. [27] A federal court in Jalisco confirmed the charges on 15 December after it concluded that the PGR provided sufficient evidences against him. The court also specified that Oseguera Cervantes was found in possession of methamphetamine (1000.1 grams) with intent to distribute. [28]

On 18 December, Oseguera Cervantes' defense issued a writ of amparo to an appeal court in Mexico City and requested them to remove his charges. The court investigated the injuries he had after he was arrested, and analyzed whether he was tortured to confess or if they were a result of him resisting arrest. The court struck the injunction after it considered that the charges against him were serious in nature and that the arrest was lawful. [29]

On 15 July 2016, an appeal court in Jalisco granted Oseguera Cervantes a writ of amparo after it discovered that he was formally charged with drug trafficking and possession of military-exclusive weapons without a required signature by a judge in one of the documents used in the case. [30] The unsigned court document contained information about fingerprint evidence that linked Oseguera Cervantes to the weapons and drugs seized at the moment of his arrest. It also included information of the defense's vehicle and his mental and behavioral exams conducted by criminal investigators. The appeal court stated that the lack of signature affected Oseguera Cervantes' legal representation and thus constituted a violation in the legal process. This pushed back the case against Oseguera Cervantes to its initial stages. [31] He was later released from prison after a judge considered that there were violations in his due process. [32]

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. admitted its role in the biggest foreign bribery case in U.S. enforcement history, reaching multiple international settlements to end probes into its fundraising for the scandal-plagued Malaysian fund known as 1MDB.

Goldman officials helped spread $1.6 billion in illicit payments across Malaysia and the Middle East as part of a scheme that diverted money raised for development projects into an international spending spree on mansions and lavish parties, the bank said.

The bank agreed to billions of dollars in new penalties to the Justice Department and other U.S. authorities, as well as to regulators in the U.K., Hong Kong and Singapore. The payments brought its overall tab to more than $5 billion to resolve probes into bond deals it arranged for 1MDB.

The Wall Street giant will cut the pay of Chief Executive Officer David Solomon and other current leaders and claw back compensation from his predecessor Lloyd Blankfein and several other former executives, the bank said Thursday.

A small Malaysian unit of the U.S. bank pleaded guilty to a single conspiracy charge on Thursday. But Goldman’s parent company avoided a criminal conviction to resolve the investigations, as part a deal that allows the bank to put off any prosecution as long as it cooperates with ongoing U.S. investigations and submits compliance reports.

The deferred-prosecution agreement is a win for Goldman Sachs, because a conviction might have risked losing some institutional clients that are restricted from working with financial firms with criminal records. The bank’s shares rose 1.2% on Thursday.

The global resolutions announced Thursday conclude more than a half decade of investigations into Goldman’s role in raising $6.5 billion for 1MDB in three bond offerings. To smooth the way for those bond deals, Goldman officials conspired with a 1MDB official to bribe Malaysian officials and officials of a sovereign wealth vehicle in Abu Dhabi, the U.S. Justice Department said.

U.S. authorities said that Goldman’s misconduct rose to the bank’s highest ranks, despite its insistence for years that rogue employees were responsible. “The scheme was principally carried out by senior officials in Goldman,” Acting U.S. Attorney Seth DuCharme said.

In all, some $2.7 billion of the money raised for 1MDB was stolen by people connected to the country’s former prime minister and diverted for bribes, a luxury yacht, fine art and even funding for the Hollywood movie “The Wolf of Wall Street.”

The Justice Department settlement concludes one of the biggest bank probes inherited by the Trump administration. The bank will pay more than $2.3 billion in the plea deal, U.S. prosecutor Alixandra Smith said, the largest penalty in U.S. history for a violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Airbus SE paid $2.09 billion earlier this year to settle global bribery probes.

The case against the Wall Street firm focused on its fundraising work in 2012 and 2013 for the state-owned 1MDB, formally known as 1Malaysia Development Bhd. From about 2009 to 2014, the bank’s Malaysia unit “knowingly and willfully agreed to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act by corruptly promising, and paying bribes to foreign officials in order to obtain and retain business for Goldman Sachs,” the bank’s general counsel, Karen Seymour, told U.S. District Judge Margo Brodie in Brooklyn in a video hearing on Thursday.

Goldman’s investment-banking group, led at the time by Solomon, collected $600 million from the bond sales.

Prosecutors in court filings described a corporate culture at Goldman that displayed a casual indifference to bribery, at least among a few senior executives.

In a statement of facts accepted by Goldman, prosecutors highlighted a call in which a managing director discussed with a senior executive problems the bank was having in securing an investment from an Abu Dhabi investment fund related to 1MDB.

The managing director said it was clear that a government official in Abu Dhabi was “trying to get something on the side in his pocket” from the deal. “I think it’s quite disturbing to have come across this piece of information,” he added.

“What’s disturbing about that?” the senior executive replied, according to the filing, which didn’t identify the individuals. “It’s nothing new, is it?”

The suspected mastermind of the 1MDB fraud, a Malaysian financier known as Jho Low, conspired with bankers Tim Leissner, Roger Ng and others to bribe high-ranking officials in Abu Dhabi’s state-owned and state-controlled sovereign wealth fund, International Petroleum Investment Company, and a unit, Aabar Investments PJS, the bank admitted. IPIC agreed to be a guarantor of a 2012 1MDB debt deal, a role that helped the bond offering move ahead.

Bribes also went to the Malaysian government and 1MDB officials, prosecutors said.

At a February 2012 meeting, Low explained to Leissner, Ng and others that “government officials from Abu Dhabi and Malaysia needed to be bribed to both obtain the guarantee from IPIC and get the necessary approvals from Malaysia and 1MDB,” they said.

Goldman’s compliance employees were on notice to keep an eye out for any transactions that might involve Low, who was considered a significant risk. Yet in the 1MDB bond deals, they didn’t take “reasonable steps” to keep him out of it, according to the statement of facts.

For example, Goldman failed to review electronic communications of members of the deal team for evidence of Low’s involvement, which by 2012 would’ve shown Low’s role in the matter, the statement says.

Low, who has professed his innocence, remains at large. Leissner, who was the bank’s southeast Asia chairman, pleaded guilty in the U.S. to conspiring to launder money. He’ll be sentenced in January. Ng was charged with conspiring with Low to launder money. He has denied wrongdoing.

“The board views the 1MDB matter as an institutional failure, inconsistent with the high expectations it has for the firm,” Goldman’s board said in a statement Thursday announcing the executive pay cuts.

The Justice Department penalty against Goldman credits more than $1 billion in fines paid to other U.S. agencies and foreign authorities. That includes $400 million to the Securities and Exchange Commission, $150 million to New York’s Department of Financial Services and $154 million to the Federal Reserve. After disgorgements of Malaysia profits, the Justice Department places the total U.S. penalty at roughly $2.9 billion.

Goldman Sachs units will also pay $350 million to Hong Kong’s financial regulator, $122 million to Singapore’s government and 96.6 million pounds ($126 million) to the U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority, those bodies announced Thursday.

Goldman reached a settlement in July with Malaysia, which included a payment of $2.5 billion and an unusual provision that the bank would guarantee that the Asian nation would recoup an additional $1.4 billion from 1MDB assets seized around the world. Malaysia dropped criminal charges against the bank as part of that deal.

Goldman will seek U.S. Labor Department permission before the Malaysia unit’s December sentencing to continue handling retirement funds for Americans, its lawyers said. Banks must secure a waiver from the department to continue handling such funds after an admission of criminal conduct.

The 1MDB saga devolved into a plot to pressure the U.S. to go easy on some of the alleged looters, casting a wider web that has embroiled a prominent Republican fundraiser, an official in the Justice Department and even a former Fugees rap star.",bribery

Kobe Steel has been indicted for allegedly violating Japan's competition law after the firm admitted it had fabricated strength and quality data of products sold to hundreds of clients.

Kobe Steel, which is Japan's third-largest steelmaker, first admitted to the wrongdoing last year.

The firm said on Thursday it was deeply sorry ""for the enormous amount of worry and trouble"" it had caused its clients.

Kobe Steel supplies makers of cars, planes and trains around the world.

Manufacturing giants including Boeing, Toyota and General Motors have been investigating whether they used any of the sub-standard materials; however, no safety issues have yet been reported.

Federal authorities on Wednesday designated six reputed members of the notorious Mara Salvatrucha street gang, which was founded in Los Angeles, as leaders of a transnational criminal organization.

The designation by the U.S. Department of the Treasury generally bars U.S. citizens from conducting transactions with the six named leaders and allows their financial assets to be frozen by federal investigators, authorities said.

Known as MS-13, the gang was founded in the Pico-Union and Westlake neighborhoods of Los Angeles in the 1980s by Salvadoran refugees who had fled a civil war raging in their country.

A 2005 investigation by The Times found that years of deportations of MS-13 leaders from California helped spread the gang across Central America and Mexico and back into more than 30 states in the U.S.

Last year, MS-13 became the first street gang designated by the Treasury Department as a transnational criminal organization. The six reputed leaders identified by federal authorities Wednesday are all Salvadoran nationals and include the suspected Central American leader of the gang.

“These individuals are heavily involved in directing and participating in illicit activity, such as drug trafficking, money laundering, extortion and murder,” Treasury Department officials said in a statement.

The department identified the six suspected leaders as Moris Bercian Manchon, 28; Jose Misael Cisneros Rodriguez, 36; Marvin Geovanny Monterrosa-Larios, 35; Moises Humberto Rivera-Luna, 44; Saul Antonio Turcios Angel, 35; and Borromeo Enrique Henriquez Solorzano, 34. Solarzano is the reputed Central American leader of the gang, according to federal authorities.

Federal authorities said Wednesday that MS-13 has tens of thousands of members and is “one of the most dangerous criminal gangs in the world today.”
