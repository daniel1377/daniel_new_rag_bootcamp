Naples, November 15 - Police on Thursday arrested
Rosario Guarino, the presumed leader of the Girati Camorra mafia
clan based in the northern Neapolitan neighbourhood of Scampia.
The 29-year-old otherwise known as 'Joe Banana' had been
on the run since March 2011 and was found in a secret hideout in
Arzano just north of the southern coastal metropolis.
He was one of five fugitives whose names and photographs
were released in October in an invitation to the local
population for information about their whereabouts.
Interior Minister Annamaria Cancellieri congratulated the
national police chief Antonio Manganelli on the arrest.
"Once again my appreciation goes to the precious activity
of the police and judiciary who work daily to fight organised
crime and who today again carried out a brilliant operation,"
she said.
