Former Party of Democratic Action official Amir Zukic has joined a lengthy list of politicians from Bosnia and other former Yugoslav republics blacklisted by the US for corruption.

The US State Department has blacklisted Amir Zukic, a disgraced former high-ranking official of the main Bosniak Party of Democratic Action, SDA, for being involved in corruption.

Zuikic, who had served as a member of the parliament of Bosnia’s Federation entity for the SDA and as the party’s secretary-general, has been on trial for alleged involvement in illegal public-sector employment since 2018, following his arrest the year before.

“In his official capacity as a Member of the House of Representatives in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, FBiH, and as the General Secretary of the Party of Democratic Action, SDA, Zukic was involved in corrupt acts that undermined the rule of law in Bosnia and Herzegovina,” a statement from Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said.

Milorad Dodik, the Serbian member of Bosnia’s three-man presidency, is among dozens of people from Bosnian and ex-Yugoslav republics who have been blacklisted or whose assets have been frozen by the US government.

The US Treasury Department imposed travel and financial sanctions against Dodik in 2017 for obstructing the 1995 Dayton peace agreement that ended the 1992-5 civil war in Bosnia.
