MIAMI (Reuters) - A U.S. court sentenced the brother of jailed Colombian drug lord Diego Montoya to 30 years in prison on Tuesday for conspiring to import cocaine into the United States.

Eugenio Montoya Sanchez was a high-ranking member of the Norte del Valle cocaine cartel and was responsible for managing its finances, including maintaining cartel stash houses to store the cash proceeds of drug deals, prosecutors said.

Montoya Sanchez was arrested by Colombian authorities after a shootout in January 2007 and was extradited to Florida in June. He pleaded guilty in January in a federal court in Miami.

Montoya Sanchez told prosecutors the cartel kept up to $20 million (14 million pounds) in cash in stash houses around Colombia. He said he used drug proceeds to invest in real estate and outside businesses, as well as to fund cocaine labs and pay lab workers, cocaine transporters and security personnel.

He was the third member of the family convicted in the case. His brother Juan Carlos Montoya Sanchez and cousin Carlos Felipe Toro Sanchez both pleaded guilty to drug conspiracy charges in 2005 and were sentenced to 21 and 19 years in prison respectively.

Diego Montoya, who was extradited to Florida in December and is still awaiting trial, was a leading figure in Colombia’s underworld. He helped found the Norte del Valle cartel and appeared next to Osama bin Laden on the FBI’s “Ten Most Wanted” list.
