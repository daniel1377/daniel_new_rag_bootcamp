A judge has told prosecutors to investigate how a drug dealer managed to rake in at least £30,000 whilst jailed at three Scottish prisons, reports the Scottish Sun.

Craig Sutton, 37, pushed heroin in three jails across the country, including HMP Edinburgh in Saughton.

He successfully managed to push drugs between 2015 and 2017, and was only caught after a group of users in his cell set off a fire alarm.

Prison officers were said to have smelt burning, the court heard.

The man even bragged about his jailhouse enterprise in letters and phone calls, and a judge today asked prosecutors to investigate how it went unnoticed.

Prosecutor Mark McGuire said: “A smell of burning was noticed. The cell was searched and a small quantity of heroin was found, and drug-related paraphernalia and a suspected tick list," the Scottish Sun reported.

They found an unsent letter the Sutton had wrote ordering pals to get arrested and claim to be homeless so they could smuggle drugs into the prison.

He also spoke about the smuggling operation in phone calls which were recorded.
