Since no body was found, the entire world went looking for Israel and everyone was talking about his disappearance.

From the NY Times:

Is Samuel Israel III dead or alive?...the United States Marshals Service has termed him “armed and dangerous” and issued a wanted poster.

No body has turned up, and the marshals on Thursday were said to have questioned a driver whose car was seen near the area where Mr. Israel had abandoned his GMC Envoy, leaving behind the car keys and a bottle of pills. In addition to the marshals, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the United States attorney’s office, which oversaw the case, are involved in the search.

Former prosecutors and other law enforcement officials say that along with monitoring airports and border crossings, the police check credit cards and cellphones for any activity in fugitive cases. They also track the phones of friends, family, and in some cases even lawyers.
