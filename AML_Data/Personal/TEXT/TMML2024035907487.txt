MIAMI, Feb 1 (Reuters) - A Colombian drug lord was sentenced to 40 years in prison in Florida on Thursday and ordered to forfeit $110 million, authorities said.

In testimony during his four-month trial, witnesses said 49-year-old Joaquin Mario Valencia-Trujillo supplied more than 100 tons of cocaine annually to the U.S. market between the early 1990s and his arrest in Bogota in January 2003, the U.S. attorney's office for the Middle District of Florida said.

Valencia-Trujillo was extradited from his native Colombia in March 2004.

A Tampa, Florida, jury convicted him of all the drug, conspiracy and money-laundering charges against him last October.
