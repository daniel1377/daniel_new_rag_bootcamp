The indictment alleges McAfee earned millions from promoting cryptocurrencies, consulting work, speaking engagements and selling the rights to his life story for a documentary, but did not file tax returns from 2014 to 2018.

Authorities also allege McAfee concealed assets from the IRS, including real estate, a yacht, a car and cryptocurrency.

He was indicted on June 15, but the document was unsealed Monday after he was arrested in Spain, where he awaits extradition to the U.S.

McAfee admitted last year to not paying taxes in a video posted on Twitter, where he also said he was fleeing the country and running for president “in exile” because of an IRS investigation.
