MANILA, Philippines–An Iranian national arrested by the National Bureau of Investigation on the request of the US Department of Justice after he was indicted in a US court for being part of a conspiracy to smuggle to Iran about 20 tons of specialized steel “with nuclear applications” died Monday evening of cardiac arrest, an NBI official said.

The US justice department told the NBI the Iranian was indicted in the District Court of Columbia for being part of a conspiracy to smuggle to Iran about 20 tons of specialized steel “with nuclear applications” which were considered suitable for gas centrifuges used in uranium enrichment.

Money laundering

Records showed Khaki was also charged by the US justice department with money laundering and violating US laws with respect to the American embargo against Iran.

NBI records showed the Iranian was on his way back to Iran when he was arrested by NBI agents at Naia Terminal 1 on May 26, 2012.

Khaki’s extradition to the US did not push through, however, after the Iranian Embassy filed a petition in Manila Regional Trial Court Branch 21 opposing his extradition.

The Iranian remained in NBI custody while his extradition case was pending in the Manila court.

NBI foreign liaison chief Daniel Daganzo said Khaki suffered a heart attack around 8 p.m. on Monday and was rushed to the Manila Doctors Hospital but he succumbed around 11 p.m.

He said that with the death, Khaki’s case would now be handled by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Department of Justice.

“We no longer have jurisdiction over his body, it’s now under the purview of the DFA and the DOJ,” Daganzo said.
